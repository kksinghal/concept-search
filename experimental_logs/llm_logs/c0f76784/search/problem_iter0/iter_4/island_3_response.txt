## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontal and vertical lines of length 3 formed by the digit '5' within the input grid. These lines are then replaced with different digits in the output grid:

* **Horizontal lines:** Replaced with the digit '8' except for the horizontal line at the top of an object, which is replaced with '5'.
* **Vertical lines:** Replaced with the digit '7' except for the vertical line at the leftmost side of an object, which is replaced with '5'.
* **Intersections:** If a cell is part of both a horizontal and a vertical line, it's replaced with '6'.

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
* A horizontal line of '5's exists in rows 2, 3, and 4, spanning columns 8-10. This line is replaced with '8's in the output.
* Another horizontal line exists in row 7, columns 8-10, and is replaced with '5's as it forms the top of the object.
* Similarly, vertical lines are replaced with '7's in the output, except for the line in row 8, columns 9-10, which is replaced with '5's as it forms the leftmost side of the object.
* The cell at (3, 9) is part of both a horizontal and vertical line and is replaced with '6'.

**Input_1:** 
* Similar logic is applied to identify and replace horizontal and vertical lines of '5's. 
* The topmost horizontal line and leftmost vertical line of each object are treated differently, replaced with '5's instead of '8's and '7's respectively.

**Input_2:**
* The same transformation logic applies consistently to this input as well.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the DSL, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  indices = asindices(I)
  hline_indices = mpapply(lambda i, j: (i, j + 1) if j < width(I) - 2 and all(I[i][j+k] == 5 for k in range(3)) and any(I[i-1][j+l] != 5 for l in range(3)) else None, *indices)
  vline_indices = mpapply(lambda i, j: (i + 1, j) if i < height(I) - 2 and all(I[i+k][j] == 5 for k in range(3)) and any(I[i+l][j-1] != 5 for l in range(3)) else None, *indices)
  I = fill(I, 8, hline_indices)
  I = fill(I, 7, vline_indices)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **`indices = asindices(I)`:** Gets all indices of the input grid.
* **`hline_indices` and `vline_indices`:** These use `mpapply` to find the middle indices of horizontal and vertical lines of '5's respectively. The added condition `any(I[i-1][j+l] != 5 for l in range(3))` ensures that the topmost horizontal line is not included. Similarly, `any(I[i+l][j-1] != 5 for l in range(3))` excludes the leftmost vertical line.
* **`I = fill(I, 8, hline_indices)`:** Fills '8' at the identified horizontal line indices.
* **`I = fill(I, 7, vline_indices)`:** Fills '7' at the identified vertical line indices. 
* **`O = I`:** Assigns the modified grid to the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  hline = prapply(lambda i, j: (i, j + 1) if j < width(I) - 2 and all(I[i][j + k] == 5 for k in range(3)) else None, *asindices(I))
  vline = prapply(lambda i, j: (i + 1, j) if i < height(I) - 2 and all(I[i + k][j] == 5 for k in range(3)) else None, *asindices(I))
  I = fill(I, 8, difference(hline, vline))
  I = fill(I, 7, difference(vline, hline))
  I = fill(I, 6, intersection(hline, vline))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **`hline` and `vline`:** Similar to version 1, these find indices of horizontal and vertical lines of '5's.
* **`difference(hline, vline)`:** This gets indices that are part of horizontal lines but not vertical lines.
* **`difference(vline, hline)`:** This gets indices that are part of vertical lines but not horizontal lines.
* **`intersection(hline, vline)`:** This gets indices that are part of both horizontal and vertical lines (intersections).
* The program then fills '8', '7', and '6' at their corresponding indices, effectively handling the different cases.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, False, True)
  hline = mfilter(lambda o: hline(o) and width(o) == 3, obj)
  vline = mfilter(lambda o: vline(o) and height(o) == 3, obj)
  I = fill(I, 8, difference(mapply(lambda x: shift(x, (0, 1)), hline), vline))
  I = fill(I, 7, difference(mapply(lambda x: shift(x, (1, 0)), vline), hline))
  I = fill(I, 6, intersection(mapply(lambda x: shift(x, (0, 1)), hline), mapply(lambda x: shift(x, (1, 0)), vline)))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses object-based processing.
* **`obj = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extracts objects from the input grid.
* **`hline` and `vline`:** These filter out objects that are horizontal and vertical lines of length 3, respectively.
* The rest of the program is similar to version 2, but it operates on objects instead of individual indices. It shifts the objects appropriately to find the correct locations for filling '8', '7', and '6'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  for i in range(height(I) - 2):
    for j in range(width(I) - 2):
      if all(I[i][j+k] == 5 for k in range(3)) and any(I[i-1][j+l] != 5 for l in range(3)):
        I = fill(I, 8, {(i, j+1)})
      if all(I[i+k][j] == 5 for k in range(3)) and any(I[i+l][j-1] != 5 for l in range(3)):
        I = fill(I, 7, {(i+1, j)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses nested loops to iterate through the grid and directly checks for horizontal and vertical lines of '5's using slicing. 
* Similar to previous versions, it excludes the topmost horizontal and leftmost vertical lines.
* If a line is found, it fills the corresponding cell with '8' or '7'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if i > 0 and i < h - 1 and j < w - 2 and all(I[i][j+k] == 5 for k in range(3)) and any(I[i-1][j+l] != 5 for l in range(3)):
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j+1)})
      if j > 0 and j < w - 1 and i < h - 2 and all(I[i+k][j] == 5 for k in range(3)) and any(I[i+l][j-1] != 5 for l in range(3)):
        O = fill(O, 7, {(i+1, j)})
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version initializes an empty output grid (`O`) and iterates through both input and output grids simultaneously.
* It checks for horizontal and vertical lines within the input grid, excluding topmost horizontal and leftmost vertical lines.
* If a line is found, it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with '8' or '7'.
* If no line is found, it copies the value from the input grid to the output grid.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes distinct logic and combinations of DSL functions, highlighting diverse ways to process spatial information and manipulate grids.
