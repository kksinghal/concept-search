['Change the color of the shapes to blue if they are made of three blocks, red if they are made of two blocks, and green if they are made of one block.', 'If a shape is made up of three blocks, color it blue. If it is made up of two blocks, color it red. If it is made up of one block, color it green.', 'Transform the shapes based on their size: three-block shapes become blue, two-block shapes become red, and single-block shapes become green.', 'Recolor the shapes according to the number of blocks they contain: blue for three blocks, red for two blocks, and green for one block.', 'Apply a color code to the shapes: blue for three-block shapes, red for two-block shapes, and green for single-block shapes.

']['The transformation involves taking each colored square from the input grid and creating a larger, rectangular shape with it in the output grid. The size and orientation of the rectangle depend on the position of the square in the input. Additionally, a separate diagonal line of blue squares is added to the output grid, independent of the input squares.', "For each colored square in the input, a corresponding shape is drawn in the output. The shape's size and orientation are determined by the original square's location. A separate diagonal line of blue squares is also added to the output, independent of the input.", 'Each colored square in the input grid dictates the size and orientation of a corresponding shape in the output grid. A diagonal line of blue squares is then added to the output, independent of the input squares.', 'The input grid determines the size and orientation of shapes that appear in the output grid. Each colored square corresponds to a specific shape. Additionally, a diagonal line of blue squares is drawn in the output, unrelated to the input.', "The transformation creates an output grid with shapes derived from the input grid's colored squares. Each shape's size and orientation depend on the corresponding square's position. A separate diagonal line of blue squares is also present in the output, independent of the input. "]
