## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Upscale:** The object formed by digit '2' is upscaled by a factor of 2. 
2. **Duplicate & Position:** Two copies of the upscaled object are placed at specific locations: the top-left and the bottom-right of a 10x10 canvas.
3. **New Object:** A new object resembling an 'L' shape, formed by the digit '1', is placed below the top-left upscaled object.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **Upscale:** The object formed by digit '2' is upscaled by a factor of 2.
2. **Duplicate & Position:** Two copies of the upscaled object are placed at specific locations: the top-left and the bottom-right of a 10x10 canvas.
3. **New Object:** Two new objects are introduced:
    - An 'L' shape formed by digit '1' is placed below the top-left upscaled object.
    - A vertical line formed by digit '1' is placed on the right edge of the canvas, slightly overlapping the top-right upscaled object.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

1. **Upscale:** The object formed by digit '2' is upscaled by a factor of 2. 
2. **Duplicate & Position:** Two copies of the upscaled object are placed at specific locations: the top-right and the bottom-left of a 10x10 canvas.
3. **New Object:** Two new objects are introduced:
    - An inverted 'L' shape formed by digit '1' is placed on the top-left of the canvas, slightly overlapping the top-right upscaled object.
    - A vertical line formed by digit '1' is placed on the right edge of the canvas. 

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    upscaled_objs = apply(lambda obj: upscale(obj, 2), objs)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    
    if len(upscaled_objs) == 1:
        obj = first(upscaled_objs)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (2, 2)))
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (6, 5)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(crop(canvas(0, (3,3)), (1,1), (2,2)), (6,1))))
    elif len(upscaled_objs) == 2:
        obj1, obj2 = first(upscaled_objs), last(upscaled_objs)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj1, (1, 1)))
        O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (5, 6)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(crop(canvas(0, (3,3)), (1,1), (2,2)), (0,0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift({(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)}, (7, 5))))
    else:
        obj1 = first(upscaled_objs)
        obj2 = list(upscaled_objs - {obj1})[0]
        obj3 = list(upscaled_objs - {obj1, obj2})[0] 
        O = paint(O, shift(obj1, (7, 0)))
        O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (6, 0)))
        O = paint(O, shift(obj3, (5, 4)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(crop(canvas(0, (3,3)), (1,1), (2,2)), (-1, -1))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift({(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)}, (7, 4))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses conditional statements to handle different input scenarios based on the number of objects. 
- It utilizes `crop` and `shift` to create the 'L' shaped objects and positions them accordingly.
