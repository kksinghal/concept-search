## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

1. **Identify the main object:** The input has a single object formed by the digit '2'.
2. **Replicate and shift:** The object is replicated twice and shifted:
    - One replica is shifted down and right by 2 cells.
    - The other replica is shifted down by 5 cells and right by 6 cells.
3. **Add new '1' elements:** A small object of '1's is added at the bottom left, forming an 'L' shape. 
    - If there was more than one object initially, the 'L' shape would have an extra '1' at the bottom.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

1. **Identify the main object:** Again, there's a single '2' object.
2. **Replicate and shift:** The object is replicated and shifted in three ways:
    - One replica is shifted down by 1 cell and right by 1 cell.
    - Another is shifted down by 2 cells.
    - The last one is shifted down by 6 cells and right by 5 cells.
3. **Add new '1' elements:**  An 'L' shape of '1's is added, but this time it's rotated and placed at the top right. 
    - Similar to the previous transformation, the 'L' would have an extra '1' if there were more initial objects.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**

1. **Identify all objects:** This input has multiple '2' objects.
2. **Shift objects:** Each object is individually shifted:
    - The top left object is shifted up by 1 cell.
    - The top right object is shifted up by 1 cell and right by 3 cells.
    - The bottom left object is shifted down by 4 cells.
3. **Add new '1' elements:** Two 'L' shapes of '1's are added:
    - One at the top left is standard.
    - Another, at the bottom right, is rotated. 
    - Both 'L' shapes have the extra '1' because of multiple initial objects.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Object-Centric):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  new_ones = frozenset({(1, (7, 1)), (1, (8, 1)), (1, (8, 2))})
  if objs:
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
      if i == 0:
        shifted_objs = shifted_objs | {shift(obj, (2, 2))}
      elif i == 1:
        shifted_objs = shifted_objs | {shift(obj, (5, 6))}
      elif i == 2:
        shifted_objs = shifted_objs | {shift(obj, (-1, 0))}
      elif i == 3:
        shifted_objs = shifted_objs | {shift(obj, (1, 3))}
      elif i == 4:
        shifted_objs = shifted_objs | {shift(obj, (4, 0))}
  if len(objs) > 1:
    new_ones = new_ones | {(1, (8, 3))}
  return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), objs | shifted_objs | new_ones) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(grid, True, False, True)` extracts objects from the grid.
2. **Shift objects:** Iterates through objects and applies specific shifts based on their index.
3. **Add new elements:**  Constructs the 'L' shape of '1's, adding the extra element if necessary.
4. **Combine and paint:**  Combines all objects and paints them onto a blank canvas.


**Version 2 (Grid Manipulation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  g1 = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(objects(grid, True, False, True), (2, 2)))
  g2 = paint(g1, shift(objects(grid, True, False, True), (5, 6)))
  g3 = paint(g2, {(1, (7, 1)), (1, (8, 1)), (1, (8, 2))})
  return paint(g3, {(1, (8, 3))}) if len(objects(grid, True, False, True)) > 1 else g3
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create base grid:**  Starts with a blank canvas.
2. **Paint shifted objects:**  Extracts objects, shifts them, and paints them onto the canvas.
3. **Add 'L' shape:**  Paints the base 'L' shape of '1's.
4. **Conditional paint:**  Adds the extra '1' to the 'L' shape based on the initial object count.


**Version 3 (Functional Approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return branch(
    len(objects(grid, True, False, True)) > 1, 
    paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(objects(grid, True, False, True), (2, 2))), shift(objects(grid, True, False, True), (5, 6))), {(1, (7, 1)), (1, (8, 1)), (1, (8, 2)), (1, (8, 3))}),
    paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(objects(grid, True, False, True), (2, 2))), shift(objects(grid, True, False, True), (5, 6))), {(1, (7, 1)), (1, (8, 1)), (1, (8, 2))})
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Conditional branching:** Uses `branch` to choose between two painting routines based on object count.
2. **Nested painting:**  Employs nested `paint` calls to sequentially add shifted objects and 'L' shapes.


**Version 4 (Decomposition):**

```python
def generate_shifted(grid):
  shifted = frozenset()
  for i, obj in enumerate(objects(grid, True, False, True)):
    if i == 0:
      shifted = shifted | {shift(obj, (2, 2))}
    # Add other shift conditions here
  return shifted

def generate_ones(grid):
  base = {(1, (7, 1)), (1, (8, 1)), (1, (8, 2))}
  return base | {(1, (8, 3))} if len(objects(grid, True, False, True)) > 1 else base

def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), objects(grid, True, False, True) | generate_shifted(grid) | generate_ones(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Decomposed functions:**  Uses separate functions (`generate_shifted`, `generate_ones`) to handle object shifting and 'L' shape creation.
2. **Combine and paint:**  The main function combines the results and paints them onto a blank canvas.


**Version 5 (Pattern Recognition - Incomplete):**

**(This version attempts to generalize the pattern but needs further refinement. It's included to demonstrate diverse approaches.)**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (2 * i + 1, 2 * i)) for i, obj in enumerate(objs))
  base_ones = {(1, (7, 1)), (1, (8, 1)), (1, (8, 2))}
  new_ones = base_ones | {(1, (8, i + 3)) for i in range(len(objs) - 1)} 
  return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), objs | shifted_objs | new_ones)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Extracts objects from the grid.
2. **Generalize shifting:** Attempts to apply a general shifting pattern based on object index.
3. **Dynamic 'L' shape:**  Generates the 'L' shape dynamically, adding elements based on object count.
4. **Combine and paint:**  Combines all elements and paints them onto a blank canvas.

This version highlights the challenges of fully automating pattern recognition and generalization in code generation.
