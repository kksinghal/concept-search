## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to follow these rules:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify the two distinct objects in the input grid (represented by '2' and ignoring the background '0').
2. **Upscale:**  Upscale both objects by a factor of 2.
3. **Shift:** Shift the first object down by 2 units and right by 2 units. Shift the second object down by 5 units and right by 5 units. 
4. **Add New Object:** Introduce a new object represented by '1' with dimensions 2x3.  Shift it down by 7 units and right by 1 unit.
5. **Combine:**  Place all three transformed objects onto a 10x10 canvas initialized with '0'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Input_0, identify the two distinct objects.
2. **Upscale:** Upscale both objects by a factor of 2.
3. **Shift:** Shift the first object down by 1 unit and right by 1 unit. Shift the second object down by 6 units and right by 5 units.
4. **Add New Object:**  Introduce a new object represented by '1' with a slightly different shape than Output_0. Shift it down by 4 units and right by 2 units.
5. **Combine:** Place all three transformed objects onto a 10x10 canvas initialized with '0'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous inputs, identify the two distinct objects.
2. **Upscale:** Upscale both objects by a factor of 2.
3. **Shift:** Shift the first object right by 6 units. Shift the second object right by 7 units.
4. **Add New Object:** Introduce a new object represented by '1' with a different shape compared to Output_0 and Output_1. Shift it down by 1 unit.
5. **Combine:** Place all three transformed objects onto a 10x10 canvas initialized with '0'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the above transformation logic:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = upscale(first(objects(I, T, F, T)), 2)
  obj2 = upscale(last(objects(I, T, F, T)), 2)
  obj3 = upscale({(1, (0, 0)), (1, (0, 1)), (1, (1, 0)), (1, (1, 1)), (1, (2, 0))}, 1) # New object
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(obj1, (2, 2))), shift(obj2, (5, 5))), shift(obj3, (7, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification & Upscaling:** This version directly identifies and upscales the two objects from the input grid using nested function calls. 
2. **New Object Creation:** A new object (`obj3`) is explicitly defined as a set of cells.
3. **Shifting & Painting:** Each object is shifted to its target location and painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj1 = shift(upscale(first(objs), 2), (2, 2))
  obj2 = shift(upscale(last(objs), 2), (5, 5))
  obj3 = shift(upscale({(1, (0, 0)), (1, (1, 0)), (1, (0, 1)), (1, (1, 1)), (1, (2, 0))}, 1), (7, 1))
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), obj1)
  O = paint(O, obj2)
  O = paint(O, obj3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Separate Shifting & Upscaling:** This version separates the upscaling and shifting operations for better readability. 
2. **Stepwise Painting:** It paints each object onto the canvas in separate steps.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_obj(obj, scale, offset):
    return shift(upscale(obj, scale), offset)
  
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj1 = transform_obj(first(objs), 2, (2, 2))
  obj2 = transform_obj(last(objs), 2, (5, 5))
  obj3 = transform_obj({(1, (0, 0)), (1, (1, 0)), (1, (0, 1)), (1, (1, 1)), (1, (2, 0))}, 1, (7, 1))
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), obj1)
  O = paint(O, obj2)
  O = paint(O, obj3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function for Transformation:**  This version introduces a helper function `transform_obj` to encapsulate the upscaling and shifting logic.
2. **Code Reusability:**  Using the helper function improves code reusability and readability.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for obj, scale, offset in zip(objs, (2, 2, 1), ((2, 2), (5, 5), (7, 1))):
    O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj, scale), offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Transformation:** This version uses a loop to iterate through the objects and their corresponding scaling and offset values.
2. **Compact Code:**  The loop structure results in more compact and efficient code.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1, obj2 = (upscale(obj, 2) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)) 
  obj3 = upscale({(1, (0, 0)), (1, (1, 0)), (1, (0, 1)), (1, (1, 1)), (1, (2, 0))}, 1)
  return paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(obj1, (2, 2))), shift(obj2, (5, 5))), shift(obj3, (7, 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Generator Expression:** Utilizes a generator expression for compactly upscaling the first two objects. 
2. **Direct Return:**  Directly returns the final painted canvas without assigning it to an intermediate variable.

These are just a few examples of how you can implement the transformation logic using the provided DSL.  There are likely many other valid and efficient solutions possible.  The key is to understand the underlying pattern and apply the appropriate functions in a logical and readable manner.
