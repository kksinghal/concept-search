## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

1. **Object Duplication and Shifting:** The single object in the input grid (composed of '2's) is duplicated twice. The original object remains in place, while the first duplicate is shifted three rows down and two columns right, and the second duplicate is shifted six rows down and five columns right. 
2. **New Object Creation:** A new object composed of '1's is created. It has a vertical line segment spanning three cells from (7,0) to (7,2) and a horizontal line segment spanning three cells from (8,0) to (8,2), forming an 'L' shape.
3. **Canvas Expansion and Painting:** The final output is painted onto a 10x10 canvas filled with '0's.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

1. **Object Shifting and Extension:** The single object in the input grid (composed of '2's) is shifted one row down.  Additionally, two '2's are added to the right of this object, extending it horizontally.
2. **New Object Creation:**  A new object composed of '1's is created. It consists of three segments: a vertical line on the rightmost column, a three-cell horizontal line segment from (5,3) to (5,5), and a two-cell horizontal segment from (1,6) to (1,7).
3. **Canvas Expansion and Painting:** The final output is painted onto a 10x10 canvas filled with '0's.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**

1. **Object Transformation and Positioning:** The input grid has two objects. The first object (top-left '2's) is transformed into a horizontal line of three '1's at the top. The second object (bottom '2's) is shifted to the rightmost column and retains its original shape.
2. **New Object Creation:**  A new object composed of '1's is created. It consists of several segments forming a diagonal line with some gaps, as well as two small horizontal segments.
3. **Canvas Expansion and Painting:** The final output is painted onto a 10x10 canvas filled with '0's.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformations:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  if len(objs) == 1:
    obj = first(objs)
    shifted_obj1 = shift(obj, (3, 2))
    shifted_obj2 = shift(obj, (6, 5))
    new_ones = {(1, (i, 7)) for i in range(3)} | {(1, (8, j)) for j in range(3)} | {(1, (7, 2))}
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), objs | {shifted_obj1} | {shifted_obj2} | new_ones)
  elif len(objs) == 2:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    shifted_obj1 = shift(obj1, (1, 3))
    obj2_indices = toindices(obj2)
    shifted_obj2 = shift(obj2_indices, (6, 5))
    new_ones = {(1, (i, 9)) for i in range(10)} | {(1, (j, 6 + j)) for j in range(4)} | {(1, (5, 7))} 
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), {obj1} | {shifted_obj1} | {shifted_obj2} | new_ones)
  else:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    shifted_obj1 = shift(obj1, (-1, 0))
    obj2_indices = toindices(obj2)
    rotated_obj2 = rot270(obj2_indices)
    shifted_obj2 = shift(rotated_obj2, (0, 6))
    new_ones = {(1, (0, i)) for i in range(3)} | {(1, (1, j)) for j in range(1, 3)} | {(1, (2, 2))} | {(1, (5, 5))} | {(1, (6, 6))} | {(1, (7, 7))} | {(1, (9, k)) for k in range(6, 8)}
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), {shifted_obj1} | {shifted_obj2} | new_ones)
```

**Explanation:**

* This version leverages `objects` function to identify objects, then uses conditional branching based on the number of objects. 
* It uses `shift`, `rot270`, and set operations to manipulate objects and create new ones with '1's.
* Finally, it paints all objects onto a 10x10 canvas using `paint` and `canvas`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  if len(objs) == 1:
    obj = first(objs)
    duplicated_obj1 = shift(obj, (3, 2))
    duplicated_obj2 = shift(obj, (6, 5))
    new_obj = recolor(1, {(i, 7) for i in range(3)} | {(8, j) for j in range(3)} | {(7, 2)})
    return paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), obj), duplicated_obj1), duplicated_obj2) | new_obj
  elif len(objs) == 2:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    obj1_shifted = shift(obj1, (1, 3))
    obj2_shifted = shift(toindices(obj2), (6, 5))
    new_obj = recolor(1, {(i, 9) for i in range(10)} | {(j, 6 + j) for j in range(4)} | {(5, 7)})
    return paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), obj1), obj1_shifted), obj2_shifted) | new_obj
  else:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    obj1_shifted = shift(obj1, (-1, 0))
    obj2_rotated = rot270(toindices(obj2))
    obj2_transformed = shift(obj2_rotated, (0, 6))
    new_obj = recolor(1, {(0, i) for i in range(3)} | {(1, j) for j in range(1, 3)} | {(2, 2)} | {(5, 5)} | {(6, 6)} | {(7, 7)} | {(9, k) for k in range(6, 8)})
    return paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), obj1_shifted), obj2_transformed) | new_obj 
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes `recolor` to directly create new objects with the desired color ('1') instead of building them cell by cell.
* It uses nested `paint` calls for a more compact representation of painting multiple objects onto the canvas.



**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  canvas_with_objs = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for obj in objs:
    canvas_with_objs = paint(canvas_with_objs, obj)
  if len(objs) == 1:
    canvas_with_objs = paint(canvas_with_objs, shift(first(objs), (3, 2)))
    canvas_with_objs = paint(canvas_with_objs, shift(first(objs), (6, 5)))
    new_obj = recolor(1, {(i, 7) for i in range(3)} | {(8, j) for j in range(3)} | {(7, 2)})
    return canvas_with_objs | new_obj
  elif len(objs) == 2:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    canvas_with_objs = paint(canvas_with_objs, shift(obj1, (1, 3)))
    canvas_with_objs = paint(canvas_with_objs, shift(toindices(obj2), (6, 5)))
    new_obj = recolor(1, {(i, 9) for i in range(10)} | {(j, 6 + j) for j in range(4)} | {(5, 7)})
    return canvas_with_objs | new_obj
  else:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    canvas_with_objs = paint(canvas_with_objs, shift(obj1, (-1, 0)))
    canvas_with_objs = paint(canvas_with_objs, shift(rot270(toindices(obj2)), (0, 6)))
    new_obj = recolor(1, {(0, i) for i in range(3)} | {(1, j) for j in range(1, 3)} | {(2, 2)} | {(5, 5)} | {(6, 6)} | {(7, 7)} | {(9, k) for k in range(6, 8)})
    return canvas_with_objs | new_obj
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses a loop to paint all initial objects onto the canvas before applying any transformations.
* It then uses conditional branching to apply specific transformations and create new objects based on the number of initial objects. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  if len(objs) == 1:
    obj = first(objs)
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), objs | {shift(obj, (3, 2))} | {shift(obj, (6, 5))} | recolor(1, {(i, 7) for i in range(3)} | {(8, j) for j in range(3)} | {(7, 2)})) 
  elif len(objs) == 2:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), {obj1} | {shift(obj1, (1, 3))} | {shift(toindices(obj2), (6, 5))} | recolor(1, {(i, 9) for i in range(10)} | {(j, 6 + j) for j in range(4)} | {(5, 7)}))
  else:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), {shift(obj1, (-1, 0))} | {shift(rot270(toindices(obj2)), (0, 6))} | recolor(1, {(0, i) for i in range(3)} | {(1, j) for j in range(1, 3)} | {(2, 2)} | {(5, 5)} | {(6, 6)} | {(7, 7)} | {(9, k) for k in range(6, 8)}))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version simplifies the structure by combining object painting and new object creation within a single `paint` call for each conditional branch.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  new_obj = frozenset()
  if len(objs) == 1:
    obj = first(objs)
    objs = objs | {shift(obj, (3, 2))} | {shift(obj, (6, 5))}
    new_obj = recolor(1, {(i, 7) for i in range(3)} | {(8, j) for j in range(3)} | {(7, 2)})
  elif len(objs) == 2:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    objs = {obj1} | {shift(obj1, (1, 3))} | {shift(toindices(obj2), (6, 5))}
    new_obj = recolor(1, {(i, 9) for i in range(10)} | {(j, 6 + j) for j in range(4)} | {(5, 7)}) 
  else:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    objs = {shift(obj1, (-1, 0))} | {shift(rot270(toindices(obj2)), (0, 6))} 
    new_obj =  recolor(1, {(0, i) for i in range(3)} | {(1, j) for j in range(1, 3)} | {(2, 2)} | {(5, 5)} | {(6, 6)} | {(7, 7)} | {(9, k) for k in range(6, 8)})
  return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), objs | new_obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

* This version first manipulates the `objs` set directly based on the number of objects.
* It then creates the `new_obj` based on the specific transformation required.
* Finally, it paints all objects from the modified `objs` set and the `new_obj` onto the canvas. 

These five program versions provide distinct solutions using different combinations of DSL functions and logic while achieving the same desired transformation for each input-output pair.
