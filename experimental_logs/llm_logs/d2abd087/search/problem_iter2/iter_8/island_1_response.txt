## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Upscale:** The input object (formed by 2s) is upscaled by a factor of 2.
2. **Placement:** The upscaled object is placed in the top-left corner (indices (1,1)) of a larger canvas (10x10).
3. **New Object:**  A new horizontal line object (formed by 1s) is created below the upscaled object, with a one-cell gap.
4. **Second Upscaled Object:** A second copy of the upscaled object is placed further down, aligned to the right with the horizontal line object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Upscale:** The input object is upscaled by a factor of 2.
2. **Placement:** The upscaled object is placed towards the bottom-left corner of the larger canvas.
3. **New Objects:** Three new objects are created:
    - A horizontal line above the upscaled object.
    - A vertical line to the right of the canvas.
    - A small square in the top-right corner. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

1. **Upscale:** Each object in the input is upscaled by a factor of 2.
2. **Placement:** The upscaled objects are placed in a diagonal pattern across the canvas. 
3. **New Objects:** New objects (formed by 1s) are strategically placed to create a visually connected pattern with the upscaled objects.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def feeicejechjdeibgjchhcbeaidaajcge(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    new_grid = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), 2))
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
        upscaled_obj = upscale(obj, 2)
        position = (1 + i * 3, 1 + i * 2)  # Diagonal placement
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(upscaled_obj, position))
        new_obj_shape = branch(i == 0,
                              shift(hline(obj), (1, 0)), # Below first object
                              branch(i == 1,
                                     shift(vline(obj), (9, 0)), # Right edge
                                     {(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)})) # Fixed shape 
        new_obj = recolor(1, new_obj_shape)
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(new_obj, position))
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each object, upscales it, and places it diagonally.
- Creates a different new object based on the object's index:
    - Below the first object.
    - On the right edge for the second object.
    - A fixed shape for the third object (if it exists).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def bbdhbccbhfhcegebagjjafbecebaadce(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_grid = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), 2))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    upscaled_obj = upscale(obj, 2)
    position = (1 + i * 3, 1 + i * 2) if i > 0 else (1, 1) # Diagonal, first at (1,1)
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(upscaled_obj, position))
    new_obj_shape = branch(i == 0, 
                          shift(hline(obj), (1, 0)), # Below
                          branch(i == 1, 
                                 shift(vline(obj), (0, 9)), # Right
                                 shift(crop(canvas(0,(3,3)),(1,1),(2,2)), (0, 0)))) # Square
    new_obj = recolor(1, new_obj_shape)
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(new_obj, position))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 1 but uses a conditional for the first object's position.
- Defines new object shapes: line below the first, line on the right for the second, and a square for the third. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def agdijbacafaaefcfafdfjddhacjiajdf(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    upscaled_objs = apply(lambda obj: upscale(obj, 2), objs)
    new_grid = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), 2)) 
    for i, obj in enumerate(upscaled_objs):
        position = (1 + i * 3, 1 + i)  # Adjusted diagonal placement
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, position)) 
        new_obj_shape = branch(i == 0,
                              shift(hline(obj), (1, 0)), # Below first object
                              branch(i == 1,
                                     vfrontier((9, 0)), # Right edge
                                     {(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)})) # Fixed shape 
        new_obj = recolor(1, new_obj_shape)
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(new_obj, position))
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Upscales all objects first. 
- Similar placement logic to Version 1 but with adjusted diagonal spacing.
- Uses `vfrontier` to create the vertical line on the right edge.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def adaajfdcjeceejehjdegbffhcibfcefg(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    new_grid = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), 2))
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
        upscaled_obj = upscale(obj, 2)
        position = (1, 1 + i * 4) if i < 2 else (6, 5) # Vertical, last at (6,5) 
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(upscaled_obj, position))
        new_obj_shape = branch(i == 0,
                              shift(hline(obj), (1, 0)), # Below
                              branch(i == 1,
                                     shift(crop(canvas(0,(3,3)),(1,1),(2,2)), (0, 0)), # Square
                                     {(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)})) # Fixed shape
        new_obj = recolor(1, new_obj_shape)
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(new_obj, position))
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Places objects vertically with the last object at a fixed position.
- Uses conditional logic for new object shapes: a line below the first, a square for the second, and a fixed shape for the third. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def eafebdjdgdffefjabjbbbiejabbdafcc(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    new_grid = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), 2))
    main_obj = first(objs) 
    upscaled_main = upscale(main_obj, 2)
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(upscaled_main, (1, 1))) 
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
        if obj == main_obj:
            continue
        upscaled_obj = upscale(obj, 2)
        position = (1 + i * 3, 6)  # Placement relative to the first object
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(upscaled_obj, position))
        new_obj_shape = branch(i == 1,
                              shift(hline(obj), (1, 0)), # Below second object
                              branch(i == 2,
                                     shift(vline(obj), (0, 1)), # Right of third object
                                     {(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)})) # Fixed shape 
        new_obj = recolor(1, new_obj_shape)
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(new_obj, position))
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Designates the first object as the "main" object and places it in the top-left corner.
- Positions other objects relative to the main object.
- Creates new objects based on their index relative to the main object.
