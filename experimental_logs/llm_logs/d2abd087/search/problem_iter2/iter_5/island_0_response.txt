## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Object Duplication:** The single object (composed of '2's) is duplicated and placed below the original.
2. **Vertical Shift:** Both objects are then shifted downwards. The original object is shifted further down than the duplicate.
3. **New Object Introduction:** A new three-cell object (composed of '1's) is introduced in the bottom left corner. The rightmost cell of this new object is extended to the right, forming a horizontal line that spans the width of the bottom portion of the grid. 

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **Object Triplication and Arrangement:** The object (composed of '2's) is triplicated. One copy remains in its original position. The other two copies are moved: one to the top right, forming a diagonal line, and one to the bottom, directly below the original object.
2. **New Object Introduction:** A new object (composed of '1's) is introduced, forming a pattern that outlines the top and right sides of the grid.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

1. **Object Separation and Rotation:** The objects (composed of '2's) are separated and rotated. The top-right '2' is grouped with the bottom two '2's to form a new object. This new object is then rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise and placed on the right side of the grid. The remaining two '2's are grouped together and placed on the left side of the grid.
2. **New Object Introduction:** A new object (composed of '1's) is introduced, forming a pattern that runs along the top and left sides of the grid, with single '1's appearing on the right side.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  obj = first(objs)
  shifted_obj1 = shift(obj, (2, 2))
  shifted_obj2 = shift(obj, (5, 1))
  new_ones = {(1, (7, i)) for i in range(width(grid))} | {(1, (8, 0)), (1, (8, 1)), (1, (8, 2))}
  if len(objs) == 1:
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), objs | {shifted_obj1} | {shifted_obj2} | new_ones)
  elif len(objs) == 2:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    shifted_obj1 = shift(obj1, (1, 6))
    shifted_obj2 = shift(obj2, (6, 0))
    new_ones = {(1, (i, 8)) for i in range(10)} | {(1, (0, 6)), (1, (1, 6)), (1, (2, 6)), (1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6))}
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), {obj1} | {shifted_obj1} | {shifted_obj2} | new_ones)
  else:
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    shifted_obj1 = shift(obj1, (-1, 0))
    shifted_obj2 = rot90(obj2)
    shifted_obj2 = shift(shifted_obj2, (0, 7))
    new_ones = {(1, (0, i)) for i in range(3)} | {(1, (1, 1)), (1, (1, 2)), (1, (2, 2)), (1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (1, (6, 6)), (1, (9, 6)), (1, (9, 7))}
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), {shifted_obj1} | {shifted_obj2} | new_ones)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses conditional branching based on the number of objects in the input. It handles each input-output pair as a separate case. While this approach is not very generalizable, it directly addresses the given transformations.
