## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. The input grid contains two separate '2' objects. 
2. The larger object is upscaled by a factor of 2 and shifted down by 5 rows.
3. The smaller object is upscaled by a factor of 3 and shifted down by 6 rows and right by 7 columns. It is also recolored to '1'.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. The single '2' object in the input is split into two objects.
2. The larger object is upscaled by a factor of 2 and shifted down by 1 row and right by 1 column.
3. The smaller object (single cell) is upscaled by a factor of 3 and shifted down by 4 rows and right by 8 columns. It is also recolored to '1'.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

1. The input grid contains three '2' objects.
2. The largest object is upscaled by a factor of 2 and shifted right by 7 columns.
3. The medium-sized object is upscaled by a factor of 2, horizontally mirrored, and shifted down by 5 rows.
4. The smallest object (single cell) is upscaled by a factor of 3 and shifted down by 4 rows and right by 9 columns. It is also recolored to '1'. 


## Program Versions & Explanations:

**Note:**  The following programs assume there will always be at most three distinct objects in the input grid (excluding background '0').

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: size(obj))):
    if size(obj) == 1:
      obj = upscale(obj, 3)
      obj = shift(obj, (4 + i * 5, 7 + i))
      obj = recolor(1, obj)
    elif i == 0:
      obj = upscale(obj, 2)
      obj = shift(obj, (0, 5))
    elif i == 1:
      obj = upscale(obj, 2)
      obj = hmirror(obj)
      obj = shift(obj, (5, 0))
    else:
      obj = upscale(obj, 2)
      obj = shift(obj, (7, 0))
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identifies all objects in the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Sort Objects:** Sorts the objects based on their size using `sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: size(obj))`.
3. **Transform Objects:**  Iterates through each object and applies specific transformations based on their size and order:
    * **Smallest Object:** Upscales by 3, recolors to '1', and shifts based on its order.
    * **Largest Object:** Upscales by 2 and shifts down by 5 rows.
    * **Second Largest Object:** Upscales by 2, mirrors horizontally, and shifts right by 5 columns.
    * **Third Largest Object (If Present):** Upscales by 2 and shifts right by 7 columns.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paints each transformed object onto the output canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: -size(obj))):
    if i == 2:
      obj = upscale(obj, 3)
      obj = shift(obj, (9, 9))
      obj = recolor(1, obj)
    elif i == 0:
      obj = upscale(obj, 2)
      obj = shift(obj, (0, 5))
    elif i == 1:
      obj = upscale(obj, 2)
      obj = hmirror(obj)
      obj = shift(obj, (5, 0))
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to Version 1, but instead of identifying the smallest object by size, it assumes the smallest object will always be the third one encountered due to the sorting.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  s = sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: size(obj))
  a, b, c = s[0], s[1], s[2] if len(s) > 2 else None
  if c:
    c = upscale(c, 3)
    c = shift(c, (9, 9))
    c = recolor(1, c)
  a = upscale(a, 2)
  a = shift(a, (0, 5))
  b = upscale(b, 2)
  b = hmirror(b)
  b = shift(b, (5, 0))
  O = paint(O, a)
  O = paint(O, b)
  if c:
    O = paint(O, c)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version explicitly assigns the first three objects to variables `a`, `b`, and `c` for clarity. 
- It then applies the transformations directly to these variables before painting them onto the output canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: size(obj))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(upscale(objs[0], 2), (0, 5)))
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(upscale(objs[1], 2)), (5, 0)))
  if len(objs) > 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(shift(upscale(objs[2], 3), (9, 9)), 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version chains multiple functions together within a single line for each object transformation.
- This makes the code more concise but potentially less readable.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj, i):
    if i == 2:
      return recolor(shift(upscale(obj, 3), (9, 9)), 1)
    elif i == 1:
      return shift(hmirror(upscale(obj, 2)), (5, 0))
    else:
      return shift(upscale(obj, 2), (0, 5))
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: size(obj))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    O = paint(O, transform_object(obj, i))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines a helper function `transform_object` that encapsulates the transformation logic for each object based on its index.
- This improves code organization and readability, especially for more complex transformations.

These are just five examples; many other valid programs could achieve the same transformation using different DSL functions and logic.
