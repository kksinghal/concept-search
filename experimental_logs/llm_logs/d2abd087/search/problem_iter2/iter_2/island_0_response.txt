## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Duplication and Shift:** The input contains a single two-celled object (formed by '2's).  The output has two instances of this object. One is shifted diagonally down-right by two cells.
2. **New Object Creation:** A new three-celled object made of '1's is added to the bottom-left of the output grid. 
3. **Grid Expansion:**  The output grid is expanded to 10x10, with the transformed objects placed within a background of '0's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Object Duplication and Shift:**  The single two-celled object in the input is duplicated. One copy is enlarged horizontally to four cells and shifted one cell up and one cell right.
2. **New Object Creation:** Two new objects are created:
    *  A five-celled object of '1's, positioned at the bottom of the grid.
    *  A scattered arrangement of five '1's, mostly on the right side and top of the grid.
3. **Grid Expansion:** The output grid is expanded to 10x10.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

1. **Object Separation and Transformation:**  The input contains three objects. In the output:
    * One object is separated into two two-celled objects. 
    * The top-left object is transformed into a three-celled L-shaped object.
    * The bottom-right two-celled object is unchanged.
2. **New Object Creation:** Two new objects are created:
    *  A six-celled object of '1's, mostly positioned at the top of the grid.
    *  A four-celled object of '1's, at the bottom-left. 
3. **Grid Expansion:** The output grid is expanded to 10x10.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)  
  shifted_obj = shift(first(objs), (2, 2)) if objs else frozenset()
  new_ones_base = frozenset({(1, (7, 1)), (1, (8, 1)), (1, (8, 2))})
  new_ones = new_ones_base | {(1, (8, 3))} if len(objs) > 1 else new_ones_base
  output_objects = objs | {shifted_obj} | new_ones
  output_grid = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), output_objects)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

* **Object Extraction and Shift:** Extracts objects from the input grid, shifts one copy if available, and creates a base set for new '1' objects.
* **Conditional Object Addition:**  Adds an extra '1' to `new_ones` if there's more than one object in the input.
* **Combine and Paint:** Combines all objects and paints them onto a 10x10 canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  main_obj = argmax(objects(grid, True, False, True), size)
  shifted_main = shift(main_obj, (2, 2)) if main_obj else frozenset()
  new_ones_base = frozenset((1, add((7, 1), ulcorner(main_obj))), (1, add((8, 1), ulcorner(main_obj))))
  new_ones = new_ones_base | {
      (1, add((8, 2), ulcorner(main_obj))), 
      (1, add((8, 3), ulcorner(main_obj)))
  } if len(objects(grid, True, False, True)) > 1 else new_ones_base
  output_objects = {main_obj, shifted_main} | new_ones
  return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), output_objects)
```

**Explanation:**

* **Find Largest Object:** Finds the largest object in the input.
* **Shift and New Objects:** Shifts the largest object and creates new '1' objects relative to its upper-left corner.
* **Conditional Object Addition:** Similar to version 1, adds extra '1's based on the number of input objects. 
* **Combine and Paint:** Combines objects and paints them on the canvas. 

**Program Version 3:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  shifted = mapply(lambda o: shift(o, (2, 2)), objs)
  top_obj = argmax(objs, lambda o: uppermost(o))
  corner = ulcorner(top_obj) if top_obj else (0, 0)
  new_ones = {(1, add(corner, (7, 1))), (1, add(corner, (8, 1))), (1, add(corner, (8, 2)))}
  if len(objs) > 1:
    new_ones.add((1, add(corner, (8, 3))))
  return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), objs | shifted | frozenset(new_ones))
```

**Explanation:**

* **Extract, Shift, and Find Top:**  Extracts objects, shifts them using `mapply`, and finds the topmost object.
* **New Objects Relative to Top:** Creates new '1' objects relative to the top object's upper-left corner.
* **Conditional Addition and Painting:**  Adds an extra '1' based on object count and then paints everything on the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  canvas_grid = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
      canvas_grid = paint(canvas_grid, obj)
      canvas_grid = paint(canvas_grid, shift(obj, (2, 2))) 
  new_ones_base = {(1, (7, 1)), (1, (8, 1)), (1, (8, 2))}
  new_ones = new_ones_base | {(1, (8, 3))} if len(objects(grid, True, False, True)) > 1 else new_ones_base
  return paint(canvas_grid, new_ones)
```

**Explanation:**

* **Iterative Painting:** Iterates through each object in the input and paints both the original and a shifted copy onto the canvas.
* **Add New Objects:** Paints the new '1' objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  if objs:
    obj = first(objs)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (2,2))
    output = paint(canvas(0, (10,10)), obj)
    output = paint(output, shifted_obj) 
  else:
    output = canvas(0, (10,10))
  new_ones = {(1, (7,1)), (1, (8,1)), (1, (8,2))}
  if len(objs) > 1: 
      new_ones.add((1, (8,3)))
  return paint(output, new_ones)
```

**Explanation:**

* **Handle Empty Input:** Checks if there are any objects in the input. If not, it returns an empty canvas.
* **Process First Object:** Processes the first object found, shifting and painting it onto the canvas.
* **Add Conditional '1's:** Similar to previous versions, it adds an extra '1' object based on the object count in the input.


These five program versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the same set of transformations, demonstrating flexibility in using the provided DSL.
