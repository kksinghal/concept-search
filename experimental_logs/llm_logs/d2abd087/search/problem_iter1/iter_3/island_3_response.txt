## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve the following steps for each object:

1. **Splitting:** Objects are split vertically based on their color. If the object has an even number of columns, the split is exactly in half. If the object has an odd number of columns, the left part of the split gets the extra column.
2. **Recoloring:** The left part of the split object is recolored to '1', and the right part is recolored to '2'.
3. **Placement:** The recolored parts retain their original vertical positioning but are shifted horizontally. The left part is moved as far left as possible within the object's original bounding box. The right part is moved as far right as possible within the object's original bounding box.

**Let's analyze each example to confirm this pattern:**

* **Input_0:** The single 5-object is split into a left '1' part and a right '2' part. Both parts maintain their vertical positions but are pushed to the extreme left and right respectively within the object's bounding box.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, each 5-object is split and recolored. The parts are then shifted to the edges of their original bounding boxes.
* **Input_2:** This example further confirms the pattern. Each object is split and recolored. Interestingly, the split of the larger object results in a single-column '1' part and a wider '2' part, both positioned at the extremes of the original bounding box.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions that aim to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    split_point = width(obj) // 2
    left_part = frozenset((1, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < leftmost(obj) + split_point)
    right_part = frozenset((2, (i, j + width(obj) - size(right_part))) for v, (i, j) in obj if j >= leftmost(obj) + split_point)
    O = paint(O, left_part)
    O = paint(O, right_part)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **Splitting:**  Calculates the splitting point for the object based on its width. 
4. **Recoloring and Shifting:** Creates `left_part` and `right_part` sets with colors '1' and '2' respectively. Shifts the `right_part` horizontally to the extreme right within the bounding box using its width.
5. **Painting:** Paints the `left_part` and `right_part` onto the canvas.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      row_start = (uppermost(obj) + i, leftmost(obj))
      left_width = width(obj) // 2 + (width(obj) % 2 if i == 0 else 0)
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, crop(I, row_start, (1, left_width))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, crop(I, (row_start[0], row_start[1] + left_width), (1, width(obj) - left_width))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each object in the input grid and each row of the object.
3. **Splitting:**  Calculates the width of the left part, giving the extra column to the first row if the width is odd.
4. **Recoloring and Painting:** Extracts the left and right parts as subgrids using `crop`, recolors them to '1' and '2', and paints them onto the canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    left_indices = frozenset((i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)
    right_indices = toindices(obj) - left_indices
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, toobject(left_indices, I)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(toobject(right_indices, I), (0, width(obj) - size(right_indices)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **Splitting:** Calculates the indices for the left and right parts.
4. **Recoloring and Shifting:** Creates objects from the left and right indices using `toobject`. Recolors them to '1' and '2'. Shifts the right object to the rightmost position.
5. **Painting:** Paints the recolored and shifted objects onto the canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    w = width(obj)
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, leftmost(obj) + j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < w // 2})
    O = paint(O, {(2, (i, leftmost(obj) + w - w // 2 + j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j >= w // 2})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **Splitting and Shifting:**  Directly creates sets of cells for the left and right parts with colors '1' and '2', calculating their horizontal positions while iterating.
4. **Painting:** Paints the sets of cells onto the canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    w = width(obj) // 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, toobject(frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < leftmost(obj) + w), I)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, toobject(frozenset((i, j + w + (width(obj) % 2)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j >= leftmost(obj) + w), I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **Splitting and Shifting:** Calculates the splitting point and directly creates objects for the left and right parts by filtering indices, recoloring them, and shifting the right part while accounting for odd widths.
4. **Painting:** Paints the objects onto the canvas.

Each version utilizes different combinations of functions and logic to achieve the desired outcome. This provides diverse solutions while adhering to the provided DSL.
