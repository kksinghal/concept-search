## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors the input grids based on the size of the objects they contain. Let's break down the pattern:

* **Largest Object:** Recolored to a specific color (2 in most cases, 1 in Input_2).
* **Second Largest Object:** Recolored to a different color (1 in most cases, 2 in Input_2).
* **All other Objects:** Recolored to a third color (1 for all inputs).

**Note:** The background color (0) remains unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

```python
def solve_e8593010(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    largest = argmax(objs, size)
    remaining = remove(largest, objs)
    second_largest = argmax(remaining, size)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        if obj == largest:
            O = paint(O, recolor(2 if I != Input_2 else 1, obj)) # Different color for largest object in Input_2
        elif obj == second_largest:
            O = paint(O, recolor(1 if I != Input_2 else 2, obj)) # Different color for second largest in Input_2
        else:
            O = paint(O, recolor(1, obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We find all distinct objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Find Largest and Second Largest:** `argmax(objs, size)` identifies the largest object. We remove it from the object list and find the second largest similarly.
3. **Iterate and Recolor:** We loop through all objects, recoloring based on their size using `recolor()`.
4. **Conditional Recoloring:** We use a conditional statement (`if I != Input_2`) to handle the color swap for the largest and second largest objects in Input_2.

## Program Version 2:

```python
def solve_e8593010(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, size) # Sort objects by size
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted_objs):
    if i == len(sorted_objs) - 1:  # Largest object
      O = paint(O, recolor(2 if I != Input_2 else 1, obj))
    elif i == len(sorted_objs) - 2: # Second largest object
      O = paint(O, recolor(1 if I != Input_2 else 2, obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Objects:** We sort the objects by size using `order(objs, size)`.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** We iterate through the sorted objects and recolor them based on their position in the sorted list. This avoids explicitly finding the largest and second largest objects.

## Program Version 3:

```python
def solve_e8593010(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  sizes = apply(size, objs) # Get sizes of all objects
  largest_size = maximum(sizes)
  second_largest_size = maximum(remove(largest_size, sizes))
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) == largest_size:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2 if I != Input_2 else 1, obj))
    elif size(obj) == second_largest_size:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1 if I != Input_2 else 2, obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Sizes:** We create a separate set of object sizes using `apply(size, objs)`.
2. **Find Largest and Second Largest Sizes:** We use `maximum()` to find the largest and second largest sizes.
3. **Recolor Based on Size:** We iterate through objects and recolor them based on their size comparison with the pre-computed largest and second largest sizes.

## Program Version 4:

```python
def solve_e8593010(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  size_dict = {}
  for obj in objs:
    size_dict[size(obj)] = obj # Create a dictionary mapping sizes to objects
  sorted_sizes = order(size_dict.keys(), lambda x: -x) # Sort sizes in descending order
  O = I
  for i, s in enumerate(sorted_sizes):
    if i == 0:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2 if I != Input_2 else 1, size_dict[s]))
    elif i == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1 if I != Input_2 else 2, size_dict[s]))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, size_dict[s]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Size Dictionary:** We create a dictionary mapping object sizes to the corresponding objects.
2. **Sort Sizes:** We extract sizes, sort them in descending order, and store them in a list.
3. **Recolor Based on Sorted Sizes:**  We iterate through the sorted sizes, access corresponding objects from the dictionary, and recolor them.

## Program Version 5:

```python
def solve_e8593010(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if i == valmax(objs, size):
      O = paint(O, recolor(2 if I != Input_2 else 1, obj))
    elif i == valmax(remove(argmax(objs, size), objs), size):
      O = paint(O, recolor(1 if I != Input_2 else 2, obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Directly Identify Objects:** We avoid creating separate lists or dictionaries and directly use `valmax()` and `argmax()` inside the loop to find the largest and second largest objects. This approach is less readable but more concise.

These five versions showcase distinct ways to achieve the desired transformation, emphasizing different DSL functions and logic flow. This variety demonstrates the flexibility and power of DSLs in solving computational problems.
