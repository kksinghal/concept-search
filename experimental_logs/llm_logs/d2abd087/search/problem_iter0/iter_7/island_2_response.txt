## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves the following steps:

1. **Downscaling:** The input grid is downscaled by a factor of 3, effectively summarizing the information within 3x3 blocks of the original grid.
2. **Color Remapping:**  
    * Cells corresponding to the object with color '5' in the original grid are assigned color '2' in the output grid.
    * Cells corresponding to objects other than the background (most common color) and '5' in the original grid are assigned color '1' in the output grid.
    * Background cells in the original grid remain as background in the output grid.

**Example (Input_0 to Output_0):**

- The 3x3 block at the top left corner of Input_0 contains only '0's, so it becomes a '0' in the output grid.
- The 3x3 block in the middle of Input_0 contains the '5' object, so it becomes a '2' in the output grid.
- The 3x3 block containing a portion of the '5' object in the bottom left corner of Input_0 becomes a '1' in the output grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I) // (3, 3)) # Create canvas with correct dimensions
  for i in range(0, len(I), 3):
    for j in range(0, len(I[0]), 3):
      block = crop(I, (i, j), (3, 3))
      if any(5 in row for row in block):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i // 3, j // 3)}) # Fill with 2 if '5' present
      elif any(v != 0 for row in block for v in row):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i // 3, j // 3)}) # Fill with 1 if non-zero, non-'5' present
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A canvas of the correct size (downscaled by 3) is created, filled with '0's.
2. **Block Iteration:** The code iterates through the input grid in 3x3 blocks.
3. **Block Analysis:** For each block:
    * It checks for the presence of '5'. If found, the corresponding cell in the output grid is filled with '2'.
    * If '5' is not found, it checks for any non-zero value, indicating a non-background object. If found, the corresponding cell is filled with '1'.
4. **Output:** The filled canvas, representing the transformed grid, is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if any(5 in crop(I, (i * 3, j * 3), (3, 3)) for i in range(i, min(i + 3, len(I)))) else
          1 if any(v != 0 for i in range(i, min(i + 3, len(I))) 
                   for j in range(j, min(j + 3, len(I[0]))) 
                   for v in crop(I, (i, j), (1, 1))[0]) else 0
          for j in range(0, len(I[0]), 3)
      )
      for i in range(0, len(I), 3)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Loops & Conditional Expression:** The code uses nested loops and a conditional expression within a tuple comprehension to achieve the transformation in a more compact form.
2. **Block Summarization:** For each 3x3 block, the expression checks for:
    * Presence of '5': If found, the corresponding cell in the output is assigned '2'.
    * Presence of non-zero, non-'5' values: If found, the cell is assigned '1'.
    * Otherwise, the cell remains '0'.
3. **Output:** The generated tuple represents the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_block(block):
    if colorcount(block, 5) > 0:
      return 2
    elif numcolors(block) > 1:
      return 1
    else:
      return 0
  blocks =  prapply(lambda i, j: crop(I, (i * 3, j * 3), (3, 3)), 
                      interval(0, len(I) // 3, 1), interval(0, len(I[0]) // 3, 1))
  return tuple(tuple(process_block(block) for block in row) 
               for row in (totuple(blocks)[i:i+len(I) // 3] for i in range(0, len(totuple(blocks)), len(I) // 3)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_block` Function:**  This function encapsulates the logic for analyzing each 3x3 block. It uses `colorcount` to check for the presence of '5' and `numcolors` to determine if there are objects other than the background.
2. **Block Processing:** The `prapply` function generates all 3x3 blocks, which are then analyzed using `process_block`.
3. **Output:** The results are assembled into a tuple representing the transformed grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (len(I) // 3, len(I[0]) // 3))
  for i in range(0, len(I) // 3):
    for j in range(0, len(I[0]) // 3):
      block = crop(I, (i * 3, j * 3), (3, 3))
      if colorcount(block, 5) > 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
      elif any(v != mostcolor(block) for row in block for v in row):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Iteration:** Similar to version 1, a canvas is created, and the code iterates through 3x3 blocks.
2. **Block Check:**  Instead of checking for '5' directly, this version uses `colorcount` for more flexibility. It also compares values within the block to the `mostcolor` to identify non-background objects.
3. **Output:** The transformed grid is returned as a tuple.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_cell(i, j):
    block = crop(I, (i * 3, j * 3), (3, 3))
    return (2 if colorcount(block, 5) > 0 else 
            1 if numcolors(block) > 1 else 0)
  return tuple(
      tuple(transform_cell(i, j) for j in range(len(I[0]) // 3))
      for i in range(len(I) // 3)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`transform_cell` Function:** This function determines the output value for a specific cell in the downscaled grid based on its corresponding 3x3 block in the input.
2. **Cell-wise Transformation:** Nested loops iterate through the downscaled grid dimensions, calling `transform_cell` to determine the value for each cell.
3. **Output:**  The result is assembled into a tuple representing the transformed grid.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation using various DSL functions and programming constructs, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
