## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves inserting the digit '2' to the right of every '1' in the input grid, provided the cell to the right is empty (contains a '0').

**Input_0:**

- The '1's at (0, 0), (3, 1), and (3, 3) have a '0' to their right and are transformed into '1 2'. 
- The other '1's remain unchanged.

**Input_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, all '1's with a '0' to their right are transformed into '1 2'.

**Input_2:**

- The transformation logic remains consistent, with '1 0' sequences being replaced by '1 2'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if j > 0 and row[j-1] == ONE and v == ZERO else v
            for j, v in enumerate(r)
        )
        for r in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each row (`r`) and cell value (`v`) in the input grid (`I`).
- For each cell, it checks if the previous cell contains '1' and the current cell contains '0'.
- If true, it replaces the current cell with '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        TWO if papply(lambda x, y: y == ONE and x == ZERO, r[1:], r[:-1])[j] else v
        for j, v in enumerate(r[:-1])
      ) + (r[-1],)
      for r in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses `papply` to compare each cell with its right neighbor.
- Constructs a new tuple for each row, replacing '0's with '2's where the condition is met.
- Appends the last element of the original row to the new tuple to maintain grid dimensions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            branch(j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == ONE and row[j + 1] == ZERO, TWO, val)
            for j, val in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

- Utilizes the `branch` function for conditional replacement.
- Iterates through each cell, checking if it's a '0' preceded by a '1'.
- Replaces the '0' with '2' if the condition is met; otherwise, keeps the original value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        hconcat(
            tuple((TWO if v == ZERO and j > 0 and r[j - 1] == ONE else v,) for j, v in enumerate(r)),
            (),
        )
        for r in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

- Employs `hconcat` to construct each row after applying the transformation.
- Iterates through each cell, checking for the '1 0' pattern.
- Replaces the '0' with '2' if the pattern is found; otherwise, retains the original value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            v if (j == len(r) - 1 or v != ZERO or r[j + 1] != ONE) else TWO 
            for j, v in enumerate(r)
        )
        for r in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly iterates and checks for the condition where replacement should NOT happen (current cell is not '0', or the next cell is not '1', or it's the last cell).
- If the condition for no replacement is not met, it implies that replacement should occur, and hence replaces the current cell with '2'.
- This approach simplifies the logic by focusing on the negative condition.


These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic structures.
