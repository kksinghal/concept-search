## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation adds a '2' to the right of every '1' in the input grid if the right cell is empty (contains a '0').

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

Output:
```
1 2 1
0 1 2
```

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if j < len(row) - 1 and cell == ONE and row[j + 1] == ZERO else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly iterates through each cell in the input grid. 
- It checks if the current cell contains a '1' and if the cell to its right exists and contains a '0'. 
- If both conditions are met, it replaces the current cell with a '2'. 
- Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if (i, j + 1) in asindices(I) and I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `asindices` function to get all valid indices of the grid. 
- It iterates through each index and checks if a right neighbor exists within the grid boundaries. 
- If a right neighbor exists and the current cell is '1' while the neighbor is '0', it replaces the current cell with '2'. 
- Otherwise, it retains the original cell value.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right = shift(fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ONE, asindices(I)), RIGHT)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if I[i][j] == ONE and shifted_right[i][j] == ONE else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a shifted copy of the input grid. 
- It creates a canvas of zeros with the same shape as the input, fills it with '1' at the input indices, and then shifts this new grid one step to the right.
-  It compares the original grid with the shifted one. If both grids have '1' at the same index, it means the original grid had a '1' followed by a '0' to its right.
- In such cases, it replaces the current cell with '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, cell in enumerate(row):
      if j < len(row) - 1 and cell == ONE and row[j + 1] == ZERO:
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell, similar to Version 1.
- However, instead of directly modifying the input grid, it creates a copy (O).
- It then iterates through the copy and applies the '2' replacement logic as described in Version 1.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if any(I[i][k] == ONE and k == j + 1 for k in range(len(row))) else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested loops and the `any` function to find '1's followed by '0's.
- For each cell, it iterates through its row again, checking if there exists a '1' followed by a '0' at the current cell's index + 1.
- If such a pattern is found, it replaces the current cell with '2'; otherwise, it retains the original value.
