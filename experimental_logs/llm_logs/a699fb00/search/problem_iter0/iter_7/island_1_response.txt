## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background digit, which is most frequent) and extending them to the right by one cell, but only if the cell to the right is part of the background.

**Input 0:**

* Two objects are identified: {(1,(0,0)), (1,(0,2))}, {(1,(3,1)), (1,(3,3))}
* For each object, the rightmost cell of each row is extended rightward with a '2'.

**Input 1 & 2:**

* The same logic applies. Objects are identified, and their rightmost cells are extended rightward with a '2', only if the cell to the right is background. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
      if j < w - 1 and I[i][j+1] == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid `I`. 
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each object `obj` and its cells. For each cell, it checks if it's not on the rightmost edge (`j < w - 1`) and if the cell to the right is the background color (`I[i][j+1] == mostcolor(I)`). If both conditions hold, it fills the cell to the right with '2' (`O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != mostcolor(I) and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** This version iterates directly through the grid cells instead of identifying objects.
2. **Check and Extend:** For each cell, it checks if it's not a background color (`v != mostcolor(I)`), not on the rightmost edge (`j < len(row) - 1`), and if the cell to the right is background (`row[j+1] == mostcolor(I)`).  If true, it fills the cell to the right with '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == mostcolor(I) and v != mostcolor(I) else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation in a more concise way. It iterates through each cell and applies the extension logic within the list comprehension.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        O = paint(O, combine(obj, recolor(2, shift(rightmost(obj), RIGHT))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an empty grid filled with the background color.
2. **Paint and Extend:** It then iterates through each object, shifts its rightmost point to the right by one, recolors the shifted point to '2', combines it with the original object, and paints this extended object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    extensions = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(2, sfilter(toindices(shift(obj, RIGHT)), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == mostcolor(I))), objs)
    return paint(cover(I, merge(objs)), merge(objs, extensions))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Extensions:** This version first identifies objects. Then, for each object, it calculates the indices of cells to the right, filters for cells that are background, recolors them to '2', and stores these extensions.
2. **Paint the Result:** Finally, it covers the original objects on the grid, merges the original objects with their extensions, and paints them back onto the grid.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
