## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation modifies the input grid by adding a '2' to the right of each '1' if that position is currently a '0'. 

**Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:**
    * The '1's at (0, 0), (0, 2), and (3, 3) all get a '2' added to their right because the positions (0, 1), (0, 3), and (3, 4) are initially '0'.
    * The '1' at (3, 1) remains unchanged because the position (3, 2) is already occupied by a '1'.

* **Input_1 and Input_2:**
    *  The same logic applies, resulting in '2's being added to the right of applicable '1's, effectively extending the horizontal presence of the '1' objects.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) for v, loc in obj if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT))==ZERO))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** Identifies all objects formed by connected '1's in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`(TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for obj in ... for v, loc in obj if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT))==ZERO`:** Iterates through each cell of each object. If the cell to the right is '0', it creates a new cell with value '2' at that location.
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the new '2' cells onto the original input grid `I`, effectively performing the extension.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return underfill(I, TWO, frozenset(add(loc, RIGHT) for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) for v, loc in obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:**  Identifies all objects (connected '1's) on the grid.
2. **`add(loc, RIGHT) for obj in ... for v, loc in obj`:**  Calculates the indices directly to the right of each cell belonging to the objects.
3. **`underfill(I, TWO, ...)`:**  Fills the calculated indices with the value '2' only if they are currently the background color (most common color, which is assumed to be '0').

### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for v, loc in obj:
      if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO:
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(loc, RIGHT))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** Identifies all objects formed by '1's.
2.  **Loop:** Iterates through each object and its cells.
3.  **`if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO`:** Checks if the cell to the right of the current cell is '0'.
4.  **`O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(loc, RIGHT))})`:** If the condition is met, it paints a '2' to the right of the current cell on the output grid `O`.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  return cellwise(I, shifted_grid, fallback=ZERO)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)`:**  Creates a shifted version of the input grid where all elements are moved one position to the right.
2.  **`cellwise(I, shifted_grid, fallback=ZERO)`:**  Compares the original grid with the shifted grid. If a cell and its right neighbor in the original grid have the same value, that value is kept. Otherwise, the fallback value ('0') is used. This effectively replicates the 'extension' of '1' objects where possible.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) for v, loc in obj if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO and add(loc, RIGHT) not in toindices(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(...)`:**  Identifies objects (connected '1's) twice - once with the background excluded and once with the background included.
2. **`(TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) ... if ...`:**  Iterates through object cells and checks if the cell to the right is '0' and does not belong to any object (including background). If true, creates a new cell with '2' at that location. 
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the new '2' cells onto the input grid. 


Each of these programs implements the described transformation using different approaches and combinations of DSL functions. You can choose the one that best suits your needs or preferences.
