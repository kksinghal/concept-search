## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid and placing the digit '2' to the right of each '1'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

**Output_0:**

```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

* Each '1' in the input grid now has a '2' to its immediate right in the output grid. 

**Input_1 & Output_1 / Input_2 & Output_2:**

*  The same transformation applies to these input-output pairs. Every '1' in the input grid now has a '2' to its right in the output grid. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") using the DSL provided in `dsl.py`:

**Version 1:** Using `ofcolor`, `shift`, and `paint`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Finds all occurrences of 1 and paints a 2 to the right.
  """
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1) 
  twos = shift(ones, RIGHT)  
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, twos)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** This line identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that contain the value '1'.
2. **`twos = shift(ones, RIGHT)`:** This line shifts all the indices in `ones` one position to the right, effectively identifying the locations where '2' should be painted.
3. **`O = paint(I, recolor(2, twos))`:** This line first recolors the indices in `twos` to the value '2'. Then, it paints these recolored indices onto the original input grid `I` to produce the output grid `O`.

**Version 2:** Using nested loops and `fill`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through the grid and fills a 2 to the right of each 1.
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})  # Copy current cell
      if j < w - 1 and I[i][j] == 1:  # Check for 1 and right boundary
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`O = canvas(0, (h, w))`:** Creates an empty output grid of the same size as the input.
3. **Loop:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
4. **`O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})`:** Copies the value of the current cell in the input grid to the output grid.
5. **`if j < w - 1 and I[i][j] == 1:`:**  Checks if the current cell contains '1' and if it's not on the rightmost boundary of the grid.
6. **`O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)})`:** If the conditions are met, it fills a '2' in the cell to the right of the current cell in the output grid.

**Version 3:** Using list comprehension and `zip`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses list comprehension and zip to efficiently place 2s.
  """
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and k == j + 1 else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row) for k in range(len(row))
      )
      for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List comprehension:** This version uses nested list comprehensions to iterate over the grid and modify the values.
2. **`2 if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and k == j + 1 else v`:** This condition checks if we're at a '1' and if we're at the position immediately to the right of it. If so, it inserts a '2', otherwise it keeps the original value `v`. 

**Version 4:** Using `apply` and lambda function

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Applies a lambda function to each row to place the 2s.
  """
  O = apply(
      lambda row: tuple(2 if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and k == j + 1 else v for j, v in enumerate(row) for k in range(len(row))),
      I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`apply` and `lambda`:** This version utilizes the `apply` function to apply a lambda function to each row of the input grid.
2. The lambda function contains the same logic as the conditional statement in Version 3, checking for a '1' and placing a '2' to its right.

**Version 5:** Using recursion and `hconcat`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recursively processes the grid to place the 2s.
  """
  h = len(I)
  if h == 0: 
    return I
  head, *tail = I  
  modified_head = tuple(2 if j < len(head) - 1 and head[j] == 1 else head[j] for j in range(len(head)))
  return hconcat((modified_head,), Program_to_be_generated(tuple(tail)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recursion:** This version employs recursion to process each row of the grid.
2. **Base Case:** If the grid is empty (`h == 0`), it returns the empty grid.
3. **Recursive Step:**  
    *  It separates the first row (`head`) and the remaining rows (`tail`).
    * It processes the `head` to place '2' to the right of every '1'.
    *  It recursively calls the function with the `tail` and horizontally concatenates the result with the modified `head` using `hconcat`.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version offers a different way of thinking about and manipulating the grid data to produce the correct output.
