## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying '1's in the input grid that have a '0' immediately to their right. For each such '1', the '0' to its right is replaced with a '2'. 

Let's illustrate with an example from Input_1:

```
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0  
```

This row becomes:

```
0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 0 0
```

The '0's following the first, third, fifth, and seventh '1's are replaced with '2's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == ONE and row[j + 1] == ZERO else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row and cell of the input grid. For each cell, it checks if the cell contains a '1' and if there's a '0' to its right. If these conditions are met, it replaces the cell's value with '2'; otherwise, it retains the original value.

**Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if (i, j + 1) in asindices(I) and I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested loops to iterate through the grid's rows and columns. It checks for '1's with a right neighbor of '0' within the grid boundaries and replaces the '0' with '2' while preserving other values.

**Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  shifted_right = shift(fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ONE, asindices(I)), RIGHT)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if cell == ONE and j + 1 < len(row) and shifted_right[i][j + 1] == ONE else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version creates a shifted copy of the input grid where '1's are moved one position to the right. It then compares each cell in the original grid with its counterpart in the shifted grid. If both cells contain '1', it replaces the original cell's value with '2'.

**Version 4** 

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j] == ONE and (i, j + 1) in ofcolor(I, ZERO) else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the indices of all '0's in the grid. Then, it iterates through the grid, and for each '1', it checks if its right neighbor index corresponds to a '0' index. If it does, the '1's right neighbor is replaced by '2'.

**Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  return fill(I, TWO, 
              frozenset(
                  (i, j + 1) 
                  for i, j in ones
                  if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (i, j + 1) in ofcolor(I, ZERO)
              )
             )
```

**Explanation:**

This version first gets the indices of all '1's. Then, for each '1', it checks if it has a valid right neighbour and if that neighbour is a '0'. If both conditions are met, the index of the neighbour is added to a set. Finally, the grid is filled with '2' at the indices from the set.
