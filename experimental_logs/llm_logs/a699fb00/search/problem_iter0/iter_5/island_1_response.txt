## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves changing the color of specific cells in the input grid. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* For each cell with value '1', if there's a '1' to its left, change the cell value to '2'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* Similar to Input_0, but applied to all occurrences of '1' with a '1' to their left.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* Again, similar to Input_0, reinforcing the pattern of changing '1' to '2' if it has a '1' to its left.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, LEFT) for obj in objs)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if any(index(I, (i, j) + offset) == v for offset in {LEFT}):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  It identifies objects (connected components of '1's) in the input grid.
2. **Shift Left:** It creates a shifted version of each object, moved one position to the left.
3. **Check for Overlap:**  For each cell in the original objects, it checks if the shifted object occupies the cell to its left.
4. **Conditional Fill:** If there's an overlap (meaning a '1' was to the left), the cell is filled with '2'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), LEFT)
  O = I
  for v, (i, j) in shifted:
    if index(I, (i, j)) == 1:
      O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid Left:**  Shifts the entire input grid one position to the left.
2. **Iterate and Compare:** Iterates through the shifted grid. For each cell with value '1', it checks the corresponding cell in the original grid.
3. **Conditional Fill:** If the original cell also contains '1', indicating the original '1' had a '1' to its left, the cell in the output grid is filled with '2'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
      else:
        O = fill(O, val, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  Creates an empty grid (canvas) of the same size as the input, filled with '0's.
2. **Iterate and Check:** It iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Conditional Fill:** If a cell has '1' and its left neighbor also has '1', it fills the corresponding cell in the canvas with '2'. Otherwise, it fills it with the original cell value.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if index(I, (i, j)) == 1 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 1:
      O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:**  It works directly on the input grid, modifying it to produce the output.
2. **Iterate and Check:**  Iterates through each cell's index.
3. **Conditional Fill:**  If a cell and its left neighbor both contain '1', the cell's value is changed to '2'.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if val == 1 and j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1 else val
            for j, val in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested List Comprehension:**  It uses nested list comprehension for a concise solution.
2. **Iterate and Transform:**  Iterates through each cell, transforming its value based on the condition.
3. **Conditional Value:**  If a cell is '1' and its left neighbor is also '1', it's transformed to '2', otherwise, it keeps its original value.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL and the potential for creative problem-solving.
