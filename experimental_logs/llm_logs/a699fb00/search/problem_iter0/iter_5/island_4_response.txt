## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to follow this rule:

**For every '1' in the input grid:**

* **If** it has a '0' immediately to its right,
* **Then** replace that '0' with a '2'.

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The '1' at (0, 0) has a '0' to its right, so the '0' at (0, 1) is replaced with '2'.
* The '1' at (0, 2) has a '0' to its right, so the '0' at (0, 3) is replaced with '2'.
* The '1' at (3, 1) has a '0' to its right, so the '0' at (3, 2) is replaced with '2'.

**Input_1 and Input_2:**

* The same logic applies to these inputs, resulting in the observed outputs.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_B, using cellwise iteration)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid with zeros
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            O = fill(O, val, (i, j))  # Copy original value
            if val == ONE and j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO:
                O = fill(O, TWO, (i, j + 1))  # Fill right neighbor with '2'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Create an empty output grid `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate:** Go through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. **Copy:** Copy the value of the current cell from `I` to the corresponding cell in `O`.
4. **Check for Condition:** If the current cell in `I` is a '1' and it has a right neighbor within the grid bounds, and the right neighbor is a '0', proceed.
5. **Fill with '2':** Fill the right neighbor cell in `O` with the value '2'.
6. **Return:** Return the transformed grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by Program_B, using `ofcolor` and `apply`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Find all '1' cells
  potential_twos = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)  # Get potential '2' locations
  valid_twos = sfilter(potential_twos, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))  # Keep valid locations
  O = I  # Start with the original grid
  for i, j in valid_twos:
    O = fill(O, TWO, ((i, j),))  # Fill valid '2' locations
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** Locate all cells in the input grid `I` containing the value '1' using `ofcolor` and store them in the set `ones`.
2. **Potential '2's:** Generate a set `potential_twos` by shifting each location in `ones` one position to the right. These are the potential locations for '2'.
3. **Validate:** Filter `potential_twos` to keep only valid locations within the grid boundaries, storing the result in `valid_twos`.
4. **Fill '2's:** Iterate through `valid_twos` and for each valid location, fill the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` (which is initialized as a copy of `I`) with the value '2'.
5. **Return:** Return the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:** (Inspired by Program_B, using functional programming and `papply`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(branch(j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == ZERO and v == ONE, TWO, v) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate:** The code directly iterates through each row and each cell within the row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Conditional Replacement:**  For each cell, it checks if the following conditions are met:
    * `j < len(row) - 1`: Ensures the current cell is not the last one in the row.
    * `row[j + 1] == ZERO`: Checks if the cell to the right is '0'.
    * `v == ONE`: Checks if the current cell value is '1'.
    * If all three conditions are true, it replaces the current cell value with '2' (`TWO`) using the `branch` function; otherwise, it keeps the original cell value (`v`).
3. **Return:** It returns the transformed grid.


**Program Version 4:** (Inspired by Program_B, using `hconcat` and list comprehension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(hconcat((tuple(v if j == len(row)-1 or row[j+1] != ZERO else branch(v == ONE, TWO, v) for j, v in enumerate(row[:-1])),), ((row[-1],),)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** Iterates through each row in the input grid `I`.
2. **Process Row (Except Last Element):** For each row, it processes all elements except the last one.
    *  `v if j == len(row)-1 or row[j+1] != ZERO else branch(v == ONE, TWO, v)`: This part applies the transformation logic. 
        * If the current element is the last one in the row (`j == len(row)-1`) or the next element is not zero (`row[j+1] != ZERO`), it keeps the original value (`v`).
        * Otherwise, if the current value is '1', it replaces it with '2' (`TWO`); otherwise, it keeps the original value (`v`). 
3. **Concatenate:** It horizontally concatenates the processed part of the row with the last element of the row (`(row[-1],)`).
4. **Return:** It returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 5:** (Inspired by Program_B, using `apply` and conditional logic)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return apply(lambda row: apply(lambda j: branch(j < len(row)-1 and row[j] == ONE and row[j+1] == ZERO, (row[:j] + (ONE, TWO) + row[j+2:],), (row,)), range(len(row))), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** Uses `apply` to apply a lambda function to each row in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Cells in Row:** For each row, it uses another `apply` to iterate over the indices (`j`) of elements in the row.
3. **Conditional Modification:** For each cell index `j`, it checks:
    * `j < len(row)-1`: Makes sure there's an element to the right.
    * `row[j] == ONE and row[j+1] == ZERO`: Checks if the current element is '1' and the next is '0'.
    * If both conditions are true, it modifies the row by replacing the current element and the next with '1' and '2' respectively. Otherwise, it keeps the original row.
4. **Return:**  It returns the transformed grid.
