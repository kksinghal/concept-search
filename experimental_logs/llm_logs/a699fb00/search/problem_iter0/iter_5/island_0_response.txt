## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a pixel to the right of each '1' pixel in the input grid, but only if that pixel is a '0'. The new pixel is assigned the value '2'.

**Input_0 Example:**

- The '1' at (0, 0) gets a '2' added to its right, becoming (0, 1).
- The '1' at (0, 2) gets a '2' added to its right, becoming (0, 3).
- The '1' at (3, 1) gets a '2' added to its right, becoming (3, 2).
- The '1' at (3, 3) gets a '2' added to its right, becoming (3, 4).

**Input_1 and Input_2 Examples:** 
Follow the same pattern.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = paint(I, frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for obj in objs for v, loc in obj if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` finds all connected groups of '1's in the input grid.
2. **Add '2' to the Right:** For each cell in each '1' object, if the cell to the right is '0', we add a new cell with value '2' to the right of the current cell.
3. **Paint to Output:**  The `paint` function applies these new '2' cells onto a copy of the input grid, resulting in the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_grid, fallback=ZERO)
  O = replace(O, ONE, TWO)
  return asobject(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Right:** We shift the entire input grid one position to the right. 
2. **Cellwise Comparison:**  We compare the original grid with the shifted grid. If a cell in the original grid is '1' and the corresponding cell in the shifted grid is also '1', it means there was a '1' to its right. In this case, the `cellwise` function keeps the original value, which will be replaced with '2' in the next step. Otherwise, it uses the fallback value of '0'.
3. **Replace with '2':** All remaining '1's from the `cellwise` operation are replaced with '2'.
4. **Return as Object:** The final grid is returned as an object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j+1] == ZERO:
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j+1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid (except the last column).
2. **Conditional Paint:** If a cell is '1' and the cell to its right is '0', it paints a '2' on the cell to the right.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  condition = lambda v, loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO if loc[1] < width(I) - 1 else False
  new_cells = frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for v, loc in asobject(I) if v == ONE and condition(v, loc))
  O = paint(I, new_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Condition:** A lambda function `condition` checks if a cell has a '0' to its right, handling the edge case of the last column.
2. **Generate New Cells:**  It creates a set of new cells with value '2' where the condition is met.
3. **Paint to Output:** The new cells are painted onto the input grid to create the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) 
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for v, loc in obj:
      O = paint(O, {(v, loc)})
      if loc[1] < width(I) - 1 and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO:
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(loc, RIGHT))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:** It starts with a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate Objects and Cells:** It iterates through each object and each cell within the object.
3. **Paint Original and New:**  It paints the original cell value onto the canvas. If the cell is not on the right edge and has a '0' to its right, it paints a '2' to its right.
