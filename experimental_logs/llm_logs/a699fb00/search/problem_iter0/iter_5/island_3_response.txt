## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to insert the digit '2' to the right of every '1' in the input grid, only if that position is initially a '0'. 

**Input_0:** Each '1' is followed by a '0', so a '2' is inserted in those positions.

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, '2's are placed to the right of every '1', but only where there's an existing '0'.

**Input_2:** The pattern continues, highlighting that the transformation is specifically about placing '2's next to '1's if and only if the adjacent position is a '0'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(
        product(ofcolor(I, 1), {RIGHT}),
        lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0
    )))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
2. **`product(..., {RIGHT})`:** Generates a set of tuples representing the indices to the right of each '1'.
3. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:** Filters the generated tuples, keeping only those within the grid boundaries and containing '0'.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Transforms the filtered indices into an object with the value '2'.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the newly created object onto the original grid `I`, effectively placing '2's in the desired positions. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  shifted_ones = frozenset((i, j+1) for i in range(h) for j in range(w-1) if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, shifted_ones))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shape(I)`:**  Retrieves the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`shifted_ones`:**  Creates a set of indices shifted one position to the right of the '1's, but only if the adjacent cell is a '0'.
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Transforms the filtered indices into an object with the value '2'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the new object onto the original grid `I`, achieving the desired transformation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, downscale(hconcat(I,hupscale(vsplit(I,len(I))[0],2)),2),0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`vsplit(I,len(I))`:** Splits the grid into individual rows.
2. **`hupscale(...,2)`:** Upscales the first row horizontally by a factor of 2.
3. **`hconcat(I,...`:** Concatenates the original grid with the upscaled first row.
4. **`downscale(...,2)`:** Downscales the resulting grid by a factor of 2.
5. **`cellwise(I,...,0)`:** Merges the original grid with the downscaled grid, taking the original value unless they match, in which case it uses 0. This effectively shifts '1's to the right by one position and fills the gap with a '0'. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h,w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and j < w-1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 2, {(i,j+1)})
      else:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, I[i][j], {(i,j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(0, (h,w))`:** Creates a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with '0's.
2. **Iterate through the grid:** The nested loop iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Conditionally fill:** If a cell contains a '1' and its right neighbor is within bounds and contains a '0', a '2' is placed in the new grid at the right neighbor's position. Otherwise, the value from the input grid is directly copied to the new grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
    candidates = mfilter(
        apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones),
        lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])
    )
    twos = sfilter(candidates, lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)
    return paint(I, recolor(2, twos))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Finds all indices of cells with value '1'.
2. **`candidates = ...`**:  Calculates potential positions for '2's by shifting each '1' one position to the right and filtering out out-of-bounds indices.
3. **`twos = ...`:**  Filters `candidates` further, keeping only indices where the original grid has a '0'.
4. **`return paint(I, recolor(2, twos))`:** Paints '2's at the identified `twos` indices on the original grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
