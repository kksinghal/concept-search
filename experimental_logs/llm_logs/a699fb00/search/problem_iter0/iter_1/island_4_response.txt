## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit, excluding the background digit which appears most frequently) and extending them to the right by one cell, filling that cell with the digit '2'.

**Input_0:**

* Two objects formed by the digit '1' are identified.
* Each object is extended to the right by one cell, filling it with '2'.

**Input_1:**

* Several objects formed by the digit '1' are identified.
* Each object is extended to the right by one cell, filling it with '2'.
* Notice that objects at the right edge of the grid are not extended, as there is no space.

**Input_2:**

* Similar to Input_1, objects formed by '1' are extended to the right with '2', except when they touch the right edge of the grid. 

## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  extensions = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT), objs)
  valid_extensions = sfilter(extensions, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))
  O = fill(I, TWO, merge(valid_extensions))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Extensions:** `mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT), objs)` shifts each object one cell to the right. 
3. **Filter Valid Extensions:** `sfilter(extensions, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))` keeps only the extensions that fall within the grid boundaries.
4. **Fill Extensions:** `fill(I, TWO, merge(valid_extensions))` fills the valid extension cells with the digit '2'.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == ONE and j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcommon(I):
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Identify Extension Points:** If a cell contains '1' and the cell to its right is the background color (`mostcommon(I)`), it's marked for extension.
3. **Fill Extensions:** The marked cells are filled with '2'.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  intersection = toindices(intersection(asobject(I), shifted_right))
  valid_intersection = sfilter(intersection, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))
  extension = shift(valid_intersection, RIGHT)
  O = fill(I, TWO, extension)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:**  Shifts the entire grid one cell to the right.
2. **Find Intersection:**  Identifies the cells that overlap between the original and shifted grids, representing the cells immediately to the left of objects.
3. **Filter Valid Intersections:** Ensures the identified intersection cells are within the grid boundaries.
4. **Calculate Extensions:** Shifts the valid intersection cells to the right to get the extension points.
5. **Fill Extensions:**  Fills the extension points with '2'.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcommon(I):
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterates through each identified object in the grid.
2. **Check for Right Extension:** For each cell in the object, checks if it's possible to extend to the right (not at the edge and the cell to the right is background).
3. **Fill Extensions:** If extension is possible, fills the cell to the right with '2'. 

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(TWO, shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT)), 
                            sfilter(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True),
                                    lambda obj: rightmost(obj) < len(I[0]) - 1))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Finds all objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Extensible Objects:**  Keeps only objects that don't touch the right edge of the grid.
3. **Calculate Extensions:**  Shifts the indices of each remaining object one cell to the right.
4. **Recolor Extensions:** Changes the color of the extension cells to '2'.
5. **Paint Extensions:** Applies the recoloring to the original grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the language. Each version utilizes different combinations of functions and logic, making them distinct solutions to the problem.
