## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of adjacent '1's) within the input grid and extending those objects to the right by adding a '2' to their rightmost cell. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* Two objects are identified: one at the top left and one at the bottom left.
* For both objects, a '2' is added to the right of the rightmost '1'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

*  Six objects are identified.
*  For each object, a '2' is added to the right of the rightmost '1'.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

*  Six objects are identified.
*  For each object, a '2' is added to the right of the rightmost '1'.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    shifted_objs  =  mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
    filtered_cells = mfilter(lambda obj: len(obj) == 1, shifted_objs)
    O = fill(I, TWO, filtered_cells)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use the `objects` function to identify clusters of adjacent '1's.
2. **Shift right:** Each object is shifted one cell to the right using `shift(obj, RIGHT)`.
3. **Filter single cells:** The shifted objects are filtered to keep only those with a single cell using `mfilter(lambda obj: len(obj) == 1, shifted_objs)`. This ensures we're only targeting the newly added cells.
4. **Fill with '2':** Finally, the identified cells are filled with the value '2' using `fill(I, TWO, filtered_cells)`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j+1] == ZERO:
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i,j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check for right edge:** For each cell, it checks if the current cell is '1' and the cell to its right is '0'. This condition identifies the right edge of an object.
3. **Fill with '2':** If the condition is met, the cell to the right is filled with '2' in the output grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)))}, objs)
  shifted_cells = mapply(lambda cell: shift(cell, RIGHT), rightmost_cells)
  O = fill(I, TWO, shifted_cells)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The `objects` function identifies the objects within the grid.
2. **Find rightmost cells:** For each object, we extract the rightmost cell using `(uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))` and maintain its color. 
3. **Shift right:** These rightmost cells are shifted one position to the right using `shift`.
4. **Fill with '2':** Finally, the shifted cells are filled with '2' in the input grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    rightmost_cell = (color(obj), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1))
    O = paint(O, {rightmost_cell}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** An empty canvas of the same size as the input grid is created.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The program iterates through each object identified in the input grid.
3. **Paint object:**  The current object is painted onto the canvas.
4. **Calculate and paint rightmost cell:** The rightmost cell's location is calculated, and a '2' is painted at that location on the canvas.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
    O = cellwise(I, shifted_right, fallback=ZERO)
    O = fill(O, TWO, ofcolor(O, ONE))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Shift grid right:**  The entire input grid is treated as an object and shifted one cell to the right using `shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)`.
2. **Cellwise comparison:** A cell-by-cell comparison is performed between the original grid and the shifted grid. If the values match, the cell retains its original value; otherwise, it is set to '0'.
3. **Fill with '2':** Finally, all cells with the value '1' are filled with '2' using `fill(O, TWO, ofcolor(O, ONE))`.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version leverages different functions and logic, providing a diverse set of solutions.
