## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies the border cells of objects in the input grid and changes their value to '2'. The background and the interior of the objects remain unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 1 0
1 1 1
0 1 0
```

Output:
```
0 2 0
2 1 2
0 2 0
```

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return cffbageadbdfedbibcbadjejbbahbdgf(I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly utilizes the provided function `cffbageadbdfedbibcbadjejbbahbdgf` which already implements the desired logic.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  padded = vconcat((1,1), hconcat((1,1), vconcat(I, (1,1))))  # Add padding
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Initialize output with background color
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcolor(I) and any(v != mostcolor(I) for v in (padded[i][j], padded[i+2][j], padded[i+1][j+2], padded[i+1][j])):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)}) # Mark border cells
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version enhances the original `cffbageadbdfedbibcbadjejbbahbdgf` by initializing the output grid `O` with the background color using `canvas` and `mostcolor`. This makes the code more explicit and avoids potential issues with pre-existing values in the grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Initialize output
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True) # Extract objects
  for obj in objs:
    border = toindices(obj) & outbox(obj) # Find border cells
    O = fill(O, 2, border) # Mark border cells
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a different approach by utilizing the `objects` function to identify individual objects within the grid. It then uses `outbox` to find the indices of cells surrounding each object and intersects this set with the object's indices to identify border cells. This approach is more modular and avoids the need for manual padding.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and any(I[x][y] != mostcolor(I) for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly iterates through the inner cells of the grid (excluding the outermost rows and columns). It checks if a cell is not background and has at least one neighboring cell that's also not background, marking it as a border cell if true. This avoids explicit padding and relies on direct neighbor comparisons.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      i, j = cell
      if any(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == mostcolor(I) for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]):
        O = fill(O, 2, {cell})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines elements from previous versions. It uses `objects` to extract individual objects and then iterates through each cell of the object. For each cell, it checks if it has at least one background neighbor using `index` and marks it as a border cell if true. This approach balances efficiency and code readability.
