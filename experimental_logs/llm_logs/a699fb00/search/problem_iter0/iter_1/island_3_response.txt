## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects composed of the digit '1' and placing a digit '2' to the right of each '1' within the object. The background and other objects (not composed of '1') remain unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

Output:
```
1 2 1
0 1 2
```

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  
  ones = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  shifted_ones = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), ones) 
  filled_grid =  merge(apply(lambda obj: underfill(I, 2, obj), shifted_ones))
  O = cellwise(filled_grid, I, 0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:**  `objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected objects of '1's. 
2. **Shift Right:**  `shifted_ones` shifts each '1' object one position to the right.
3. **Fill with '2':**  `filled_grid`  fills '2's at the shifted positions on the original grid, only if the position is background (0).
4. **Combine:** `cellwise` combines the original grid and `filled_grid`, prioritizing the original grid's value unless it's background (0).


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_neighbors = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1]+1), ones)
  filtered_neighbors = sfilter(right_neighbors, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0) 
  O = fill(I, 2, filtered_neighbors) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' locations:** `ofcolor(I, 1)`  finds all indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **Get Right Neighbors:** `right_neighbors` calculates the indices of cells immediately to the right of each '1'.
3. **Filter Valid Neighbors:**  `filtered_neighbors` keeps only neighbor indices that are within the grid and contain a '0' (background).
4. **Fill with '2':** `fill(I, 2, filtered_neighbors)` places a '2' at each valid neighbor index.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and j < w - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for '1' and Valid Right:**  If a cell contains '1' and has a valid right neighbor (within the grid and containing '0'), proceed.
3. **Fill with '2':** `fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)})` places a '2' at the valid right neighbor.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = asobject(I) & recolor(1, asindices(I))
  shifted_right = shift(ones, RIGHT)
  intersection = toindices(shifted_right) & asindices(I)
  filtered = sfilter(intersection, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0) 
  O = fill(I, 2, filtered)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' cells as Object:** `ones` gets all cells containing '1' as an object.
2. **Shift Right:** `shifted_right` shifts the '1' object one position to the right.
3. **Find Valid Overlaps:**  `intersection` gets indices present in both the shifted object and the original grid, ensuring valid locations.
4. **Filter Background Cells:** `filtered` keeps indices from `intersection` that correspond to background cells (containing '0') in the original grid.
5. **Fill with '2':** `fill(I, 2, filtered)` fills '2's at the filtered indices.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_grid = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  h, w = shape(I)
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1: 
        shifted_grid = fill(shifted_grid, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_grid, 0) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Shifted Grid:** `shifted_grid` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, initialized with '0's.
2. **Iterate and Mark:** The code iterates through the input grid, and if it finds a '1', it marks the corresponding cell in `shifted_grid` one position to the right with a '2'. 
3. **Combine:** Finally, `cellwise` combines the original grid with `shifted_grid`. If a cell in the original grid is '0' (background), the value from `shifted_grid` is used; otherwise, the original value is kept.
