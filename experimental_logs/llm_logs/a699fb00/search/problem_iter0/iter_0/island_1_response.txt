## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background digit, which is 0 in these cases) and inserting a 'border' of the digit '2' around each object within the input grid.

**Example Breakdown:**

Consider Input_0:

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

The output is:

```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Here's what happens:

1.  **Object Identification:** Two objects are identified: the two '1's in the top row and the two '1's in the bottom row.
2.  **Border Insertion:**  A border of '2's is inserted around each object. Notice that the border only occupies cells that were originally '0's (the background).

The same logic applies to Input_1 and Input_2, where the transformation adds a '2' border around each distinct object formed by the '1's.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify objects, no diagonals, without background
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    border = delta(toindices(obj)) # Get the border indices
    O = fill(O, 2, border) # Fill the border with '2'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies objects within the grid `I`. `T, F, T` specifies univalued objects, no diagonal connections, and exclusion of the background.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates through each identified object `obj`. For each object:
   -  `delta(toindices(obj))` determines the border indices around the object.
   -  `fill(O, 2, border)` fills the identified border indices with the digit '2' in the grid `O` (which initially is a copy of `I`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas of background color
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcolor(I): # If it's not background
        O = fill(O, 2, neighbors((i, j))) # Fill neighbors with '2'
        O = fill(O, val, {(i, j)}) # Repaint the original cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates through each cell in `I`. 
   - If the cell is not the background color:
     - It fills the neighboring cells in `O` with '2'.
     - It then repaints the original cell in `O` with its original value from `I`. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded = vconcat((1,1), hconcat((1,1), vconcat(I, (1,1))))  # Add a padding of '1's
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcolor(I) and any(v != mostcolor(I) for v in (padded[i][j], padded[i+2][j], padded[i+1][j+2], padded[i+1][j])):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)}) # Fill the current cell with '2' if it's a border cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Padding:** Adds a padding of '1's around the input grid to simplify border detection.
2. **Border Detection:**  Iterates through the original grid `I`. If a cell is not background and has at least one background neighbor (checked using the padded grid), it's considered a border cell.
3. **Fill Border:** If a cell is identified as a border cell, it's filled with '2' in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I 
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj)-1, lowermost(obj)+2):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+2):
        if (i, j) not in toindices(obj) and 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I): # Inside bounding box, not part of object, within grid boundaries
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** Similar to version 1, it identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Bounding Box Iteration:** For each object, it iterates through the cells within its bounding box (expanded by 1 cell in all directions).
3. **Border Fill:**  If a cell is within the bounding box, not part of the object, and within the grid's boundaries, it is filled with '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Start with a blank canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i,j))}) # Place the object cell
        if any(index(I, (ni, nj)) == mostcolor(I) for ni, nj in neighbors((i, j))): # Check for background neighbors
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})  # Fill with '2' if it has background neighbors
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:** Starts with a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** Iterates through the input grid. For each non-background cell:
   - It paints that cell onto the canvas with its original value.
   - It checks if the cell has any background neighbors. If yes, it fills the cell with '2' on the canvas, effectively creating the border.
