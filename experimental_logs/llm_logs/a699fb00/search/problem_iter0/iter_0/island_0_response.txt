## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in all input-output pairs involves identifying objects (connected components) formed by the digit '1' and adding a '2' to the right of each '1' if that cell is empty (0). Let's analyze each pair:

**Pair 0:**
- Input: Two single-cell objects formed by '1'.
- Output: A '2' is added to the right of each '1', effectively extending the objects horizontally by one cell.

**Pair 1:**
- Input: Four two-cell objects formed by '1'. 
- Output: Each object is extended by adding a '2' to the right of the rightmost '1' cell.

**Pair 2:**
- Input: Five two-cell objects formed by '1'.
- Output: Again, a '2' is added to the right of the rightmost '1' cell in each object.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, all achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_A's object identification and Program_B's underfill):**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) 
  extension = frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for obj in objs for v, loc in obj)
  O = underfill(I, TWO, extension)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies objects formed by '1's only, considering only directly adjacent cells and excluding the background.
2. **Calculate extension:** `extension` calculates the indices where '2's should be placed by shifting each object cell to the right.
3. **Apply underfill:** `underfill(I, TWO, extension)` fills the calculated indices with '2's only if the original cell was empty (background color).

**Version 2 (Utilizing shift and recolor):**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  shifted_ones = shift(ones, RIGHT)
  O = underfill(I, TWO, shifted_ones)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find '1' indices:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds the indices of all '1's in the grid.
2. **Shift right:**  `shift(ones, RIGHT)` shifts the indices one position to the right.
3. **Underfill:** `underfill(I, TWO, shifted_ones)` fills the shifted indices with '2's only if they were originally empty.

**Version 3 (Leveraging cellwise comparison):**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_right = shift(I, RIGHT)
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_right, fallback=TWO)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Shift grid right:**  `shift(I, RIGHT)` creates a copy of the input grid shifted one position to the right.
2. **Cellwise comparison:** `cellwise(I, shifted_right, TWO)` compares the original and shifted grids cell by cell. If the values match, the original value is kept. If they don't, a '2' is placed. This effectively adds '2's to the right of '1's.

**Version 4 (Using loop and index manipulation):**

```python
def solve(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w - 1): 
            if O[i][j] == ONE and O[i][j+1] == ZERO:
                O[i][j+1] = TWO
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create a copy:**  A nested list comprehension creates a mutable copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate and modify:** The code iterates through each cell (except the last column) and checks if it's a '1' with an empty cell to its right. If so, it places a '2' in the empty cell.
3. **Return as tuple:**  The modified grid is converted back to a tuple.

**Version 5 (Employing map and lambda function):**

```python
def solve(I):
    return tuple(tuple(map(lambda x,y: TWO if x==ONE and y==ZERO else y, row[:-1], row[1:]) + (row[-1],) for row in I))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Lambda for pairwise comparison:** A lambda function takes two adjacent cell values and returns '2' if the first is '1' and the second is '0', otherwise returning the second cell value.
2. **Map and slicing:** `map` applies the lambda function to pairs of adjacent cells in each row, effectively adding '2's where needed. Slicing (`row[:-1], row[1:]`) is used to create these pairs. 
3. **Concatenation and tuple conversion:** The last element of each row is concatenated back to ensure no data loss. Finally, the result is converted back to a tuple.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each utilizes distinct logic and combinations of DSL functions, offering a variety of solutions to the problem.
