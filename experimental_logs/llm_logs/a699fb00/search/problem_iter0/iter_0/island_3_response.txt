## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of the digit '1' in the input grid and expanding them to the right by adding a '2' to the right of each '1'. 

**Input_0:**

* Two separate '1' objects are present.
* Both objects are expanded to the right by adding a '2'.

**Input_1:**

* Four separate '1' objects are present.
* All objects are expanded to the right by adding a '2'.

**Input_2:**

* Five separate '1' objects are present.
* All objects are expanded to the right by adding a '2'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Find all connected objects
    one_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)  # Filter for objects with color '1'
    expanded_objs = frozenset({
        combine(obj, {(1, add(loc, RIGHT))})  # Expand each object by adding '2' to the right
        for obj in one_objs for loc in toindices(obj) if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0
    })
    O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))  # Paint the expanded objects onto the input grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Find all connected objects in the input grid.
2. **Filter for '1' objects:** Select only the objects consisting of the digit '1'.
3. **Expand objects:**  For each '1' object, iterate over its cells and add a new cell with value '2' to the right, but only if the cell to the right is empty (value '0').
4. **Paint expanded objects:**  Combine all expanded objects and paint them onto the original input grid, effectively adding the '2's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and j + 1 < len(row) and I[i][j+1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through the grid:** Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for '1' and empty right cell:** If the current cell is '1' and its right neighbor is empty ('0'), proceed.
3. **Fill with '2':**  Fill the right neighbor cell with '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = asindices(I)
  right_shifted = shift(indices, RIGHT)
  intersection = indices & right_shifted
  expansion_candidates = {subtract(loc, RIGHT) for loc in intersection}
  expansion_indices = frozenset({loc for loc in expansion_candidates if index(I, loc) == 1 and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0})
  O = fill(I, 2, expansion_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get all indices and shifted indices:** Find indices of all cells and their right-shifted counterparts.
2. **Identify potential expansion candidates:**  Find the intersection of original and shifted indices, representing cells with a right neighbor.
3. **Filter for '1' with empty right:** Select candidates where the cell value is '1' and the right neighbor is '0'.
4. **Fill with '2':** Fill the selected candidate cells' right neighbors with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
    expansion_candidates = sfilter(one_indices, lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0)
    expansion_indices = shift(expansion_candidates, RIGHT)
    O = fill(I, 2, expansion_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find indices of '1':** Get the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Filter for empty right neighbors:** Keep only the indices whose right neighbor is '0'.
3. **Shift to get expansion indices:** Shift the filtered indices to the right to target the empty neighbors.
4. **Fill with '2':**  Fill the identified expansion indices with '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 1 and val == 0 else val
            for j, val in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and check:** This version directly iterates through the grid and modifies the values during iteration.
2. **Conditional replacement:** If a cell is '0' and its right neighbor is '1', it gets replaced with '2'.


Each version utilizes different DSL functions and strategies to achieve the same result.
