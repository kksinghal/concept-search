## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of the digit '1' and extending them to the right by adding a '2' digit. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

* The single object of '1's is extended to the right by one cell containing the digit '2'. 

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

*  All four objects of '1's, regardless of their position or orientation, are extended to the right by one cell containing the digit '2'.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

* Similar to the previous examples, all objects of '1's are extended to the right by one cell with the digit '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  extensions = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT), objs)
  O = fill(I, TWO, merge(extensions))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We first use the `objects` function to identify all connected regions of '1's in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Calculate Extensions:** For each object, we calculate the indices of cells to the right using `shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT)`. `mapply` applies this to all objects.
3. **Fill Extensions:** We merge all the extension indices using `merge` and fill them with the digit '2' in the input grid using `fill`.
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned as the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == ONE and j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO:
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This program iterates through each cell in the grid. If a cell contains '1' and its right neighbor is '0', it proceeds.
2. **Fill Right Neighbor:** The right neighbor cell is filled with '2'.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices_one = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  right_indices = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), indices_one)
  valid_indices = sfilter(right_indices, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]), right_indices)
  O = fill(I, TWO, valid_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1's and Right Neighbors:** We first identify all indices of '1's and then generate indices of their right neighbors.
2. **Validate Indices:** Filter the right neighbor indices to ensure they fall within the grid boundaries.
3. **Fill Valid Indices:** Fill the valid right neighbor indices with '2' in the input grid.
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned as the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  intersection = toindices(intersection(asobject(I), shifted_right))
  extension = shift(intersection, RIGHT)
  O = fill(I, TWO, extension)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Intersect:** This version leverages set operations. We shift the entire grid to the right and find the intersection with the original grid. This intersection represents cells with '1' having a right neighbor within the grid.
2. **Calculate Extension:** The intersection is shifted right to get the target indices for '2'.
3. **Fill and Return:** We fill these indices with '2' and return the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    extended_obj = combine(obj, recolor(TWO, shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT)))
    O = paint(O, extended_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** We create a new grid (`O`) filled with zeros, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** For each '1' object identified, we extend it to the right by creating a new object with '2' in the adjacent cell.
3. **Paint Extended Object:** This extended object is painted onto the canvas.
4. **Return Canvas:** The final canvas `O` represents the transformed grid. 


These five programs demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each leverages different functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
