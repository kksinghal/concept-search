## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by adjacent '1's in the input grid and adding a '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* Two objects are identified: one in the top left corner and one at the bottom left. 
* In both objects, a '2' is placed to the right of each existing '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Five objects are identified across the grid.
* The transformation logic remains consistent: a '2' is added to the right of every '1' within each object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* Similar to previous examples, five objects are identified.
* The transformation is applied consistently: a '2' is placed to the right of each '1' within each object.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions (Program_to_be_generated) to achieve the desired transformation using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify objects formed by adjacent '1's
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs) # Shift each object one position to the right
  indices_to_fill = mfilter(lambda obj: intersection(toindices(obj), asindices(I)), shifted_objs) # Get indices of shifted objects that are within the grid bounds
  O = underfill(I, TWO, indices_to_fill)  # Fill '2' at valid shifted indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies objects formed by adjacent '1's in the grid `I`. 
2. **Shift Objects:** `mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)` shifts each identified object one position to the right.
3. **Filter Valid Indices:** `mfilter(lambda obj: intersection(toindices(obj), asindices(I)), shifted_objs)` finds the indices of the shifted objects that fall within the original grid's boundaries.
4. **Fill with '2':** `underfill(I, TWO, indices_to_fill)` fills '2' at the valid shifted indices, effectively adding a '2' to the right of each '1' within each object.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Get indices of all '1's
  neighbors_right = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1]+1), ones) # Calculate indices one position to the right of each '1'
  valid_neighbors = intersection(neighbors_right, asindices(I)) # Filter indices that fall within the grid bounds
  O = underfill(I, TWO, valid_neighbors) # Fill '2' at valid neighbor indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Indices:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of all '1's in the grid.
2. **Calculate Right Neighbors:**  `mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1]+1), ones)` calculates the indices directly to the right of each '1'.
3. **Validate Indices:**  `intersection(neighbors_right, asindices(I))` filters the calculated indices to retain only those within the grid's boundaries.
4. **Fill with '2':** `underfill(I, TWO, valid_neighbors)` fills '2' at the valid neighbor indices, effectively adding a '2' to the right of each '1'. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I  # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j+1] == ZERO:  # Check if current cell is '1' and the cell to the right is '0'
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j+1)})  # If true, fill '2' at the cell to the right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid (except the last column). For each cell, it checks if the cell contains a '1' and its right neighbor is '0'.
2. **Fill with '2':** If the condition is met, it fills the right neighbor cell with a '2' in the output grid `O`. This directly implements the transformation logic.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify objects formed by adjacent '1's
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for value, (i, j) in obj: 
      if j < len(I[0])-1 and (value, (i, j+1)) not in obj:  # Check if the right neighbor is within bounds and not part of the same object
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j+1)})  # If true, fill '2' in the output grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Iterate:** Similar to previous versions, this code identifies objects of '1's. It then iterates through each cell within each object.
2. **Check Right Neighbor:** For every cell, it checks if the right neighbor exists within the grid and is not part of the same object.
3. **Fill with '2':** If both conditions are met, it fills the right neighbor cell with a '2' in the output grid. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_grid = rot90(rot90(I)) # Rotate the grid by 180 degrees
  O = I
  for i in range(len(shifted_grid)):
    for j in range(len(shifted_grid[0])-1):
      if shifted_grid[i][j] == ZERO and shifted_grid[i][j+1] == ONE: # Check if current cell is '0' and the cell to the right is '1' in the rotated grid
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)}) # If true, fill '2' in the original grid's corresponding cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate Grid:**  The code first rotates the input grid `I` by 180 degrees using `rot90(rot90(I))`.
2. **Iterate and Check:** It iterates through each cell of the rotated grid (except the last column). It checks if a cell contains a '0' and its right neighbor contains a '1'.
3. **Fill in Original Grid:** If the condition is met, it fills the current cell in the original grid `O` with a '2'. This leverages the rotation to achieve the desired transformation. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a unique perspective on how to solve the problem within the constraints of the DSL.
