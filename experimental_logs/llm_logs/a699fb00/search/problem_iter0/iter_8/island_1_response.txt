## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending each object by one cell to the right with the value '2', but only if the extension doesn't overwrite an existing object cell. 

**Input_0:**

* The top-left '1' gets extended to the right with '2'.
* The bottom-left '1' gets extended to the right with '2'.

**Input_1:**

* All six '1's get extended to the right with '2'.

**Input_2:**

* All six '1's get extended to the right with '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

### Version 1: 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Start with a blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True): # Iterate over objects
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint the original object
    extension = recolor(2, sfilter(toindices(shift(obj, RIGHT)), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == mostcolor(I))) # Find valid extension cells
    O = paint(O, extension)  # Paint the extension
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** A canvas of the same size as the input grid `I` is created, filled with the most common color in `I` (background).
2. **Object Iteration:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
3. **Object Painting:**  The current object (`obj`) is painted onto the canvas `O`.
4. **Extension Calculation:**  The `shift(obj, RIGHT)` function shifts the object one cell to the right. `toindices` extracts the indices of this shifted object. `sfilter` filters these indices, keeping only those locations where the input grid `I` has the background color. Finally, `recolor(2, ...)` colors these filtered indices with the value '2', representing the extension.
5. **Extension Painting:** The calculated extension is then painted onto the canvas `O`.

### Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as a copy of the input
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
            O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy Input:** The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Check Right Cell:** For each cell within an object, it checks if the cell to its right is the background color.
4. **Paint Extension:** If the right cell is background, it paints a '2' on the output grid `O` at that location.

### Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        O = paint(O, obj)
        right_edge = frozenset((i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))
        extension = sfilter(right_edge, lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == mostcolor(I))
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, extension))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Initialize output `O` as a blank canvas.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid `I`.
3. **Paint Object:** Paint the current object onto the canvas `O`.
4. **Identify Right Edge:** Determine the indices of the rightmost column of the object.
5. **Filter Valid Extensions:** Filter the right edge indices, keeping only those where the cell to the right in the input grid `I` is the background color.
6. **Paint Extensions:** Color the valid extension cells with '2' and paint them onto the output grid `O`.

### Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for x in range(len(I)):
        for y in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
            if I[x][y] != mostcolor(I) and I[x][y + 1] == mostcolor(I):
                O = paint(O, {(2, (x, y + 1))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy Input:** The output `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Cells:** Loop through each cell in the input grid, excluding the last column.
3. **Check Right Neighbor:** For each cell, check if it's part of an object and its right neighbor is the background.
4. **Paint Extension:** If the conditions are met, paint a '2' at the right neighbor's location in the output grid `O`.

### Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    extensions = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: recolor(2, sfilter(toindices(shift(obj, RIGHT)), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == mostcolor(I))))
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(objs, extensions))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Get all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Extensions:** For each object, calculate its valid rightward extension using `recolor`, `sfilter`, `shift`, and `toindices`. `mfilter` filters out empty extensions.
3. **Combine and Paint:** Merge the original objects and their extensions. Then, paint them onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.


These five versions use various combinations of DSL functions and logic, providing different approaches to achieve the same transformation.
