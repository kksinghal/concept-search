## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing a zero (0) with a two (2) in the input grid, only if the zero is immediately to the right of a one (1).

**Example:**

```
Input:
1 0 
0 0

Output:
1 2
0 0
```

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The zero at (0,1) is replaced with a two because it is to the right of a one at (0,0).
- The same logic applies to the zero at (3,2) which gets replaced by a two. 

**Input_1 and Input_2:**

- The same logic applies to all other input-output pairs, where zeros to the right of ones are replaced with twos.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by `egfcdiaieebceeggaeebcfhjfcfdabdd` - Program A)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(TWO if j > 0 and row[j-1] == ONE and v == ZERO else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each row and cell of the input grid.
- If a cell's value is ZERO and it's not the first cell in the row (j > 0) and the previous cell's value is ONE, then it replaces the cell's value with TWO. 
- Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by `hconcat` function)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
        tuple(v if j==0 else (TWO if v == ZERO and row[j - 1] == ONE else v) for j, v in enumerate(r)) 
        for r in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each row and cell of the input grid.
- Uses nested ternary operators for conciseness:
    - If it's the first cell in the row (j==0), keep the original value.
    - Otherwise, check if the current cell is ZERO and the previous cell is ONE. If true, replace with TWO, else keep the original value.

**Version 3:** (Inspired by nested loops)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = list(list(row) for row in I) # Create a mutable copy
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(1, len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == ZERO and I[i][j - 1] == ONE:
                O[i][j] = TWO
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a mutable copy of the input grid.
- Iterates through each row and cell (starting from the second cell in each row).
- Applies the transformation logic: replace zero with two if the previous cell is one.
- Converts the mutable copy back to a tuple and returns it.

**Version 4:** (Inspired by `apply` and lambda functions)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(apply(lambda row: tuple(TWO if j > 0 and row[j-1] == ONE and v == ZERO else v for j, v in enumerate(row)), I))
```

**Explanation:**

- Utilizes the `apply` function to apply a lambda function to each row in the grid.
- The lambda function checks the transformation logic for each cell and returns the transformed row.

**Version 5:** (Inspired by `papply` function)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(papply(lambda v, prev: TWO if j > 0 and prev == ONE and v == ZERO else v, r, (ZERO,) + r[:-1])) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

- Applies the `papply` function to each row, comparing each cell with its preceding cell by creating a shifted tuple `(ZERO,) + r[:-1]`.
- The lambda function within `papply` implements the transformation logic.

These are just a few examples, and you can explore further variations using different combinations of DSL functions and programming constructs. The key is to understand the transformation logic and implement it effectively and efficiently within the constraints of the provided DSL.
