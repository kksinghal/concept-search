## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected '1's (considering only direct neighbors, not diagonals), then placing a '2' to the right of each '1' within the object if that position is currently a '0' (background). 

**Let's break it down with examples:**

* **Input_0:** 
    * There are two objects formed by '1's.
    * In the top object, the rightmost '1' gets a '2' placed to its right.
    * In the bottom object, both '1's get a '2' placed to their right.
* **Input_1 and Input_2:** 
    * The same logic applies, with '2's being placed to the right of '1's in all objects within the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify objects of connected '1's
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj: # Iterate over each cell of the object
      if j+1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j+1] == ZERO: # Check if the right cell is within bounds and is '0'
        I = fill(I, TWO, {(i, j+1)}) # Fill the right cell with '2'
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies objects formed by connected '1's. 
2. **Iterate & Fill:** It iterates through each cell of each object. If a cell's right neighbor is within the grid bounds and has a value of '0', it's filled with a '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return apply(
      lambda row: tuple(TWO if j>0 and row[j-1] == ONE and cell == ZERO else cell for j, cell in enumerate(row)),
      I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Apply on Rows:** This version uses `apply` to process each row of the grid individually.
2. **Conditional Replacement:**  For each cell, it checks if the cell to its left is '1' and the current cell is '0'. If true, it replaces the current cell with '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  shifted = shift(fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ONE, asindices(I)), RIGHT)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if I[i][j] == ONE and shifted[i][j] == ONE else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Shifted Grid:** It creates a shifted version of the grid where all '1's are moved one position to the right.
2. **Compare and Fill:** It then compares the original grid with the shifted grid. If a cell in the original grid is '1' and the corresponding cell in the shifted grid is also '1', it means there was a '1' to its right originally, so the current cell is replaced with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        TWO if I[i][j] == ONE and j < len(I[0])-1 and I[i][j+1] == ZERO else I[i][j] 
        for j in range(len(I[0]))
      ) 
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Iteration and Replacement:** This version directly iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check and Replace:** It checks if the current cell is '1', if it's not on the rightmost edge, and if the cell to its right is '0'. If all conditions are met, the current cell is replaced by '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(j < len(row)-1 and row[j] == ONE and row[j+1] == ZERO, TWO, cell)
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Branch:** This version iterates through each cell and uses the `branch` function for conditional replacement.
2. **Condition and Replacement:** The `branch` function checks if the current cell is not the last in the row, is equal to '1', and the next cell is '0'. If true, it replaces the current cell with '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original cell value. 


All five versions achieve the desired transformation but utilize different approaches and combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the provided DSL.
