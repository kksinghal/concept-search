## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending all objects (groups of connected, non-zero digits) to the right by one cell, filling the new cell with the value '2'.

**Input_0 Example:**

- The '1's at (0,0) and (0,2) are extended to the right, becoming '1 2'.
- The '1's at (3,1) and (3,3) are extended to the right, becoming '1 2'.

**Input_1 & Input_2 Examples:**

- The same logic applies, extending all '1' objects to the right by one cell and filling the new cell with '2'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  extension = frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for obj in objs for v, loc in obj if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO)
  O = paint(I, extension)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all objects (connected non-zero digits) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Extension:**  For each object, iterate over its cells (`loc`). If the cell to the right (`add(loc, RIGHT)`) is empty (value `ZERO` in the input grid), add a new cell with value `TWO` at that location to the `extension` set.
3. **Paint Extension:** `paint(I, extension)` paints the `extension` set onto the input grid `I`, effectively extending the objects.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return fill(I, TWO, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) != ZERO and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get All Indices:**  `asindices(I)` creates a set of all cell indices in the grid.
2. **Filter for Extension:** `mfilter` keeps only those indices where the cell itself is not empty (`index(I, loc) != ZERO`) and the cell to the right is empty (`index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO`).
3. **Fill Extension:** `fill(I, TWO, ...)` fills the filtered indices with the value `TWO`. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  return cellwise(I, shifted_grid, fallback=ZERO)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:** `shifted_grid` is created by shifting the entire input grid (`asobject(I)`) one cell to the right.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** `cellwise(I, shifted_grid, fallback=ZERO)` compares the original and shifted grids.  If both cells have the same value (meaning the original cell was part of an object), the original value is kept. Otherwise, `ZERO` is used (effectively extending the object with a '2' since the shifted grid has a '0' in that position).


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) for v, loc in obj if add(loc, RIGHT) not in toindices(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all objects (connected non-zero digits) in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Find Extension Points:** For each object, iterate over its cells (`loc`). If the cell to the right (`add(loc, RIGHT)`) is not part of any object (including background), add a new cell with value `TWO` at that location to the `extension` set.
3. **Paint Extension:** `paint(I, extension)` paints the `extension` set onto the input grid `I`, effectively extending the objects to the right.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  extended_objects = frozenset(
        frozenset(
            (v, (i, j)) if j != rightmost(obj) else (TWO, (i, j + 1))
            for v, (i, j) in obj
        )
        for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    )
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), extended_objects)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all objects.
2. **Extend Objects:**  For each object, iterate over its cells. If a cell is on the rightmost edge (`j == rightmost(obj)`), extend the object by adding a new cell with value `TWO` to its right.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** Create a blank canvas (`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`) and paint the extended objects onto it.
