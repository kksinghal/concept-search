## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending each object (group of connected '1's) in the input grid to the right by one cell, filling this new cell with the value '2'. However, this extension only happens if the new cell would fall within the original object's bounding box. This means objects at the right edge of the grid won't be extended.

**Example:**

Input:

```
1 1 1
0 1 0
```

Output:

```
1 2 1
0 1 0 
```

Here, the object is extended to the right, but the final '1' is not extended because it would go beyond the object's width.

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  extension = frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for obj in objs for v, loc in obj if loc[1] < width(obj) - 1)
  O = underfill(I, TWO, extension)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all the objects in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Extension:** `extension = frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for obj in objs for v, loc in obj if loc[1] < width(obj) - 1)` calculates the indices of the cells to be filled with '2'. It iterates over each object, and for each cell within the object, it checks if the cell is not at the rightmost edge (`loc[1] < width(obj) - 1`). If it's not, the cell to the right (`add(loc, RIGHT)`) is added to the `extension` set with the value '2'.
3. **Fill the Extension:** `O = underfill(I, TWO, extension)` fills the calculated extension cells in the input grid `I` with the value '2' only if those cells were originally empty (background color).
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned as the output.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for loc in toindices(obj):
      if loc[1] < rightmost(obj):
        O = fill(O, TWO, {add(loc, RIGHT)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects and Cells:** This version iterates through each object and then each cell within the object.
2. **Conditional Fill:**  For each cell, it checks if it's not on the rightmost edge of the object (`loc[1] < rightmost(obj)`). If it's not, it fills the cell to the right (`add(loc, RIGHT)`) with the value '2' using `fill`.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid is returned as output. 

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_right, fallback=ZERO)
  O = replace(O, ONE, TWO)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Right:** `shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)` shifts the entire input grid one cell to the right.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** `O = cellwise(I, shifted_right, fallback=ZERO)` compares the original grid with the shifted grid. If a cell in the original grid matches the corresponding cell in the shifted grid, it keeps its value. Otherwise, it is set to '0'. This essentially creates a grid where only overlapping '1's remain.
3. **Replace with '2':**  `O = replace(O, ONE, TWO)` replaces all the remaining '1's in the output grid with '2's, achieving the desired extension.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for x in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)):
      O = fill(O, TWO, {(uppermost(obj), x + 1)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** An empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input is created.
2. **Iterate and Paint:**  The program iterates over each object in the input. For each object, it first paints the object onto the canvas `O`. 
3. **Horizontal Fill:** Then, it iterates through each column within the object's bounding box and fills the cell to the right of each object cell with '2'. 

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I) - 1):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO:
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** This version directly iterates over each cell in the input grid (except the last column).
2. **Conditional Fill:** For each cell, it checks if the cell contains a '1' and its right neighbor is a '0'. If both conditions are true, it fills the right neighbor with '2'.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each utilizing different combinations of functions provided in the DSL.
