## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying '1' digits in the input grid and then changing their immediate right neighbors to '2', provided the right neighbors are '0' and within the grid boundaries. 

**Let's illustrate with Input_0:**

```
Input_0:        Output_0:
1 0 1 0 0      1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0      0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0      0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0  -->  0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0      0 0 0 0 0 
```

As you can see, only the '0's directly to the right of '1's are changed to '2's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(
      product(ofcolor(I, 1), {RIGHT}),
      lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0
  )))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`**:  Identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **`product(..., {RIGHT})`**: Generates a set of tuples representing the right neighbors of each '1'.
3. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`**: Filters the neighbors, keeping only those within the grid boundaries and containing '0'.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`**: Changes the color of the filtered neighbors to '2'.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Applies the color change to the original grid, resulting in the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_neighbors = frozenset((i, j+1) for i, j in ones if j + 1 < len(I[0]))
  valid_neighbors = sfilter(right_neighbors, lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)
  return fill(I, 2, valid_neighbors)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`**:  Stores the indices of all '1's in the `ones` variable.
2. **`right_neighbors = ...`**: Creates a set of right neighbors for each '1', ensuring they are within the grid's horizontal boundaries.
3. **`valid_neighbors = ...`**: Filters `right_neighbors`, keeping only those containing '0' in the input grid.
4. **`return fill(I, 2, valid_neighbors)`**: Fills the `valid_neighbors` with '2' on the original grid to produce the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  new_grid = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        new_grid[i][j + 1] = 2
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = ...`**:  Stores the height and width of the input grid for easier access.
2. **`new_grid = ...`**: Creates a mutable copy of the input grid.
3. **`for i in range(h): ...`**: Iterates through each cell of the grid.
4. **`if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0: ...`**: Checks if a cell contains '1' and its right neighbor is '0'.
5. **`new_grid[i][j + 1] = 2`**: If the condition is met, changes the right neighbor in the `new_grid` to '2'.
6. **`return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)`**: Returns the modified `new_grid` as an immutable tuple. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0 else val
      for j, val in enumerate(row)
    ) for row in I
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`... for row in I`**: Iterates through each row in the input grid.
2. **`... for j, val in enumerate(row)`**: Iterates through each cell (and its index) in the current row.
3. **`2 if ... else val`**: Uses a conditional expression to determine the new value for each cell:
    - **`j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0`**:  Checks if the current cell is not the last in the row, contains '1', and its right neighbor is '0'. If true, the cell's value is set to '2'.
    - **`else val`**: Otherwise, the original cell value (`val`) is retained.
4. **`tuple(tuple(...))`**:  Converts the modified rows back into an immutable grid format.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
   return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(
              j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0,
              2,
              row[j],
          )
          for j in range(len(row))
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`... for row in I`**: Iterates through each row in the input grid.
2. **`... for j in range(len(row))`**: Iterates through each cell's index in the current row.
3. **`branch(..., 2, row[j])`**:  Uses the `branch` function to determine the new value for each cell:
    - **`j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0`**:  This condition checks if the current cell is not the last in the row, contains '1', and its right neighbor is '0'. 
    - **`2`**:  If the condition is true, the cell's value is set to '2'.
    - **`row[j]`**: Otherwise, the original cell value (`row[j]`) is retained.
4. **`tuple(tuple(...))`**:  Converts the modified rows back into an immutable grid format.

These five program versions showcase various ways to achieve the same grid transformation using different DSL function combinations and logic, offering diverse and efficient solutions.
