## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying '1' digits horizontally adjacent to a '0' digit and replacing the '0' with a '2'. This transformation only applies to the first occurrence of '0' to the right of a '1' in each row. 

**Input_0:**
- In the first row, the '0' at index 2 is adjacent to a '1' and is replaced by a '2'.
- In the fourth row, a similar replacement occurs.

**Input_1 & Input_2:**
- The same logic is applied to each row in these inputs. 

## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def modify_row(row):
    new_row = list(row)  # Create a mutable copy of the row
    for i in range(1, len(row)):  # Start from the second element
      if row[i-1] == 1 and row[i] == 0:
        new_row[i] = 2  # Modify the list in-place
        break  # Only modify the first occurrence
    return tuple(new_row)
  return tuple(modify_row(r) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**
- This version iterates through each row, identifying the first '0' next to a '1' and replacing it with a '2'.
- It avoids nested loops by modifying a mutable copy of each row.
- The `break` statement ensures only the first occurrence is modified. 

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j > 0 and r[j-1] == 1 and v == 0 else v for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I) 
```

**Explanation:** 
- This version uses nested list comprehensions for a more concise approach.
- It iterates through each cell, checking if the preceding cell is '1' and the current cell is '0'.
- If true, it replaces the current cell with '2'.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return tuple(tuple(branch(j > 0 and r[j-1] == 1 and v == 0, 2, v) for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**
- Similar to Version 2, but utilizes the `branch` function from the DSL for conditional replacement. 

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def process_cell(j, v, r):
    return 2 if j > 0 and r[j-1] == 1 and v == 0 else v
  return tuple(tuple(process_cell(j, v, r) for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**
- This version abstracts the cell processing logic into a separate function (`process_cell`) for better readability.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def check_and_replace(row, idx):
    return tuple(2 if i == idx and row[i-1] == 1 and row[i] == 0 else v for i, v in enumerate(row))
  new_grid = tuple()
  for row in I:
    found = False
    for i in range(1, len(row)):
      if row[i-1] == 1 and row[i] == 0:
        new_grid = new_grid + (check_and_replace(row, i),)
        found = True
        break
    if not found:
      new_grid = new_grid + (row,)
  return new_grid 
```

**Explanation:**
- This version iterates through rows, finding the index of the first '0' after a '1'. 
- It then uses the `check_and_replace` function to modify the row only at that specific index.
- This approach minimizes unnecessary iterations and modifications.
