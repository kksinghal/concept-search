## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation can be summarized as follows:

**For each cell containing the value '1':**

* **If** the cell to the **right** exists (within the grid boundaries) and contains a '0', 
    * **Then** change the value of the cell to the right to '2'.

This effectively extends any horizontal sequence of '1's to the right by one cell, replacing a '0' with a '2'. 

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The '1's in the first and fourth rows have their right neighbors changed to '2'.
* **Input_1:**  The same logic applies, extending the horizontal '1' sequences in the second, fifth, seventh, and ninth rows.
* **Input_2:** Similar to the previous examples, the transformation extends the '1' sequences in rows two, three, six, and ten. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1 (Iterative Approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid with zeros
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      O = fill(O, val, (i, j)) # Copy original value
      if val == ONE and j < len(row) - 1:
        O = fill(O, TWO, (i, j + 1)) # Fill right neighbor with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty output grid (`O`) of the same size as the input grid (`I`), filled with zeros.
2. **Iteration:** Loop through each cell in the input grid (`I`) using nested loops for rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).
3. **Copy:** Copy the current cell value (`val`) from the input grid to the corresponding location in the output grid (`O`).
4. **Transformation:** If the current cell value is '1' and it's not the last cell in the row, change the value of the cell to its right in the output grid to '2'. 
5. **Return:** Return the transformed output grid (`O`).

**Version 2 (Functional Approach with `apply`):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def transform_row(row):
        return tuple(TWO if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == ONE and row[j + 1] == ZERO else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
    return tuple(apply(transform_row, I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`transform_row` Function:** Defines a function that takes a row as input and applies the transformation rule to each cell within that row. If a cell is '1' and its right neighbor is '0', the right neighbor is changed to '2'.
2. **`apply` Function:** The `apply` function is used to apply the `transform_row` function to each row of the input grid (`I`).
3. **Return:** The transformed grid, where each row has been modified according to the transformation rule, is returned.

**Version 3 (Functional Approach with `ofcolor` and `sfilter`):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Find all '1' cells
  potential_twos = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)  # Get potential '2' locations
  valid_twos = sfilter(potential_twos, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))  # Keep valid locations
  O = I  # Start with the original grid
  for i, j in valid_twos:
    O = fill(O, TWO, (i, j))  # Fill valid '2' locations
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' Cells:**  Find the indices of all cells containing '1' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Generate Potential '2' Locations:** Calculate the indices of cells that would be to the right of the '1' cells, representing potential locations for '2'.
3. **Filter Valid Locations:** Use `sfilter` to keep only the potential '2' locations that fall within the grid's boundaries.
4. **Fill '2' Locations:** Iterate through the valid locations and use `fill` to change the corresponding cells in the grid to '2'. 

**Version 4 (Using `papply` and Conditional Logic):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(tuple(TWO if 0 <= j < w - 1 and I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Iterate and Transform:** This version directly iterates through the grid using nested list comprehensions and applies the transformation logic within the loop. 
2. **Conditional Filling:** The `TWO if ... else I[i][j]` statement checks if the current cell is '1' and its right neighbor is '0' and fills it with '2' if true, otherwise keeps the original value.

**Version 5 (Combining `hconcat` and  List Comprehensions):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(hconcat((tuple(v if j == len(row)-1 or row[j+1] != ZERO else branch(v == ONE, TWO, v) for j, v in enumerate(row[:-1])),), ((row[-1],),)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Rows:**  Iterates through each row of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Process Row Except Last Element:**  For each row, process all elements except the last one. For each element `v` in the row, it checks if it is the second to last element or if the next element is not zero. If either condition is true, it keeps the original value `v`. If both conditions are false (meaning it's not the second to last element and the next element is zero), it applies the transformation logic: if `v` is ONE, it changes it to TWO, otherwise keeps it as `v`.
3. **Concatenate Last Element:** Concatenates the processed row (without the last element) with the last element of the original row using `hconcat`.
4. **Return Transformed Grid:** Returns the transformed grid as a tuple of tuples.
