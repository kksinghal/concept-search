## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected groups of the same digit) consisting of the digit '1' and placing a '2' to the right of each '1' within the object, if the position is empty (contains a '0').

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- Two objects of '1' are present.
- In the top object, a '2' is placed to the right of the second '1'.
- In the bottom object, a '2' is placed to the right of the first '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
-  Similar to Input_0, '2's are placed to the right of each '1' in all objects formed by '1's if the position is empty.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Same logic applied as in the previous examples.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(
    product(ofcolor(I, 1), {RIGHT}),
    lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0
  )))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **`product(..., {RIGHT})`:** Generates a set of potential locations for '2' by pairing each '1' index with the `RIGHT` offset.
3. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:** Filters the potential locations, keeping only those that:
   - Are within the grid boundaries.
   - Have the value '0' in the input grid.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Transforms the filtered indices into an object with the color '2'.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the generated object onto the input grid, effectively placing the '2's in the desired locations.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  shifted = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        shifted = fill(shifted, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return cellwise(I, shifted, 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shape(I)`:** Retrieves the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`canvas(0, (h, w))`:** Creates an empty grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with '0's.
3. **Nested loops:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
4. **`if I[i][j] == 1:`:** Checks if the current cell contains '1'.
5. **`fill(shifted, 2, {(i, j + 1)})`:** If the current cell is '1', fills the cell to the right in the `shifted` grid with '2'.
6. **`cellwise(I, shifted, 0)`:**  Combines the input grid and the `shifted` grid, prioritizing values from the input grid and using '0' as a fallback.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  candidates = mfilter(
    apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones),
    lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])
  )
  twos = sfilter(candidates, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, twos))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Retrieves the indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **`apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)`:** Shifts all indices one position to the right.
3. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:** Filters the shifted indices, keeping those within grid boundaries.
4. **`twos = sfilter(candidates, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)`:** Filters the candidates further, keeping only those where the corresponding cell in the input grid contains a '0'.
5. **`recolor(2, twos)`:** Converts the filtered indices into an object with the color '2'.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the generated object onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, 
                         frozenset((i, j + 1) 
                                   for i, row in enumerate(I) 
                                   for j, val in enumerate(row[:-1]) 
                                   if val == 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested loop with conditionals:** Iterates through each cell (except the last column) of the input grid and checks if the cell contains a '1' and its right neighbor contains a '0'. 
2. **Set comprehension:** Creates a set of tuples representing the coordinates where '2's should be placed.
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Converts the set of coordinates into an object with the color '2'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the generated object onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objects_of_ones = objects(I, True, False, False)
  new_objects = set()
  for obj in objects_of_ones:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j+1)) == 0:
        new_objects.add((2, (i, j+1)))
  return paint(I, frozenset(new_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid where cells are connected horizontally or vertically and have the same value.
2. **Iterate through objects and cells:** Loops through each object and its cells.
3. **Conditional check:** Checks if the cell to the right is within grid boundaries and contains '0'.
4. **`new_objects.add((2, (i, j+1)))`:**  If the conditions are met, adds the coordinates of the right cell with color '2' to `new_objects`.
5. **`paint(I, frozenset(new_objects))`:** Paints the new objects onto the input grid.


These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, leveraging different DSL functions and logic combinations. Each version analyzes the input grid, identifies the relevant locations based on the specified criteria, and modifies the grid accordingly to generate the output.
