## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by the digit '1' on a background of '0'. The goal is to identify cells directly to the right of each '1' object and change their values to '2'.

**Input 0:**

- There are two '1' objects. 
- For the top object, there is one cell to the right, which gets changed to '2'.
- For the bottom object, there are two cells to the right, both changing to '2'.

**Input 1:**

- The pattern repeats for multiple '1' objects, with each object having one or two cells to their right being changed.

**Input 2:**

-  This input further confirms the pattern, showcasing its application regardless of the object's position within the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT) # Shift all objects to the right
  O = I 
  for v, (i, j) in shifted:
    if v == 1 and index(I, (i, j)) == 0:  # Check for '1' in the shifted grid and '0' in the original
      O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)}) # Fill with '2' if condition met
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shifting:** The program shifts the entire input grid one cell to the right.
2. **Iteration:** It iterates over the shifted grid, checking for cells containing '1'.
3. **Conditional Filling:** If a '1' is found in the shifted grid AND the corresponding cell in the original grid is '0', the program fills that cell in the output grid with '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** The code identifies objects formed by the digit '1'.
2. **Neighbor Check:** For each cell within each object, it checks if the cell to its right exists and contains '0'.
3. **Conditional Filling:** If the condition is met, the program fills the cell to the right with '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the objects to the canvas
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, RIGHT) # Shift the object to the right
    for v, (i, j) in shifted_obj:
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 0:  # If the original grid has '0' at the shifted location
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)}) # Fill that location with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A blank canvas is created with the background color.
2. **Object Painting:**  The program paints identified objects onto the canvas.
3. **Shift and Fill:** It then shifts each object one cell to the right.  For each cell in the shifted object, if the original grid has '0' in that position, it fills it with '2' on the canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iteration:** This version directly iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Boundary and Value Check:** For each cell, it checks:
   - If the cell contains '1'.
   - If it's not on the rightmost edge of the grid.
   - If the cell to its right contains '0'.
3. **Conditional Filling:** If all conditions are met, the cell to the right is filled with '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for x, y in toindices(obj):
      if (x, y + 1) not in toindices(obj) and index(I, (x, y + 1)) is not None:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(x, y + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Indices:**  The program identifies objects and their corresponding cell indices.
2. **Right Cell Check:** For each cell within an object, it verifies if the cell to its right:
   - Is NOT part of the same object.
   - Is within the grid boundaries.
3. **Conditional Filling:** If both conditions are met, the cell to the right is filled with '2'.
