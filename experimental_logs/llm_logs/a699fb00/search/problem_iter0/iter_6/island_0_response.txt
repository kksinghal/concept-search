## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (contiguous regions of the same digit excluding the background color 0) and extending them to the right by one cell, but only if it doesn't result in merging two distinct objects.

* **Input_0:** The '1' objects are extended to the right by one cell.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, '1' objects are extended rightwards, except for the rightmost '1' in each object.
* **Input_2:** Same as Input_1. The transformation consistently applies to all examples. 

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five different versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  extension = frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for obj in objs for v, loc in obj if add(loc, RIGHT) not in toindices(merge(objs)))
  O = underfill(I, TWO, extension)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects()` to get a set of objects in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Extension:** For each object, we generate an extension cell to its right using `add(loc, RIGHT)`. However, we only include this extension if it doesn't collide with another object. This check is done using `add(loc, RIGHT) not in toindices(merge(objs))`.
3. **Fill the Grid:**  We use `underfill()` to fill the extension cells with the value '2' on the original input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_grid, fallback=ZERO)
  O = replace(O, ONE, TWO)
  O = asobject(O)
  O = frozenset((v, loc) for v, loc in O if loc not in toindices(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)) or v == ONE)
  return paint(I, O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Compare:** Shift the input grid one cell to the right and compare it cell-wise with the original grid. If the values match, keep the original value; otherwise, set it to 0.
2. **Replace and Filter:** Replace all occurrences of '1' with '2'. Then, filter out the cells where the new value is '2' but the original grid didn't have an object at that location.
3. **Paint the Result:** Paint the resulting object onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(I, frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for v, loc in asobject(I) if v == ONE and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Extension Points:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains '1' and its right neighbor is '0', mark it as an extension point.
2. **Paint Extensions:**  Paint the extension points with the value '2' directly onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for v, loc in obj:
      if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO and add(loc, RIGHT) not in toindices(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)):
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(loc, RIGHT))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** Iterate through each object and each cell within the object. If a cell's right neighbor is '0' and doesn't belong to another object, mark it for extension.
2. **Paint Iteratively:**  Paint the extension cells with the value '2' directly onto the grid in each iteration.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  extensions = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    for v, loc in obj:
      if add(loc, RIGHT) not in toindices(obj) and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO:
        extensions = extensions | {add(loc, RIGHT)}
  return fill(I, TWO, extensions)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Collect Extension Indices:** Iterate through each object and cell. If the right neighbor is '0' and doesn't belong to the same object, add its index to the `extensions` set.
2. **Fill Extensions:** Use `fill()` to paint all the collected extension indices with the value '2' on the original input grid. 

These five program versions offer different approaches to achieve the desired rightward extension of objects without merging, providing a range of solutions within the DSL's capabilities.
