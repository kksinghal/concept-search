## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by the digit '1' and involves adding a '2' to the right of each '1' if that position is currently a '0'. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:**  The '1's at (0,0), (0,2) and (3,3) get a '2' to their right. The '1' at (3,1) remains unchanged as there's another '1' to its right.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, all '1's get a '2' to their right unless blocked by another '1' or the grid edge.
* **Input_2:**  The pattern continues, demonstrating the rule applies consistently across different input grids.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1) # Find all indices with the value '1'
  right_neighbors = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones) # Calculate the indices of their right neighbors
  valid_neighbors = sfilter(right_neighbors, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0) # Filter for neighbors within the grid boundaries and containing '0'
  O = fill(I, 2, valid_neighbors) # Fill the valid neighbors with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` locates all cells containing '1'.
2. **Find Right Neighbors:**  `right_neighbors` calculates the indices immediately to the right of each '1'.
3. **Filter Valid Positions:**  `valid_neighbors` keeps only those right neighbors which are:
    - Within the grid's bounds.
    -  Currently occupied by a '0'.
4. **Fill with '2':** `O = fill(I, 2, valid_neighbors)` changes the value of valid neighbor cells to '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I): # Iterate over rows
    for j, val in enumerate(row): # Iterate over cells in each row
      if val == 1 and j + 1 < len(row) and I[i][j + 1] == 0: # Check for '1' followed by '0' within row
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)}) # Fill the '0' to the right with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** The code iterates directly through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Identify Pattern:**  It checks if the current cell is '1' and the cell to its right is within the grid and contains '0'. 
3. **Fill with '2':**  If the pattern is found, the '0' to the right is replaced with '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_right =  shift(asobject(I), (0,1)) # Shift the entire grid to the right
    filtered_obj = sfilter(shifted_right, lambda x: x[1][1] < len(I[0]) and  x[0] == 0) #Keep only shifted '0's within the grid
    indices_to_fill = toindices(filtered_obj) #Get the indices of these '0's
    return paint(I, recolor(2, indices_to_fill)) # Paint these indices with '2' on the original grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:**  Shifts the entire grid one position to the right.
2. **Filter Shifted '0's:**  Identifies the '0's in the shifted grid that were originally adjacent (on the right) to a '1'.
3. **Get Indices:** Obtains the original indices of these filtered '0's.
4. **Paint with '2':** Fills the identified indices with '2' on the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(product(ofcolor(I, 1), {RIGHT}), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Positions:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` locates all cells with '1'.
2. **Calculate Potential '2' Positions:** `product(..., {RIGHT})` generates the indices immediately to the right of each '1'.
3. **Filter Valid '2' Positions:**  `mfilter(...)` keeps only those right neighbors which are within the grid's bounds and contain '0'.
4. **Paint '2's:** `paint(..., recolor(2, ...))` fills the valid '2' positions with the value '2' on the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def check_and_fill(i, j):
    if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == 0: # Check if right neighbor is within bounds and is 0
      return (2, (i, j + 1))
    else:
      return (I[i][j], (i, j)) #Otherwise keep the original value

  return  asgrid(frozenset(check_and_fill(i,j)  for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0]))), shape(I)) # Apply check_and_fill to each cell and convert back to grid format
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:**  `check_and_fill(i, j)` checks for the '1'-'0' pattern at each cell and returns either the original cell or a modified cell with '2'.
2. **Apply to All Cells:**  The main function applies `check_and_fill` to all grid cells.
3. **Reconstruct Grid:** The results are then converted back into a grid format.

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the provided DSL.
