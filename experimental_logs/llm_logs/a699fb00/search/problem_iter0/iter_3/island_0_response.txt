## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background) and extending them to the right by one cell. However, the extension only occurs if the extended cell would be filled with the background color (most common color).

**Example:**

Consider Input_0:

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

The output extends the objects formed by '1' to the right by one cell:

```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Notice how the rightmost '1's in each object are not extended because they are not adjacent to a background cell.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  right_shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
  O = cellwise(I, paint(I, right_shifted_objs), fallback=ZERO)
  O = replace(O, ONE, TWO)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify objects in the input grid (`objs`).
2. Shift each object one cell to the right (`right_shifted_objs`).
3. Paint the shifted objects onto a copy of the original grid (`paint(I, right_shifted_objs)`).
4. Use `cellwise` to compare the original grid with the painted grid. If a cell matches in both grids, keep the original value. Otherwise, set it to `ZERO`.
5. Replace occurrences of `ONE` in the resulting grid with `TWO` to represent the extension.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  extension_indices = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if index(I, (i, j + 1)) == ZERO), objs)
  O = underfill(I, TWO, extension_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify objects in the input grid (`objs`).
2. For each object, calculate the indices of potential extension points (one cell to the right) if they are background cells (`extension_indices`).
3. Use `underfill` to fill the `extension_indices` with `TWO` on the original grid, effectively extending the objects.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if index(I, (i, j + 1)) == ZERO:
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterate through each object in the input grid.
2. For every cell in the object, check if the cell to the right is a background cell.
3. If it is, paint a `TWO` on that cell in the output grid (`O`), effectively extending the object.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  extended_objs = mapply(
      lambda obj: frozenset(
          (v, (i, j + 1)) if index(I, (i, j + 1)) == ZERO else (v, (i, j))
          for v, (i, j) in obj
      ),
      objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  )
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), extended_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify objects in the input grid.
2. For each cell in each object, check if the cell to the right is background. If so, shift the cell's coordinates one position to the right, essentially "extending" it.
3. Paint the extended objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_right, fallback=ZERO)
  O = replace(O, ONE, TWO)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Treat the entire input grid as a single object (`asobject(I)`).
2. Shift this object one cell to the right (`shifted_right`).
3. Use `cellwise` to compare the original grid with the shifted grid. Matching cells retain their original value. Otherwise, they are set to `ZERO`.
4. Replace all occurrences of `ONE` with `TWO` in the output grid, effectively highlighting the extended areas. 

These are just five examples, and many other variations are possible using different combinations of functions from the DSL. Each version approaches the problem slightly differently, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving this spatial reasoning task.
