## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background color '0') and inserting the digit '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects.  

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* There's one object formed by the '1' digits.
* In the output, a '2' is inserted to the right of each '1' within this object.

**Input_1:**

* This input features three distinct objects formed by '1' digits.
*  The output reflects the same pattern as Input_0, with a '2' inserted to the right of each '1' within each of the three objects.

**Input_2:**

* Similar to Input_1, we see multiple objects made of '1's.
* Again, the transformation consistently inserts a '2' to the right of each '1' within each object.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if v == 1:
        h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
        if j < w - 1:
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all connected regions of the same digit, excluding the background (0). 
2. **Iterate & Modify:** The program iterates through each object and its cells. If a cell contains '1', it fills the cell to its right with '2' if the cell exists within the grid boundaries.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, r in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(r):
      if v == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j)), (2, (i, j + 1))})
      elif v != 0:
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate & Paint:**  The program iterates through the input grid. If it finds a '1', it paints both the '1' and a '2' to its right onto the canvas.  Other non-zero digits are painted directly onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
  O = I
  for v, (i, j) in shifted:
    if index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 1:
      O = fill(O, v, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Right:** `shifted = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))` shifts the entire input grid one cell to the right.
2. **Iterate & Fill:** It then iterates through this shifted grid. If the cell's left neighbor in the original input was a '1', the current cell in the output is filled with the shifted value.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    shifted_indices = shift(indices, (0, 1))
    for (i, j), (si, sj) in zip(indices, shifted_indices):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 1 and 0 <= si < len(I) and 0 <= sj < len(I[0]):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(si, sj)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects and Shift:** Similar to version 1, it identifies objects. Then, it shifts the indices of each object to the right.
2. **Conditional Fill:** It iterates through original and shifted indices, filling the shifted index with '2' if the original index holds a '1' and the shifted index is within the grid boundaries. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  def modify_row(row):
    new_row = []
    for i, v in enumerate(row):
      if i > 0 and row[i-1] == 1 and v == 0:
        new_row.extend([1, 2])
      else:
        new_row.append(v)
    return tuple(new_row)
  return tuple(modify_row(r) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Modification:**  This version processes the grid row by row.
2. **Insert '2':**  For each cell, it checks if the previous cell was a '1' and the current cell is '0'. If true, it inserts both '1' and '2'. 
   
These five program versions provide different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
