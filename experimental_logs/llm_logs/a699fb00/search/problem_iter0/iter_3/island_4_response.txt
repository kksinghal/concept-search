## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with the value `1` and placing a `2` to their immediate right, as long as that cell is within the grid's boundaries.

**Input-Output Pair Examples:**

- **Input_0:** The `1` at (0,0) results in a `2` at (0,1). Similarly, the `1`s at (0,2), (3,1), and (3,3) produce `2`s in their respective adjacent cells.
- **Input_1 & Input_2:** The same logic applies, with `2`s placed only where a `1` exists to their left and within the grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL to accomplish this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Find indices of all '1' cells
  shifted_right = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)  # Calculate indices of right neighbors
  valid_neighbors = sfilter(shifted_right, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))  # Filter out-of-bounds indices
  O = fill(I, TWO, valid_neighbors)  # Fill valid neighbor cells with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells containing the value `1`.
2. **`shifted_right = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)`:** Shifts each identified index one position to the right.
3. **`valid_neighbors = sfilter(shifted_right, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))`:**  Filters the shifted indices, keeping only those that fall within the grid's boundaries.
4. **`O = fill(I, TWO, valid_neighbors)`:** Fills the cells at the valid neighbor indices with the value `2`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)  # Shift the entire grid right
  common = intersection(asobject(I), shifted)  # Find overlapping cells
  valid_common = sfilter(common, lambda x: x[0] == 1 and 0 <= x[1][1] < len(I[0]) - 1)  # Keep valid overlaps with '1'
  O = fill(I, TWO, mapply(lambda x: (x[1][0], x[1][1] + 1), valid_common))  # Fill cells to the right of valid overlaps 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)`:**  Shifts the entire grid representation one cell to the right.
2. **`common = intersection(asobject(I), shifted)`:** Finds the overlapping cells between the original and shifted grid representations.
3. **`valid_common = sfilter(common, lambda x: x[0] == 1 and 0 <= x[1][1] < len(I[0]) - 1)`:** Filters for overlapping cells where the original cell value is `1` and ensures the target cell is within bounds.
4. **`O = fill(I, TWO, mapply(lambda x: (x[1][0], x[1][1] + 1), valid_common))`:** Fills the cell to the right of each valid overlapping cell with `2`. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Initialize output grid with zeros
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            O = fill(O, val, (i, j))  # Copy original value
            if val == ONE and j < len(row) - 1:
                O = fill(O, TWO, (i, j + 1))  # Fill right neighbor with '2' if within bounds
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:** Creates an output grid filled with `0`s, matching the input grid's dimensions.
2. **`for i, row in enumerate(I): ...`:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **`O = fill(O, val, (i, j))`:** Copies the original cell value to the corresponding position in the output grid.
4. **`if val == ONE and j < len(row) - 1: ...`:** Checks if the current cell is `1` and has a valid right neighbor.
5. **`O = fill(O, TWO, (i, j + 1))`:** If the conditions are met, fills the right neighbor with `2`. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == ONE else val 
          for j, val in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. This program uses nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation directly.
2. **`for row in I`:** Iterates over each row of the input grid.
3. **`for j, val in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates over each cell within the current row.
4. **`TWO if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == ONE else val`:** Checks if the current cell is a `1` and has a valid right neighbor. If so, it places a `2`; otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Get indices of '1' cells
  potential_twos = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)  # Generate potential '2' locations
  valid_twos = sfilter(potential_twos, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))  # Filter valid locations
  O = I  # Start with the original grid
  for i, j in valid_twos:
    O = fill(O, TWO, (i, j))  # Fill valid '2' locations
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Finds the indices of all cells containing the value `1`.
2. **`potential_twos = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)`:** Calculates the indices of potential `2` locations (right neighbors of `1`s).
3. **`valid_twos = sfilter(potential_twos, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))`:** Filters out invalid locations that fall outside the grid boundaries.
4. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
5. **`for i, j in valid_twos: ...`:** Iterates through each valid `2` location.
6. **`O = fill(O, TWO, (i, j))`:**  Fills each valid location in the output grid with a `2`.
