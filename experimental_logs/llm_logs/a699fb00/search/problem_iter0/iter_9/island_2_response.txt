## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation adds a '2' to the right of each '1' in the input grid if that position is within the grid bounds and is not already occupied by a '1'. This transformation can be described as adding a "shadow" or "outline" to the objects formed by the '1's in the input. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 0 1 
0 1 0 
0 0 1
```

Output:
```
1 2 1
0 1 2
0 0 1
```


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if I[i][j] == ONE and j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly iterates through the input grid (`I`). For each cell, it checks if the cell contains a '1', if the right neighbor is within the grid bounds (`j + 1 < len(I[0])`), and if the right neighbor is a '0' (`I[i][j + 1] == ZERO`). If all conditions are true, it places a '2' in the output grid at that cell's position; otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(I, RIGHT)  
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if I[i][j] == ONE and j < len(I[0]) - 1 and shifted[i][j] == ZERO else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `shift` function to create a copy of the input grid shifted one position to the right (`shifted`). It then iterates through both the original and shifted grids simultaneously. If a cell in the original grid contains a '1' and its corresponding cell in the shifted grid is a '0', a '2' is placed in the output grid. This approach avoids nested loops for checking neighbors.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (v, (i, j + 1)) not in obj:
                O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `objects` function to identify connected regions of '1's in the input grid. For each object, it iterates through its cells and checks if the right neighbor is within bounds and not part of the same object. If so, it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with '2'. This approach directly leverages the concept of objects and their boundaries.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
        if j + 1 < len(I[0]):
          O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version initializes an output grid filled with '0's. It then iterates through the input grid. If it encounters a '1', it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with '1' and, if within bounds, fills the cell to the right with '2'. This approach explicitly constructs the output grid based on the input's '1' positions.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if I[i][j] == ZERO and j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == ONE else I[i][j]
            for j in range(len(I[0]))
        )
        for i in range(len(I))
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the input grid and checks for each '0' if its left neighbor is a '1'. If that's the case and within grid bounds, it places a '2' in the output grid; otherwise, it keeps the original cell value. This approach flips the logic of the first version and fills '2's based on the left neighbor instead of the right neighbor.
