## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1's) and extending them to the right by one cell, but only if that cell is currently the background color (most common color).

**Input_0:**
- There are two objects, one in the top left and one in the bottom left.
- Both objects are extended to the right by one cell, filling in a '0' with a '2'.

**Input_1:**
- There are four objects.
- The top left, top right, and bottom left objects are extended to the right by one cell.
- The bottom right object is not extended because the cell to its right is not a '0'.

**Input_2:**
- There are five objects.
- All objects except the bottom right object are extended to the right by one cell. 

## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):**

```python
def extend_objects_right(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  extended_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if index(I, (i, j+1)) == bg:
        extended_objs.add((i, j+1))
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, loc) for loc in extended_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` finds all objects (connected '1's).
2. **Get background color:** `bg = mostcolor(I)` finds the most common color, representing the background.
3. **Find extension points:** Iterate through each object's cells. If the cell to the right is the background color, add its coordinates to `extended_objs`.
4. **Paint extensions:** Paint the `extended_objs` onto the original grid with color '2'.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):**

```python
def extend_objects_right(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, (i, j+1)) for obj in objs for i, j in toindices(obj) if index(I, (i, j+1)) == bg))
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same result as version 1 but condenses the logic into a single `paint` function call. It directly iterates through object cells and checks for extension possibility within the `paint` function arguments.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):**

```python
def extend_objects_right(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, (i, j+1)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 1 and j+1 < len(row) and row[j+1] == mostcolor(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the process by directly iterating over the grid cells instead of identifying objects. It checks for a '1' and its right neighbor being the background color to paint the extension.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):**

```python
def extend_objects_right(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and val == mostcolor(I) else val for j, val in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses list comprehension for a more compact and Pythonic approach. It iterates through each row and cell, checking for a '1' to the left and the background color at the current position for extension.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):**

```python
def extend_objects_right(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in shifted if v == 1 and index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `shift` function to create a shifted copy of the grid. It then iterates through this shifted grid, identifying original '1's now positioned at their potential extension points and checking if the original grid holds the background color at that location.
