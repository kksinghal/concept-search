## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and extending them to the right by one cell, but only if the cell to the right is currently the background color (assumed to be 0). 

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Object Identification:** The program needs to identify individual objects within the input grid. Objects are defined as connected regions of the same digit. 
* **Rightward Extension:** Each identified object should be extended one cell to the right. 
* **Background Condition:** The extension should only occur if the cell to the right of the object's rightmost cell is the background color.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program in the DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return underfill(I, TWO, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO and index(I, loc) != ZERO)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO and index(I, loc) != ZERO)`:** This part identifies the indices of cells that should be extended. It iterates through all indices of the grid (`asindices(I)`) and checks if the cell to the right (`add(loc, RIGHT)`) is the background color (`ZERO`) and the current cell is not background.
2. **`underfill(I, TWO, ...)`:**  This takes the original grid (`I`), the value to fill with (`TWO`), and the previously identified indices. It fills the specified indices with `TWO` only if they were originally the background color.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((TWO, add(loc, RIGHT)) for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) for v, loc in obj if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** This identifies all objects in the input grid (`I`). 
2. **`for v, loc in obj if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO`:** This iterates over each cell (`loc`) within each object, but only considers cells where the cell to the right is the background color.
3. **`(TWO, add(loc, RIGHT))`:**  For the selected cells, a new cell with the value `TWO` is created at the location to the right of the current cell.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Finally, the `paint` function takes the original grid and the set of newly created cells and paints them onto the grid. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, shift(fill(I, ZERO, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ZERO)), RIGHT), fallback=ZERO)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill(I, ZERO, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ZERO))`:** This part creates a copy of the input grid and fills all background cells with a temporary value different from `ZERO` (we cannot use `TWO` as it might be present in the input).
2. **`shift(..., RIGHT)`:** This shifts the modified grid one cell to the right.
3. **`cellwise(I, ..., fallback=ZERO)`:** This compares the original grid with the shifted grid. If the corresponding cells have the same value (meaning the original cell was not background), it keeps the original value. If they are different (meaning the original cell was background and the shifted cell is the extended object), it sets the cell to `TWO`. Otherwise, it sets the cell to `ZERO`.

**Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if index(I, add(urcorner(obj), RIGHT)) == ZERO:
      O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(urcorner(obj), RIGHT))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:**  Iterates over each object in the input grid.
2. **`if index(I, add(urcorner(obj), RIGHT)) == ZERO`:** Checks if the cell to the right of the object's upper-right corner is the background color.
3. **`O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(urcorner(obj), RIGHT))})`:** If the condition is met, it paints a new cell with the value `TWO` to the right of the object's upper-right corner.

**Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((TWO, add((i, rightmost(obj)), RIGHT)) for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) if index(I, add((i, rightmost(obj)), RIGHT)) == ZERO))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:**  Iterates over each object.
2. **`for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)`:** Iterates through each row where the object is present.
3. **`if index(I, add((i, rightmost(obj)), RIGHT)) == ZERO`:**  Checks if the cell to the right of the object's rightmost cell in the current row is background. 
4. **`(TWO, add((i, rightmost(obj)), RIGHT))`:** If the condition is met, it creates a new cell with the value `TWO` at that location.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the new cells onto the original grid. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the DSL. Each version utilizes a different set of functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
