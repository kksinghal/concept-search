## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects comprised of '1's in the input grid and adding a '2' to the right of each '1'. The process can be broken down as follows:

**For each '1' in the input grid:**

1. **Check if the cell to the right is empty (contains '0').**
2. **If empty, change the '0' to a '2'.**

Let's visualize this with Input_0:

**Input_0:**

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

**Output_0:**

```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

As you can see, for each '1' in the input grid, a '2' is placed in the cell immediately to its right in the output grid, only if that cell was initially a '0'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:


### **Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_neighbors = mapply(lambda loc: astuple(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)
  filtered_neighbors = sfilter(right_neighbors, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)
  O = fill(I, 2, filtered_neighbors)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Finds the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **`right_neighbors = mapply(lambda loc: astuple(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)`:** Calculates the index of the right neighbor for each '1'.
3. **`filtered_neighbors = sfilter(right_neighbors, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)`:** Filters the right neighbors, keeping only those that are within the grid boundaries and contain '0'.
4. **`O = fill(I, 2, filtered_neighbors)`:** Fills the filtered neighbor cells with '2'. 
5. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid.

### **Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_ones = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objects(I, True, False, False))
  O = cellwise(I, underpaint(I, recolor(2, shifted_ones)), 0) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_ones = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objects(I, True, False, False))`**: This line first identifies all the objects formed by connected '1's and then shifts each of these objects one cell to the right. 
2. **`O = cellwise(I, underpaint(I, recolor(2, shifted_ones)), 0)`**: This line combines three operations:
    -  `recolor(2, shifted_ones)`: Changes the color of the shifted objects to '2'.
    -  `underpaint(I, ...)`:  Paints the recolored objects onto the original grid (I) only where the original grid has '0's.
    -  `cellwise(I, ..., 0)`: Compares the underpainted grid with the original grid and retains the '2's from the underpainted grid while keeping the rest of the cells as they were in the original grid. 


### **Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i,j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate through each cell in the grid (except the last column):**
   -  **`if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0`:** If the current cell contains a '1' and its right neighbor contains a '0':
      -  **`O = fill(O, 2, {(i,j+1)})`:** Fill the right neighbor cell with a '2' in the output grid.
3. **`return O`:** Returns the modified output grid.

### **Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_shifted = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1]+1), ones)
  valid_shifts = sfilter(right_shifted, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))
  O = I
  for i, j in valid_shifts:
    if I[i][j] == 0:
      O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Get the indices of all '1's in the grid.
2. **`right_shifted = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1]+1), ones)`:** Calculate the indices of cells to the right of each '1'.
3. **`valid_shifts = sfilter(right_shifted, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))`:** Filter out indices that fall outside the grid boundaries.
4. **`O = I`:** Initialize output as a copy of input.
5. **Iterate through the valid shifted indices:** 
   - **`if I[i][j] == 0`:** If the cell at the shifted index contains '0' in the input grid:
     - **`O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})`:** Fill that cell with '2' in the output grid.
6. **`return O`:** Return the modified output grid.


### **Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_right_if_zero(loc):
    i, j = loc
    if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
      return {(i, j + 1)}
    return {} 
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 2, shift_right_if_zero((i, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift_right_if_zero(loc)` function:** 
   - Takes a location `(i, j)` as input.
   - Checks if the cell to the right is within the grid bounds and contains a '0'.
   - If so, returns the index of the right cell as a set. Otherwise, returns an empty set.
2. **`O = I`:** Initialize output as a copy of input.
3. **Iterate through each cell in the grid:**
   - **`if I[i][j] == 1`:** If the cell contains a '1':
      - **`O = fill(O, 2, shift_right_if_zero((i, j)))`:** Call `shift_right_if_zero` to potentially get the index of the cell to the right and fill it with a '2' in the output grid.
4. **`return O`:** Return the modified output grid.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
