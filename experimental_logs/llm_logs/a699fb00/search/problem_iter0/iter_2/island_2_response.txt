## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by adjacent '1's in the input grid and then placing a '2' to the right of each '1' if that position is empty (contains a '0').

**Example:**

Input:

```
1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
```

Output:

```
1 2 1 0
0 1 2 0
0 0 1 2 
```

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify objects formed by adjacent '1's
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, TWO, shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT)) # Shift object indices right and fill with '2' if empty
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use the `objects` function to identify contiguous groups of '1's in the input grid.
2. **Iterate through objects:** For each identified object:
    - **Shift indices right:** The `shift` function moves the object's indices one position to the right.
    - **Underfill with '2':** The `underfill` function fills the shifted positions with '2' only if they originally contain a '0'.
3. **Return modified grid:**  The function returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Get indices of all '1's
  fill_indices = mfilter(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1) in asindices(I) and I[loc[0]][loc[1] + 1] == ZERO, ones) # Filter for valid right neighbors
  return fill(I, TWO, fill_indices) # Fill '2' at valid right neighbor indices
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' indices:** We use the `ofcolor` function to get the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Filter valid neighbors:** The `mfilter` function iterates through the '1' indices and keeps only those whose right neighbor is within the grid and contains a '0'.
3. **Fill with '2':** The `fill` function places a '2' at each index identified in the previous step.
4. **Return modified grid:**  The function returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, shift(fill(I, ONE, asindices(I)), RIGHT), I) # Shift a filled grid right and use cellwise comparison to determine fill locations.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create filled grid:** We use the `fill` function to create a temporary grid where all cells are replaced with '1's.
2. **Shift filled grid:** The `shift` function moves the filled grid one position to the right.
3. **Cellwise comparison:** We use the `cellwise` function to compare the original grid with the shifted filled grid. For each cell, if both grids have a '1' at that position, it means the original grid had a '1' and its right neighbor was empty. In this case, the `cellwise` function will output a '2'. Otherwise, it retains the original value from the input grid.
4. **Return modified grid:**  The function returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO:
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j + 1)}) # Directly iterate and fill right neighbors
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** We use nested loops to iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for condition:** For each cell, we check if it contains a '1' and if its right neighbor is within the grid and contains a '0'.
3. **Fill with '2':** If the condition is met, we use the `fill` function to replace the right neighbor's value with a '2'.
4. **Return modified grid:**  The function returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify objects formed by adjacent '1's
  fill_indices =  set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if (i, j + 1) in asindices(I) and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO:
        fill_indices.add((i, j + 1))
  return fill(I, TWO, frozenset(fill_indices)) # Collect fill indices and apply fill function once.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use the `objects` function to find groups of adjacent '1's.
2. **Collect fill indices:** For each object, we iterate through its indices and check if its right neighbor is within the grid and contains a '0'. If so, we add the neighbor's index to a set `fill_indices`.
3. **Fill with '2':** After processing all objects, we use the `fill` function to place a '2' at all collected indices in `fill_indices`.
4. **Return modified grid:**  The function returns the modified grid.

These five program versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version might have different performance characteristics depending on the specific implementation of the DSL functions.
