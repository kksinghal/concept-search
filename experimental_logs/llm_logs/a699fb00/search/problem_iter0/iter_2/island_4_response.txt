## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects made of the digit '1' to the right by one cell, filling the new cell with the digit '2'. 

**Let's break it down for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The two single-cell '1' objects are extended to the right. The top-right corner cell remains unchanged as there is no '1' object to its left.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** All '1' objects, regardless of their position or size, are extended to the right. Again, cells on the right edge remain unchanged if there's no '1' object to their left.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:**  The transformation applies consistently to all input grids.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) # Find all objects made of '1's
    extensions = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT), objs) # Shift each object one cell to the right
    valid_extensions = sfilter(extensions, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])) # Keep only valid shifts (within grid boundaries)
    O = fill(I, TWO, merge(valid_extensions)) # Fill the valid shift locations with '2's
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all connected components of '1's in the grid.
2. **Shift right:** `mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT), objs)` shifts each object one cell to the right.
3. **Validate shifts:**  `sfilter(extensions, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))` ensures we only keep shifted cells within the grid's horizontal boundaries.
4. **Fill with '2's:** `fill(I, TWO, merge(valid_extensions))` fills the valid shifted locations with the digit '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT) # Shift the entire grid one cell to the right
    intersection = toindices(intersection(asobject(I), shifted_right)) # Find overlapping cells between original and shifted grids
    valid_intersection = sfilter(intersection, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])) # Keep only valid overlapping cells (within grid boundaries)
    O = fill(I, TWO, shift(valid_intersection, RIGHT)) # Fill the cells to the right of valid overlaps with '2's
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift grid right:** `shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)` shifts the entire grid one cell to the right.
2. **Find overlaps:** `toindices(intersection(asobject(I), shifted_right))` finds the cells that overlap between the original and shifted grids. These overlaps represent cells that had a '1' to their left.
3. **Validate overlaps:** `sfilter(intersection, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))` keeps only valid overlapping cells within the grid boundaries.
4. **Fill right neighbors:**  `fill(I, TWO, shift(valid_intersection, RIGHT))` fills the cells immediately to the right of the valid overlapping cells with '2's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j]==1:
        O = fill(O,TWO,(i,j+1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for '1':** If a cell contains the value '1', it proceeds.
3. **Fill right neighbor:** The cell to the right of the current cell (j+1) is filled with '2'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Get indices of all '1' cells
  right_neighbors = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)  # Calculate indices of right neighbors
  valid_neighbors = sfilter(right_neighbors, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])) # Filter out out-of-bounds indices
  O = fill(I, TWO, valid_neighbors) # Fill valid neighbor cells with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' cells:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` gets the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Calculate right neighbors:** `mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)` calculates the indices of the cells immediately to the right of each '1'.
3. **Validate neighbors:** `sfilter(right_neighbors, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))` ensures only valid indices within the grid boundaries are kept.
4. **Fill with '2's:** `fill(I, TWO, valid_neighbors)` fills the valid neighbor cells with the digit '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j < len(row)-1 and row[j] == 1 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and modify rows:** This program iterates through each row and modifies them using nested list comprehensions.
2. **Check and replace:** For each cell in a row, it checks if the cell contains '1' and if it's not the last cell in the row. If both conditions are true, it replaces the cell with '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original value ('v'). 


Each of these program versions accomplishes the same goal of extending '1' objects to the right with a '2', but they achieve this using different logic and DSL function combinations, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
