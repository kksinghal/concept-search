## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following rule:

**For each object (connected group of the same digit excluding the background digit which is 0) in the input grid:**

1. **Identify** the cells directly adjacent (horizontally and vertically) to the object's cells.
2. **Fill** these adjacent cells with the digit '2', but only if they were initially the background digit (0).

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The object consisting of '1's has adjacent cells filled with '2'.
* **Input_1 & Input_2:** The same logic applies; cells directly next to the '1' objects are filled with '2' if they were previously '0'. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program utilizing different DSL functions:

**Version 1:** (Using `delta` and direct iteration)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify objects, no diagonals, without background
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    border = delta(toindices(obj)) # Get the border indices
    O = underfill(O, 2, border) # Fill the border with '2' if it was background
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects from the input grid (`I`), considering only directly connected cells (`T`), ignoring diagonals (`F`), and excluding the background (`T`).
2. **Iterate through `objs`:** For each object:
   - **`delta(toindices(obj))`:**  Gets the indices of cells surrounding the object (its border).
   - **`underfill(O, 2, border)`:** Fills the border cells with '2' only if they were originally the background digit (0). 
3. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid.

**Version 2:** (Using `neighbors` and set operations)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    border = set()
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      border |= neighbors((i, j))  # Add neighboring indices to border
    border -= toindices(obj)  # Remove object's own indices
    O = underfill(O, 2, border)  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects as in Version 1.
2. **Iterate through `objs`:** For each object:
   - **Initialize `border`:**  An empty set to store border indices.
   - **Inner loop:** For each cell in the object:
      - **`neighbors((i, j))`:**  Gets indices of neighboring cells.
      - **`border |= ...`:** Adds the neighboring indices to the `border` set.
   - **`border -= toindices(obj)`:** Removes the object's own indices from the `border` set.
   - **`underfill(O, 2, border)`:**  Fills border cells with '2' if they were background.
3. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Version 3:** (Functional approach using `apply`, `merge`, and `difference`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return underfill(
      I,
      2,
      difference(
          merge(apply(lambda cell: neighbors(cell[1]), obj)) for obj in objs),
          merge(apply(toindices, objs))
      )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects.
2. **Nested `apply` calls:** 
   - **`apply(toindices, objs)`:**  Converts all objects to their cell indices.
   - **`apply(lambda cell: neighbors(cell[1]), obj)` (inner):** For each object, gets neighboring indices for each of its cells using a lambda function.
   - **`merge(...)` (outer):** Merges all neighboring indices from all objects.
3. **`difference(...)`:** Removes the original object indices from the merged neighboring indices, leaving only the border. 
4. **`underfill(I, 2, ...)`:** Fills the border cells with '2' if they were background.

**Version 4:** (Leveraging `backdrop` and `difference`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, 2, difference(backdrop(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects.
2. **Iterate through `objs`:**
   - **`backdrop(toindices(obj))`:**  Gets indices of all cells within the object's bounding box.
   - **`difference(..., toindices(obj))`:** Removes the object's own indices, leaving the border.
   - **`underfill(O, 2, ...)`:**  Fills border cells with '2' if they were background.
3. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid.

**Version 5:** (Combined `apply` and `difference`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return underfill(
      I,
      2,
      difference(
          merge(apply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), objs)),
          merge(apply(toindices, objs))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), objs)`:**  Gets bounding box indices for each object.
3. **`merge(...)` (outer):**  Merges all bounding box indices.
4. **`merge(apply(toindices, objs))`:**  Gets and merges all object cell indices. 
5. **`difference(...)`:** Removes object indices from bounding box indices, leaving the border.
6. **`underfill(I, 2, ...)`:** Fills border cells with '2' if they were background.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same result, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL and the ability to solve the problem in diverse ways.
