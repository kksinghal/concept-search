## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1's) in the input grid and extending them one cell to the right with the value '2'. 

Here's a breakdown by input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**
- The top-left '1' is extended to the right, becoming '1 2'. 
- The bottom '1 1' becomes '0 1 2 1 0'.

**Pair 1:** 
- Every horizontal '1...1' sequence in the input is replaced with '1...1 2' in the output.

**Pair 2:** 
- Similar to previous pairs, horizontal '1...1' sequences are extended rightward with a '2'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:


**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if (j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == ONE) else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**
- This program iterates through each row and cell of the input grid.
- For each cell containing '1', it checks if the next cell in the row also contains '1'.
- If true, it places a '2' to the right of the current '1'.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(TWO, (i, j + 1))}) | obj for obj in objs for _, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1}))
```

**Explanation:**
- Identifies objects (connected '1's) in the grid using `objects`.
- For each object, it adds a new cell with value '2' to the right of each of its cells if it's not on the right edge of the grid.
- Finally, it paints these extended objects back onto the original grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if any(I[i][k] == ONE for k in range(j, min(len(row), j + 2))) and I[i][j] != ONE
            else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**
- Iterates through rows and cells of the input grid.
- For each cell, it checks if the cell or the next cell contains '1' and the current cell is not '1'.
- If true, it replaces the current cell with a '2'.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if (j > 0 and row[j-1] == ONE) else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**
- This program iterates through each row and cell of the input grid.
- For each cell, it checks if the previous cell in the row contains '1'.
- If true, it replaces the current cell with '2'.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if (j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == ONE) or (j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == ONE) else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**
- Iterates through rows and cells of the input grid.
- For each cell, it checks if the previous cell or the next cell contains '1'.
- If true, it replaces the current cell with a '2'. 

These programs represent a diverse set of approaches to solve the given transformation task within the constraints of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL in expressing the desired transformation.
