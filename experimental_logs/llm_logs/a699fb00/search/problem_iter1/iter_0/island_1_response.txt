## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid and adding a '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects. 

Let's break down the transformation for each example:

**Input_0:**

* **Object:** A single object formed by the '1's. 
* **Transformation:** A '2' is added to the right of each '1' within this object.

**Input_1:**

* **Objects:** Three distinct objects formed by the '1's.
* **Transformation:**  A '2' is added to the right of each '1' within each of these objects.

**Input_2:**

* **Objects:** Four distinct objects formed by the '1's.
* **Transformation:**  A '2' is added to the right of each '1' within each of these objects.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for value, (i, j) in obj:
      if value == ONE and j < width(I) - 1:
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies objects (connected components of '1's) in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** The code iterates through each object and its cells.
3. **Conditional Fill:** If a cell contains '1' and isn't on the right edge, it fills the cell to its right with '2'.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_I = fill(I, TWO, shift(ofcolor(I, ONE), RIGHT))
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_I, fallback=ZERO)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Indices:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Shift and Fill:**  These indices are shifted right (`shift(..., RIGHT)`), and a new grid `shifted_I` is created by filling these shifted indices in the original grid with '2'.
3. **Combine Grids:** `cellwise(I, shifted_I, fallback=ZERO)` combines the original grid and `shifted_I`. It keeps '2's from `shifted_I` where they overlap with '1's in the original grid and uses '0' otherwise.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == ONE and j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO:
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:**  This version directly iterates through the grid, row by row, and cell by cell.
2. **Conditional Fill:**  If a cell contains a '1', is not on the rightmost edge, and its right neighbor is '0', it fills the right neighbor with '2'.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      O = fill(O, value, {(i, j)})
      if value == ONE and j < len(row) - 1:
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Grid:** An empty grid `O` of the same size as the input is created.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates through the input grid and copies each cell value to the corresponding position in `O`. If the value is '1' and not on the right edge, it fills the cell to the right in `O` with '2'.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
        if j < w - 1:
          O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Grid:** An empty grid `O` is created with the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The code iterates through the input grid. If it encounters a '1', it fills the corresponding cell in `O` with '1'. If this '1' is not on the right edge, it fills the cell to the right in `O` with '2'.
