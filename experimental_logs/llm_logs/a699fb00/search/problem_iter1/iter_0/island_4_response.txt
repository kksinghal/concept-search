## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by adjacent cells of the same digit (excluding the background digit, which is the most frequent one) and then inserting a cell with digit '2' to the right of each object cell if it's empty. 

Let's analyze this for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

* Two objects are present, formed by digit '1'.
* For both objects, a '2' is inserted to the right of each '1' cell if the cell is empty.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

* Five objects are present, formed by digit '1'.
*  '2's are inserted to the right of each '1' cell within these objects if the cell is empty.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

* Five objects are present, formed by digit '1'.
*  '2's are inserted to the right of each '1' cell within these objects if the cell is empty.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
                I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies objects in the input grid `I`. `T, F, T` specifies that objects are formed by cells with the same value (`T`), not considering diagonals (`F`), and excluding the background color (`T`).
2. **`for obj in objs:`**: Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`for v, (i, j) in obj:`**: Iterates through each cell `(i, j)` with value `v` within the current object.
4. **`if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):`**: Checks if the cell to the right is within the grid boundaries and contains the background color.
5. **`I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})`**: Fills the cell to the right with '2'.
6. **`return I`**: Returns the modified grid.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(v, (i, j)) if j == jj else (2, (i, j)) for jj in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1) if (v != mostcolor(I) or j != jj) and 0 <= j < len(I[0])}) for v, (i, j) in obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more functional approach, achieving the transformation within a single line of code:

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies objects in the grid excluding the background color.
2. **`for v, (i, j) in obj for obj in ...`**: Iterates each cell of each object.
3. **`for jj in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)`**: Iterates through column indices within the object's bounding box.
4. **`(v != mostcolor(I) or j != jj) and 0 <= j < len(I[0])`**:  Ensures that only non-background cells within the grid boundaries are modified.
5. **`(v, (i, j)) if j == jj else (2, (i, j))`**: Keeps the original cell value if `j == jj`, otherwise inserts '2'.
6. **`frozenset({...})`**: Creates a new object with the modified cells.
7. **`merge(...)`**: Merges all modified objects into a single object.
8. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the merged object onto the original grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
    return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1)) if  j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I) else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 2 but focuses on modifying the right side of each object cell:

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies objects excluding the background.
2. **`for v, (i, j) in obj for obj in ...`**: Iterates each cell of each object.
3. **`j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)`**: Checks if the right cell is within bounds and contains the background color.
4. **`(2, (i, j + 1)) ... else (v, (i, j))`**: Inserts '2' to the right if the condition is met, otherwise keeps the original cell.
5. **`frozenset({...})`**, `merge(...)`, `paint(I, ...)`: Same as in Version 2.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, v in enumerate(row):
            if v != mostcolor(I) and j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
                I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the process by iterating directly through grid cells:

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I):`**: Iterates through rows.
2. **`for j, v in enumerate(row):`**: Iterates through cells in each row.
3. **`if v != mostcolor(I) and j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == mostcolor(I):`**:  Checks if the current cell is not background, the right cell is within the row, and the right cell is background.
4. **`I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})`**: Fills the right cell with '2'.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
    return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1)) if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I) else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in  {(grid[k][l], (k, l)) for k, r in enumerate(crop(grid, ulcorner(obj), shape(obj))) for l, v in enumerate(r) if v != mostcolor(grid)}}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes cropping and further nested iterations:

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies objects excluding the background.
2. **`for obj in ...`**: Iterates each object.
3. **`crop(grid, ulcorner(obj), shape(obj))`**: Creates a subgrid containing only the current object.
4. **`{(grid[k][l], (k, l)) ... if v != mostcolor(grid)}`**: Iterates cells in the subgrid and keeps non-background cells.
5. **`for v, (i, j) in ...`**: Iterates cells from the previous step.
6. **`j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)`**: Checks the right cell.
7. **`(2, (i, j + 1)) ... else (v, (i, j))`**: Inserts '2' or keeps the original cell.
8. **`frozenset({...})`**, `merge(...)`, `paint(I, ...)`: Same as in previous versions.

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to solving the transformation problem. Each version leverages different DSL functions and logic flow, providing diverse solutions that highlight the flexibility of the provided DSL.
