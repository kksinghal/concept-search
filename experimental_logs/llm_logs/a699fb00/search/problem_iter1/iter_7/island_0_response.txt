## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected groups of the same digit) within the input grid. For each object, the transformation identifies the rightmost '1' in each row of the object. If this '1' is not on the right edge of the object (meaning there's a '0' immediately to its right in the original grid), it changes that '1' to a '2'.  

Let's illustrate with an example:

**Input:**

```
0 1 1 0
0 1 0 0
```

**Output:**

```
0 1 2 0
0 1 0 0 
```

Here, the top row of the object has its rightmost '1' changed to a '2' because there is a '0' to its right in the input.  The bottom row's rightmost '1' remains unchanged because it's already on the edge of the object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      TWO if (cell == ONE and j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO and (i, j) in toindices(objects(I, T, F, F)))
      else cell
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    ) for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The code iterates through each cell (value `cell` at index `(i, j)`) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify rightmost '1's:** It checks if the current cell is `ONE` and not on the right edge of the grid (`j < len(row) - 1`). 
3. **Check for '0' to the right:** If the conditions in step 2 are met, it further checks if the cell to the right (`I[i][j + 1]`) is `ZERO`. 
4. **Ensure it's part of an object:** It also checks if the current cell `(i, j)` is part of an object using `(i, j) in toindices(objects(I, T, F, F))`.
5. **Change to '2':** If all the conditions above are true, the cell is changed to `TWO`. Otherwise, the original cell value is retained.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      TWO if any((cell == ONE and (i, j + 1) in delta(obj)) for obj in objs if (i, j) in toindices(obj))
      else cell
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects:**  It first identifies all objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Iterate and check for each object:** For each cell, it iterates through the objects and checks if:
    - The cell belongs to the current object (`(i, j) in toindices(obj)`).
    - The cell is '1' and the position to its right is part of the object's delta (meaning it's a '0' bordering the object).
3. **Change to '2':** If both conditions are met for any object, the cell is changed to '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted = tuple(tuple(ZERO) + row[:-1] for row in I)
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if (cell == ONE and shifted[i][j] == ZERO and (i, j) in toindices(objects(I, T, F, F))) 
            else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        ) for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a shifted grid:** Creates a new grid (`shifted`) where each row is shifted one position to the right, padding the left with `ZERO`.
2. **Iterate and compare:**  Iterates through the original grid and compares each cell with the corresponding cell in the shifted grid.
3. **Change to '2':**  If a cell is '1' and the corresponding cell in the shifted grid is '0', and it's part of an object, it's changed to '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO 
            if (j < len(row) - 1 and cell == ONE and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO and any(I[k][j] == ONE for k in range(i + 1, len(I))))
            else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        ) for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check right neighbor and below:** For each '1', it checks if the right neighbor is '0' and if there is another '1' below it in the same column. 
3. **Change to '2':** If all conditions are met, the '1' is changed to '2'. This version cleverly ensures that the '1' is part of a larger object by checking for another '1' below it.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if any((cell == ONE and (i, j) == urcorner(obj)) for obj in objs if (i, j) in toindices(obj))
            else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        ) for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and check for each object:** For each cell, it checks if:
    - The cell belongs to the current object.
    - The cell is '1' and the cell is the upper-right corner of the object (`(i, j) == urcorner(obj)`).
3. **Change to '2':** If both conditions are met for any object, the cell is changed to '2'. This version directly identifies the rightmost '1's by checking for upper-right corners within objects.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same outcome, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. They highlight different ways to manipulate grids, identify objects, and apply conditional transformations.
