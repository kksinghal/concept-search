## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending all horizontal lines of '1's to the right by one cell and filling that cell with the digit '2'.  Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The top-right '1' is extended to the right, adding a '2' to its right.
* The bottom '1 1' line is extended similarly, adding a '2' to the right of each '1'.

**Input_1:**

* All horizontal lines of '1's (three in total) are extended to the right by one cell, each adding a '2'. 

**Input_2:**

*  Similar to the previous examples, every horizontal line of '1's is extended to the right, adding a '2' to each.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(obj):
    return {(TWO, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < width(I) and (TWO, (i, j + 1)) not in obj and v == ONE}
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_right, objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_right(obj)`:** This function takes an object (a set of connected '1's) and returns a new set of cells. For each cell in the input object, it checks if it can be extended to the right (within the grid boundaries and not already a '2'). If it can, a new cell with value '2' is added to the right.
2. **`objects(...)`:**  This function identifies all connected objects of '1's in the input grid.
3. **`apply(extend_right, ...)`:** The `extend_right` function is applied to each identified object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** The results from `extend_right` (sets of new cells) are merged into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Finally, the '2's from the merged set are painted onto the original input grid `I`, producing the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, recolor(TWO, mfilter(lambda idx: index(I, idx) == ONE and idx[1] + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (idx[0], idx[1] + 1)) == ZERO, asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:**  Gets all cell indices of the input grid.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters the indices, keeping those that:
    - Have a '1' at their position in the grid.
    - Have a column index less than the grid width - 1 (ensuring there's space to the right).
    - Have a '0' to their immediate right in the grid.
3. **`recolor(TWO, ...)`:**  Recolors the filtered indices to have the value '2'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the recolored indices onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_extension(obj):
    return {(TWO, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < width(I) and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(obj)}
  return paint(I, merge(apply(right_extension, partition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`partition(I)`:** Divides the input grid into objects based on cell values (each object will be a set of connected cells with the same value).
2. **`right_extension(obj)`:** Similar to `extend_right` in version 1, but operates on any object, not just '1's. It finds cells at the right edge of the object and creates new cells with value '2' to their right.
3. **`apply(right_extension, ...)`:**  Applies `right_extension` to all objects.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the new cells from all objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged new cells onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_neighbor(i, j):
    return (i, j + 1) if j + 1 < width(I) else None
  return paint(I, {(TWO, right_neighbor(i, j)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == ONE and right_neighbor(i, j) and index(I, right_neighbor(i, j)) == ZERO})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_neighbor(i, j)`:** This function determines the index of the right neighbor for a cell at (i, j), returning `None` if the cell is on the right edge.
2. The code then uses a set comprehension to iterate through all cells of the grid and creates new cells with value '2' to the right of cells containing '1', but only if the right neighbor exists and has a value of '0'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shifted_right(obj):
    return shift(obj, (0, 1))
  return paint(I, recolor(TWO, difference(toindices(merge(apply(shifted_right, objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)))), toindices(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(...)`:** Finds all connected objects of '1's.
2. **`shifted_right(obj)`:** Shifts an object one cell to the right.
3. **`apply(shifted_right, ...)`:** Applies the shift to all objects.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the shifted objects.
5. **`toindices(...)`:**  Converts the merged shifted objects and the original objects to indices.
6. **`difference(...)`:**  Finds the indices present in the shifted objects but not in the original objects (these are the cells to be filled with '2').
7. **`recolor(TWO, ...)`:** Recolors the difference indices to have the value '2'.
8. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the recolored indices onto the input grid.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each version leverages various DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
