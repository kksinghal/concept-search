## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a "2" to the right of every "1" in the input grid. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**

- Input:  `1 0 1 0 0` 
            `0 0 0 0 0` 
            `0 0 0 0 0` 
            `0 1 0 1 0` 
            `0 0 0 0 0`
- Output: `1 2 1 0 0` 
            `0 0 0 0 0` 
            `0 0 0 0 0` 
            `0 1 2 1 0` 
            `0 0 0 0 0`

The transformation adds a "2" to the right of each "1".

**Pair 1 & 2:**

The same logic applies to input grids 1 and 2 â€“ each "1" gets a "2" added immediately to its right.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset({(2 if j == rightmost(toindices(obj)) else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if v==1} | {(2, (i, j+1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if v==1 and j < len(I[0])-1}), objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the input grid (`I`).
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ...)`:**  Applies a lambda function to each object.
3. **`frozenset({(2 if j == rightmost(toindices(obj)) else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if v==1} | {(2, (i, j+1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if v==1 and j < len(I[0])-1})`:** This part of the lambda function does the following:
    - It iterates through all cells `(v, (i, j))` of the object.
    - If the cell value `v` is 1, it keeps the cell as is and adds a new cell with value 2 to the right of it `(2, (i, j+1))`, but only if the current cell is not at the right edge of the grid (`j < len(I[0])-1`).
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the transformed objects back into a single object set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the transformed objects onto the original input grid, resulting in the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_ones = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in ones if j < len(I[0]) - 1)
  twos = recolor(2, shifted_ones)
  return paint(I, twos) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Finds the indices of all cells with the value "1".
2. **`shifted_ones = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in ones if j < len(I[0]) - 1)`:**  Calculates the indices one position to the right of each "1", ensuring it stays within the grid boundaries.
3. **`twos = recolor(2, shifted_ones)`:**  Creates an object representing the "2"s to be placed at the calculated positions.
4. **`return paint(I, twos)`:**  Draws the "2"s onto the original grid, creating the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(1 if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 else 2 if (i, j - 1) in ofcolor(I, 1) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation:

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`:**  Iterates through each row (`row`) and its index (`i`) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **`for j, v in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates through each value (`v`) and its index (`j`) in the current row.
3. **`1 if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 else 2 if (i, j - 1) in ofcolor(I, 1) else v`:**  This conditional statement determines the new value for each cell:
    - If the current cell is "1" and not on the right edge, it remains "1".
    - If the cell to the left was a "1", it becomes "2".
    - Otherwise, the cell retains its original value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if v != 1 else (1, 2)[j < len(row) - 1] for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in (tuple(1 if v == 1 else 0 for v in row) for row in I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version employs a combination of generators and list comprehensions:

1. **`(tuple(1 if v == 1 else 0 for v in row) for row in I)`:**  Creates a generator that converts the input grid into a grid of only "1"s and "0"s, preserving the "1"s' positions.
2.  **`for row in ...`:**  Iterates through each row of this intermediate grid.
3. **`tuple(v if v != 1 else (1, 2)[j < len(row) - 1] for j, v in enumerate(row))`:**  For each cell in the row:
    - If the value isn't "1", it remains unchanged.
    - If it is "1", it uses array slicing with a boolean condition to decide between "1" (if at the right edge) or "2" (otherwise).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(tuple(2 if (i, j-1) in ofcolor(I, 1) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic by focusing on placing the "2"s:

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`:** Iterates through each row and its index.
2. **`for j, v in enumerate(row)`:**  Iterates through each value and its index in the row.
3. **`2 if (i, j-1) in ofcolor(I, 1) else v`:** If the cell to the left was a "1", the current cell becomes a "2"; otherwise, it retains its original value.
