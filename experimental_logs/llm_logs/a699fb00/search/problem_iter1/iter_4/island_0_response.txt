## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background color) consisting only of the digit '1'. Then, for each object, it changes the color of the cell immediately to the right of each '1' to '2', but only if that cell was initially '0'.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** There are two objects formed by '1's. In the top object, the rightmost '1' has a '0' to its right, so it's changed to '2'.  The same logic applies to the bottom object.
* **Input_1 & Input_2:** The same rule is applied consistently to all objects in the larger grids.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      TWO if j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO else cell
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The code iterates through each row (`i`) and cell (`j`) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Check right neighbor:** For each cell, it checks if:
    * It's not the last cell in the row (`j < len(row) - 1`).
    * The current cell contains '1' (`I[i][j] == ONE`).
    * The cell to the right contains '0' (`I[i][j + 1] == ZERO`).
3. **Change to '2':** If all conditions are met, the cell is changed to '2' (`TWO`). Otherwise, it remains unchanged (`cell`).


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      TWO if j < len(row) - 1 and (i, j) in toindices(objects(I, T, F, F)) and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO else cell
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** This version first uses `objects(I, T, F, F)` to find all objects (connected regions of the same digit). 
2. **Iterate and check:** It then iterates through cells like Version 1 but adds a check:
    * If the current cell's index `(i, j)` is part of any object (`in toindices(objects(I, T, F, F))`).
3. **Change to '2':**  The rest of the logic is identical to Version 1, changing the cell to '2' only if it's inside an object, contains '1', and has a '0' to its right.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if (i, j) in toindices(shifted) and I[i][j] == ZERO and (i, j - 1) in toindices(asobject(I)) and I[i][j - 1] == ONE else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create shifted grid:**  This version first creates a new grid `shifted` by shifting the entire input grid `I` one cell to the right using `shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))`.
2. **Iterate and compare:** It iterates through the original grid and checks for each cell:
    * If the cell's index `(i, j)` exists in the `shifted` grid (meaning there was a cell to its left originally).
    * If the current cell is '0'.
    * If the cell to its left `(i, j - 1)` was originally a '1'.
3. **Change to '2':** If all conditions are met, it changes the cell to '2'. 


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if any((i, k) in toindices(objects(I, T, F, F)) and I[i][k] == ONE and k == j + 1 for k in range(len(row))) else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and search:** This version iterates through cells and uses `any(...)` to search for a specific condition within each row.
2. **Check for '1' on the right:** For each cell, it checks if there's any cell `(i, k)` to its right (by iterating through `k` in the row) that:
    * Belongs to an object.
    * Contains the value '1'.
3. **Change to '2':** If such a '1' is found to the right within the same row, and the current cell is '0', it's changed to '2'. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == ONE and I[i][j] == ZERO and any((i, k) in toindices(objects(I, T, F, F)) for k in range(j)) else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and look left and right:**  This version iterates through cells and checks for conditions both to the left and right.
2. **Check left neighbor:** For each cell, it checks if:
    * It's not the first cell in the row (`j > 0`).
    * The cell to its left contains '1' (`I[i][j - 1] == ONE`).
    * The current cell contains '0' (`I[i][j] == ZERO`).
3. **Check for object to the left:** It then uses `any(...)` to see if there's any cell belonging to an object (`in toindices(objects(I, T, F, F))`) in the same row but to the left of the current cell (`k` in `range(j)`). 
4. **Change to '2':** If all these conditions are met, the cell is changed to '2'. This ensures that the transformation only occurs if the '0' is connected to a '1' that's part of an object.
