## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected groups of the same digit) within the input grid and then shifting specific elements of these objects to the right by one position. However, the shift only occurs if the element's value is '1' and it's not on the rightmost edge of the object.  

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** 
* The '1' at (0,1) in the top-left object shifts right to (0,2). 
* The '1' at (3,3) in the bottom-left object shifts right to (3,4).

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
* In each of the four objects, the rightmost '1' remains in place.
* All other '1's shift one position to the right.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
* Similar to the previous examples, rightmost '1's in each object remain unchanged. 
* All other '1's are shifted one position to the right.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(v, (i, j + 1)) if v == 1 and j + 1 < width(obj) else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in ...`**: Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`{(v, (i, j + 1)) if ... else (v, (i, j)) ...`**:  For each element `(v, (i, j))` in the object:
    - If the value `v` is '1' and it's not on the rightmost edge (`j + 1 < width(obj)`), it's shifted right by one position (`(i, j + 1)`). 
    - Otherwise, the element remains unchanged (`(v, (i, j))`).
4. **`frozenset({...})`**: Creates a new object with the shifted elements.
5. **`merge({...})`**:  Combines all the transformed objects back into a single set.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the transformed objects onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(2 if v == 1 and j < rightmost(obj) else v, (i, j + 1 if v == 1 and j < rightmost(obj) else j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**:  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in ...`**:  Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`{(2 if ... else v, (i, j + 1 if ... else j)) ...`**: For each element `(v, (i, j))` in the object:
    - If the value `v` is '1' and its column index `j` is less than the rightmost column index of the object (`j < rightmost(obj)`), the value is changed to '2' and the column index is incremented (`(2, (i, j + 1))`).
    - Otherwise, the element remains unchanged (`(v, (i, j))`).
4. **`frozenset({...})`**: Creates a new object with the shifted elements.
5. **`merge({...})`**: Combines all the transformed objects back into a single set.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the transformed objects onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset({(2 if v == 1 and any((a, b) for a, b in obj if a == i and b > j) else v, (i, j + 1 if v == 1 and any((a, b) for a, b in obj if a == i and b > j) else j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}), objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., objects(I, T, F, F))`**: Applies a lambda function to each object.
3. **`lambda obj: frozenset({...})`**: The lambda function takes an object as input and returns a transformed object as a frozenset.
4. **`{(2 if ... else v, (i, j + 1 if ... else j)) ...`**: For each element `(v, (i, j))` in the object:
    - If the value `v` is '1' and there exists another element in the same object with the same row index `i` and a larger column index `j` (`any((a, b) for a, b in obj if a == i and b > j)`), it shifts the current element to the right and changes its value to '2'.
    - Otherwise, the element remains unchanged.
5. **`merge(...)`**:  Combines all the transformed objects back into a single set.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the transformed objects onto the original input grid `I`. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(v, (i, j + 1)) if v == 1 and (i, j) !=  urcorner(obj) else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in ...`**: Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`{(v, (i, j + 1)) if ... else (v, (i, j)) ...`**: For each element `(v, (i, j))` in the object:
    - If the value `v` is '1' and the element's index `(i, j)` is not the upper-right corner of the object (`(i, j) != urcorner(obj)`), it's shifted right by one position.
    - Otherwise, the element remains in its original position.
4. **`frozenset({...})`**: Creates a new object with the shifted elements.
5. **`merge({...})`**: Combines all the transformed objects back into a single set.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the transformed objects onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(v, astuple(i, j + 1)) if v == 1 and j < rightmost(toindices(obj)) else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in ...`**: Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`{(v, astuple(i, j + 1)) if ... else (v, (i, j)) ...`**: For each element `(v, (i, j))` in the object:
    - If the value `v` is '1' and the column index `j` is less than the rightmost column index of the object's indices (`j < rightmost(toindices(obj))`), it's shifted right by one position and the new index is constructed using `astuple`.
    - Otherwise, the element remains unchanged.
4. **`frozenset({...})`**:  Creates a new object with the shifted elements.
5. **`merge({...})`**: Combines all the transformed objects back into a single set.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the transformed objects onto the original input grid `I`.

These five program versions provide different ways to achieve the desired transformation. They demonstrate various DSL function combinations and logic flow while ensuring the output grid is exactly as required.
