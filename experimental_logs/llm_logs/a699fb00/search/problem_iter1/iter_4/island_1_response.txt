## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' and adding the digit '2' to the right of each '1' within the object. The background (digit '0') and other objects remain unchanged.

**Example:**

```
Input:
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Output:
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(
    I,
    fill(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      2,
      shift(ofcolor(I, 1), RIGHT)
    ),
    fallback=I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **`shift(..., RIGHT)`:** Shifts the identified indices one position to the right.
3. **`canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Creates a canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with '0'.
4. **`fill(..., 2, ...)`:** Fills the canvas with the digit '2' at the shifted indices.
5. **`cellwise(I, ..., fallback=I)`:** Merges the original input grid with the filled canvas, prioritizing the original values where they overlap.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    I, 
    frozenset(
      (2, (i, j + 1)) 
      for v, (i, j) in asobject(I) 
      if v == 1 and j < width(I) - 1
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the input grid into an object representation.
2. **`(2, (i, j + 1)) ... for v, (i, j) in ... if v == 1 and j < width(I) - 1`:** Iterates through the object and creates a new object with '2' at indices shifted one position to the right, only for cells containing '1' and not at the rightmost edge.
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the new object onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, RIGHT) for obj in objs)
  return paint(
    paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      recolor(1, merge(objs))
    ),
    recolor(2, merge(shifted_objs))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(...)`:**  Extracts objects formed by '1's, ignoring the background.
2. **`shifted_objs = ...`:** Creates a new set of objects shifted one position to the right.
3. **`recolor(1, merge(objs))`:**  Creates an object with all original objects recolored to '1'.
4. **`paint(canvas(...), ...)`:** Paints the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.
5. **`recolor(2, merge(shifted_objs))`:** Creates an object with all shifted objects recolored to '2'.
6. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the shifted and recolored objects onto the canvas containing the original objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j < width(I) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0 else row[j] 
      for j in range(len(row))
    ) 
    for row in I
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterates** through each row and cell of the input grid.
2. **Checks** if the current cell is '1', not at the rightmost edge, and the cell to its right is '0'.
3. **Replaces** the current cell with '2' if the conditions are met, otherwise keeps the original value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = mfilter(
      asindices(I), 
      lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1 and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0
  )
  return paint(
      I, 
      recolor(2, shifted_indices)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Gets all indices of the input grid.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters the indices to select only those where the current cell is '1' and the cell to its right is '0'.
3. **`recolor(2, shifted_indices)`:** Creates an object with '2' at the filtered indices.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the new object onto the original input grid.
