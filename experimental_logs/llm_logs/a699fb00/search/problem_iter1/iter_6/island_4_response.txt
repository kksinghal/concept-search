## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of a specific color (likely '1') and extending them to the right by one cell, coloring the new cell with a different color (likely '2'). 

**Let's analyze each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The single-cell objects are extended to the right. Notice how the top-right '1' doesn't extend because there's no space within the grid.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to Input_0, all single-cell objects are extended.  The transformation affects multiple disconnected objects independently.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** This example confirms the pattern, with the objects in various positions all being extended rightwards.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset({(2 if j < rightmost(obj) else v, (i, j + 1 if j < rightmost(obj) else j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}), objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all connected objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ... , objects(I, T, F, F))`:**  Applies a transformation function to each extracted object.
3. **`lambda obj: frozenset({(2 if j < rightmost(obj) else v, (i, j + 1 if j < rightmost(obj) else j)) for v, (i, j) in obj})`:**  This lambda function iterates through each cell (v, (i, j)) of an object:
    * **`j < rightmost(obj)`:** Checks if the cell is not the rightmost cell of the object.
    * If it's not the rightmost cell, it transforms the cell's value to '2' and increments its column index 'j'.
    * If it's the rightmost cell, it keeps the original value and index.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the transformed objects back into a single object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged transformed object onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: obj | frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < len(I[0])}), objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2.  **`apply(lambda obj: ..., objects(I, T, F, F))`:** Applies a function to each object.
3.  **`lambda obj: obj | frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1)) ...})`:** For each object:
    *   **`obj | ...`:**  Keeps the original object.
    *   **`frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1)) ...})`:**  Adds a new cell with value '2' to the right of each cell in the object, if the new cell is within the grid boundaries.
4.  **`merge(...)`:** Combines all transformed objects.
5.  **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Draws the transformed objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(obj):
    return frozenset((v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < len(I[0]))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, merge(apply(extend_right, objects(I, T, F, F))))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_right(obj)`:** This helper function takes an object and generates a new set of cells shifted one position to the right. It only includes cells that fall within the grid boundaries.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all connected objects from the input grid.
3. **`apply(extend_right, ...)`:** Applies the `extend_right` function to each extracted object.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the shifted cells (which are now considered a single object) into a single object.
5. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Changes the color of the merged object to '2'.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Draws the recolored, shifted object onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_cell_right(v, i, j):
    return (2, (i, j + 1)) if j + 1 < len(I[0]) else (v, (i, j))
  return paint(I, frozenset(shift_cell_right(v, i, j) for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) for v, (i, j) in obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift_cell_right(v, i, j)`:** This function takes a cell's value and coordinates. It returns a new cell with value '2' and incremented column index if it's within the grid boundaries. Otherwise, it returns the original cell.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts objects from the grid.
3. **`... for obj in objects(...) for v, (i, j) in obj`:**  Iterates through each cell of each object.
4. **`shift_cell_right(v, i, j)`:** Applies the shifting function to each cell.
5. **`frozenset(...)`:** Creates a new object from the transformed cells.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the transformed object onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    return obj | frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < rightmost(obj)})
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_object(obj)`:** This helper function takes an object and adds a new cell to the right of each cell, as long as it's not already the rightmost cell in the object.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts connected objects from the input.
3. **`apply(extend_object, ...)`:** Applies `extend_object` to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the extended objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Draws the final result on the input grid. 

These are just five possible solutions, and many other valid solutions might exist within the provided DSL. Each solution demonstrates a slightly different approach to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
