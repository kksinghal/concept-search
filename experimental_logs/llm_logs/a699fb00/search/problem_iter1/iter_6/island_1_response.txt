## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing the digit '0' to the right of each '1' with a '2'.  Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input 0:**

* The '0's to the right of the '1's at positions (0,0), (0,2), and (3,1) are replaced with '2's.

**Input 1:**

* Similarly,  '0's to the right of the '1's at (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (1,7), (4,2), (6,6), (6,8), and (8,3) are replaced.

**Input 2:**

* The pattern continues, with replacements occurring at (2,1), (2,3), (5,3), (5,5), (5,7), (7,5), (9,1), and (9,3).

## Code Generation: 

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(
    I,
    fill(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      2,
      mpapply(
        lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1]+1),
        sfilter(
          asindices(I), 
          lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1
        )
      )
    ),
    fallback=I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`sfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1)`:** This identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
2. **`mpapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1]+1), ...)`:**  This shifts the identified indices one position to the right.
3. **`fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 2, ...)`:**  A canvas of '0's with the same shape as the input grid is created. Then, it fills '2' at the shifted indices.
4. **`cellwise(I, ..., fallback=I)`:**  This merges the original input grid with the canvas containing '2's. It uses the 'fallback=I' argument to retain the original values from the input grid where the canvas has '0's.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_right_if_one(loc):
    return (loc[0], loc[1]+1) if index(I, loc) == 1 else None

  return fill(
    I,
    2,
    mfilter(
      asindices(I),
      shift_right_if_one
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift_right_if_one(loc)`:** This helper function checks if a given location contains '1'. If it does, it returns the index to the right; otherwise, it returns `None`.
2. **`mfilter(asindices(I), shift_right_if_one)`:**  This applies the helper function to all indices of the input grid and merges the valid shifted indices (those to the right of '1's).
3. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:**  This fills the input grid with '2's at the identified shifted indices.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j < len(row) - 1 and val == 1 and row[j+1] == 0 else val 
      for j, val in enumerate(row)
    ) 
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested loops to iterate through each cell and directly applies the transformation logic:

1. **`for row in I`:** Iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **`for j, val in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates through each value (`val`) and its index (`j`) in the current row.
3. **`2 if j < len(row) - 1 and val == 1 and row[j+1] == 0 else val`**:  This checks if the current value is '1' and the next value in the row is '0'. If both conditions are true, it replaces the current value with '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row):
    new_row = list(row)
    for j in range(len(row)-1):
      if row[j] == 1 and row[j+1] == 0:
        new_row[j+1] = 2
    return tuple(new_row)

  return tuple(process_row(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a helper function (`process_row`) to encapsulate the row-level transformation:

1. **`process_row(row)`:** This function takes a row as input, creates a modifiable copy (`new_row`), and iterates through its elements. 
2. **`if row[j] == 1 and row[j+1] == 0: new_row[j+1] = 2`:** If the current element is '1' and the next is '0', it replaces the next element in `new_row` with '2'.
3. The modified `new_row` is returned as a tuple.
4. Finally, the main function applies `process_row` to each row of the input grid using a list comprehension. 

### Program Version 5: 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    I,
    recolor(
      2, 
      mpapply(
        lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), 
        ofcolor(I, 1)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:** This identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
2. **`mpapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ...)`:**  This shifts the identified indices one position to the right.
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Creates a new object by recoloring the shifted indices with '2'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  This paints the new object (containing only '2's at the shifted positions) onto the original input grid, effectively replacing the '0's. 

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
