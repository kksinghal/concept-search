## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid and extending them to the right by one cell. The new cell takes the value '2'.

**Input 0:**
* Two objects are identified: {(1, (0, 0)), (1, (0, 2))} and {(1, (3, 1)), (1, (3, 3))}. 
* Both objects are extended to the right by one cell with the value '2'.

**Input 1:**
* Five objects are identified. 
* Each object is extended to the right by one cell with the value '2'.

**Input 2:**
* Six objects are identified.
* Each object is extended to the right by one cell with the value '2'.

## Program to be Generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(obj):
    return recolor(TWO, shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_right, objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:**  Identifies all objects (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **`apply(extend_right, ...)`:**  Applies the `extend_right` function to each identified object.
3. **`extend_right(obj)`:**
    * **`toindices(obj)`:** Extracts the indices of cells belonging to the object.
    * **`shift(..., RIGHT)`:** Shifts the indices one position to the right.
    * **`recolor(TWO, ...)`:**  Assigns the value '2' to the shifted indices.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all the extended objects into a single set of cells.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the extended cells onto the original input grid `I`, creating the output grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_edge(obj):
    return {(TWO, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < width(I) and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(obj)}
  return paint(I, merge(apply(right_edge, objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(...)`:**  Identifies objects in the input grid.
2. **`apply(right_edge, ...)`:** Applies `right_edge` to each object.
3. **`right_edge(obj)`:** 
    * Iterates through each cell in the object.
    * If a cell has a right neighbor within the grid bounds and the neighbor is not part of the object, it adds a new cell with value '2' to the right.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the new cells from all objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the new cells onto the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right_indices(indices):
    return {(i, j + 1) for (i, j) in indices if j + 1 < width(I)}
  return paint(I, recolor(TWO, merge(apply(extend_right_indices, apply(toindices, objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(...)`:**  Identifies objects in the input.
2. **`apply(toindices, ...)`:**  Extracts cell indices for each object.
3. **`apply(extend_right_indices, ...)`:**  Applies `extend_right_indices` to each object's indices.
4. **`extend_right_indices(indices)`:** Adds indices of right neighbors to each cell's index if they are within the grid bounds.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all new indices.
6. **`recolor(TWO, ...)`:**  Sets the value of cells at the new indices to '2'.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the modified cells onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      if j + 1 < width(I):
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(...)`:**  Identifies objects in the input grid.
2.  Iterates through each object and its cell indices.
3.  For each cell, if a right neighbor exists within the grid, it paints that neighbor with '2' directly on the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(TWO, difference(shift(asindices(I), RIGHT), asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`asindices(I)`:**  Gets indices of all cells in the input grid.
2. **`shift(..., RIGHT)`:**  Shifts all indices one position to the right.
3. **`difference(..., asindices(I))`:**  Finds the difference between the shifted indices and original indices, resulting in indices that represent the right edge of the grid.
4. **`recolor(TWO, ...)`:**  Sets the value of cells at the identified edge indices to '2'.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the modified cells onto the input grid.
