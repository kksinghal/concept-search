## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves changing the value of specific cells to "2". The pattern is:

* **For every occurrence of '1'**:  Change the cell immediately to the right of '1' to '2'.
* **Edge Cases**: If '1' is on the rightmost edge of the grid, no change is made. 

This holds true for all three input-output pairs.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      TWO if j < len(row)-1 and row[j] == ONE and row[j+1] == ZERO else cell
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  `for i, row in enumerate(I)` iterates over each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through cells:** `for j, cell in enumerate(row)` iterates over each cell within the current row.
3. **Check for pattern:** `j < len(row)-1 and row[j] == ONE and row[j+1] == ZERO` checks if the current cell is '1', not on the rightmost edge, and the cell to its right is '0'.
4. **Apply transformation:** If the pattern is found, the current cell's value is changed to '2' (`TWO`); otherwise, it remains unchanged (`cell`).
5. **Return transformed grid:** The modified grid is returned as a tuple of tuples.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(TWO, (i, j + 1))}) for v, (i, j) in merge(objs) if j < len(I[0]) - 1}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' cells:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects from the grid, where each object represents a connected component of '1's. 
2. **Iterate through objects and cells:** `for v, (i, j) in merge(objs)` iterates over each cell belonging to the objects.
3. **Check for edge:** `if j < len(I[0]) - 1` ensures the current cell is not on the rightmost edge.
4. **Create new object:** If not on the edge, create a new object containing a single cell with value '2' located to the right of the current cell: `(TWO, (i, j + 1))`.
5. **Merge and paint:** Merge all the new objects (`merge(...)`) and paint them onto the original grid using `paint(I, ...)`. This effectively replaces the target cells with '2'.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      TWO if any(I[i][k] == ONE and k == j - 1 for k in range(len(row))) else cell
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to version 1, but instead of checking the cell to the right, it checks the cell to the left (`k == j - 1`). This achieves the same transformation due to the symmetrical nature of the pattern.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(j < len(row)-1 and row[j] == ONE and row[j+1] == ZERO, TWO, cell)
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version is functionally identical to version 1 but uses the `branch` function for a more explicit conditional assignment. It checks the same pattern and applies the transformation accordingly.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  shifted_grid = tuple(tuple(ZERO) + row[:-1] for row in I)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      TWO if cell == ONE and shifted_grid[i][j] == ZERO else cell
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create shifted grid:** `shifted_grid = tuple(tuple(ZERO) + row[:-1] for row in I)` creates a new grid where each row is shifted one position to the right, with the last element removed and a '0' added at the beginning.
2. **Iterate and compare:** The code iterates through the original grid `I` and the `shifted_grid` simultaneously. 
3. **Apply transformation:** If a cell in the original grid is '1' and the corresponding cell in the `shifted_grid` is '0', it means the original cell had a '0' to its right, so it is changed to '2'.

These five programs showcase different approaches to achieve the same goal, utilizing various DSL functions and logic.
