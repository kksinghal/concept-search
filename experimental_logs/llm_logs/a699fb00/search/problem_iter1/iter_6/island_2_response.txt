## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and extending them one cell to the right, but only if the target cell is empty (contains a 0).

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Object Identification:** The transformation starts by identifying distinct objects within the input grid. An object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same digit value, excluding the background color (which is assumed to be the most frequent color).
2. **Rightward Extension:**  For each identified object, the program examines every cell belonging to that object. If a cell has an empty cell (containing a 0) directly to its right, the transformation extends the object into that empty cell by replicating the object's digit value. 

**Example:**

Let's consider Input_0:

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

The program identifies three objects: two objects with the digit '1' and one object with the digit '0'. Focusing on the top-left '1' object, it finds an empty cell to its right. Thus, it extends the object by placing a '1' in that cell, resulting in:

```
1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

The same logic applies to other objects, leading to the final Output_0:

```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(frozenset(
                 {(color(obj), (i, j + 1)) 
                  for _, (i, j) in obj 
                  if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0} 
                 for obj in objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

- `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`, considering connected cells with the same value (T), ignoring diagonals (F), and excluding the background (T).
- The outer loop iterates through each identified `obj`.
- The inner loop iterates through each cell `(i, j)` within the current `obj`.
- `if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0`: Checks if the cell to the right is within the grid bounds and is empty.
- If true, it adds a new cell with the object's color (`color(obj)`) at the position `(i, j + 1)` to a set.
- `frozenset(...)`: Creates a frozenset of the new cells, making it hashable for the `merge` function.
- `merge(...)`: Combines the sets of new cells from all objects into a single frozenset.
- `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the new cells onto the original grid `I`, effectively extending the objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  return paint(I, 
               mapply(lambda obj:
                     frozenset((color(obj), (i, j + 1)) 
                       for _, (i, j) in obj 
                       if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0), 
                      objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to Version 1 but uses `mapply` instead of nested loops and `merge`.
- `mapply` applies the lambda function to each object in `objects(I, T, F, T)` and merges the results into a single frozenset.
- The lambda function creates a frozenset of new cells for each object, similar to the inner loop in Version 1.
- This version achieves the same outcome with a more concise syntax.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  return paint(I, 
               frozenset((color(obj), add((i, j), (0, 1))) 
                 for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) 
                 for _, (i, j) in obj 
                 if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, add((i, j), (0, 1))) == 0))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses a generator expression within `frozenset` to achieve the same result as the previous versions.
- It iterates through each object and its cells using nested loops, similar to Version 1.
- It uses the `add` function to calculate the coordinates of the cell to the right.
- The conditional statement checks if the target cell is within bounds and empty.
- If true, a tuple containing the object's color and the target cell's coordinates is added to the frozenset.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    return frozenset((color(obj), (i, j + 1)) 
                      for _, (i, j) in obj 
                      if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines a separate function `extend_object` to encapsulate the logic of extending a single object.
- The `extend_object` function takes an object as input and returns a frozenset of new cells, similar to the previous versions.
- `apply(extend_object, objects(I, T, F, T))`: Applies the `extend_object` function to each object identified in the input grid.
- `merge(...)`: Combines the results from `apply` into a single frozenset.
- This version improves code readability by separating the object extension logic into a dedicated function.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  new_cells = set()
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != 0 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
        new_cells.add((index(I, (i, j)), (i, j + 1)))
  return paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version takes a different approach by iterating directly through the cells of the input grid `I`.
- The nested loops traverse each cell `(i, j)`.
- The conditional statement checks if the current cell is not empty (`index(I, (i, j)) != 0`) and its right neighbor is empty (`index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0`).
- If true, it adds a new cell with the current cell's color (`index(I, (i, j))`) at the position `(i, j + 1)` to the `new_cells` set.
- Finally, it paints the `new_cells` onto the original grid `I`.

These five program versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using the DSL. They showcase the flexibility of the DSL and provide multiple solutions to the problem, each with its own strengths in terms of conciseness, readability, or efficiency.
