## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1's) within the grid and adding '2's to the right of each '1' within these objects, but only if the cell to the right is empty (contains a '0').

**Input_0:**

* Two objects are identified: one in the top left corner and one in the bottom left corner.
* For both objects, a '2' is added to the right of each '1' where possible.

**Input_1:**

* Several small objects are identified. 
* The transformation is applied to each object, adding '2's to the right of '1's where possible.

**Input_2:**

* Similar to Input_1, the transformation adds '2's to the right of '1's within each object where the cell to the right is empty.


## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects, no diagonals, without background
  O = I 
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0: # Check if right cell exists and is empty
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)}) # Fill right cell with '2'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies objects (groups of connected '1's) within the input grid (`I`) without considering diagonal connections and excluding the background.
2.  **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object (`obj`).
3.  **Iterate Cells:** For each cell (`i`, `j`) within the current object, it checks if:
    *   The cell to its right exists (`j + 1 < len(I[0])`).
    *   The cell to the right is empty (`index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0`).
4.  **Fill Cell:** If both conditions are met, the code fills the cell to the right (`i`, `j + 1`) with the value '2' using `fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})`.
5.  **Return Output:** Finally, the modified grid (`O`) is returned as the output.

### Program Version 2

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 0: # Check if current cell is 1 and right cell exists and is 0
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)}) # Fill the right cell with 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate Rows and Cells:** This version iterates directly through rows and cells of the input grid (`I`).
2.  **Check Conditions:** For each cell (`i`, `j`) with value `val`, it verifies if:
    *   `val` is equal to 1.
    *   The cell to the right exists (`j + 1 < len(row)`).
    *   The cell to the right is empty (`row[j + 1] == 0`).
3.  **Fill Right Cell:** If all conditions are met, the cell to the right (`i`, `j + 1`) is filled with '2' using `fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})`.
4.  **Return Modified Grid:**  The function returns the modified grid `O`.

### Program Version 3

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs)  # Shift all objects to the right
  return paint(I, merge(sfilter(lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0, merge(shifted_objs)))) # Paint on empty cells
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies objects in the grid.
2.  **Shift Objects:**  `shifted_objs` is created by shifting each object in `objs` one cell to the right using `shift(obj, (0, 1))`.
3.  **Filter Empty Cells:**  `sfilter` is applied to the merged `shifted_objs` to keep only the cells where the corresponding cell in the original grid `I` is empty (value 0).
4.  **Paint Filtered Cells:**  The filtered cells are then painted onto the original grid `I` with the value 2 using `paint`.

### Program Version 4

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return cellwise(I, shift(replace(I, 0, 9), (0, 1)), I) # Shift grid right after replacing 0 with temporary value
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Replace and Shift:** Replaces all occurrences of '0' in the grid with a temporary value ('9' in this case).  The modified grid is then shifted one cell to the right using `shift(..., (0, 1))`.
2.  **Cellwise Comparison:**  `cellwise` compares the original grid with the shifted and replaced grid. If a cell in the original grid matches the corresponding cell in the shifted grid, the original cell value is kept. Otherwise, the original cell value is retained.
3.  **Return Modified Grid:** The function returns the modified grid.

### Program Version 5

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return paint(I, prapply(lambda i, j: (2, (i, j + 1)) if index(I, (i, j)) == 1 and j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0 else (0, (0, 0)), range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Apply on Product:** This version utilizes `prapply` to iterate over the Cartesian product of row and column indices of the input grid (`I`).
2.  **Conditional Filling:** For each cell (`i`, `j`) within the grid, the lambda function checks if the cell contains '1' and if its right neighbor exists and is '0'. If these conditions are met, a tuple `(2, (i, j + 1))` representing the value and location for filling is generated. Otherwise, a tuple `(0, (0, 0))`, which effectively does nothing, is returned.
3.  **Paint and Return:**  `paint` function then utilizes the generated tuples to paint the '2's onto the original grid at the specified locations. Finally, the modified grid is returned.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the DSL, illustrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided functions.
