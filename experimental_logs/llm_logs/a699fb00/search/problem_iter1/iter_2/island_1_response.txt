## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves placing the value '2' to the right of every occurrence of the value '1' in each row of the input grid, but only if there's an empty space (value '0') available.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* In the first row, '2' is placed to the right of both '1's.
* In the fourth row, '2' is placed to the right of the first '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* '2's are placed to the right of '1's in rows 1, 4, 6, and 8. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* '2's are placed to the right of '1's in rows 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's row-wise processing and Program_B's use of `fill`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if (j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and v == 0) else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through cells:** For each row, it iterates through each cell (value `v` at index `j`).
3. **Check for condition:** It checks if the current cell is not the first cell (`j > 0`), the previous cell is '1' (`row[j-1] == 1`), and the current cell is '0' (`v == 0`).
4. **Place '2' or retain value:** If the condition is true, it places a '2'. Otherwise, it retains the original value `v`.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by Program_B's use of `ofcolor` and `shift`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 2, intersection(shift(ofcolor(I, 1), RIGHT), ofcolor(I, 0)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Shift right:** `shift(..., RIGHT)` shifts these indices one position to the right.
3. **Find '0' indices:** `ofcolor(I, 0)` identifies the indices of all cells containing '0'.
4. **Intersect:** `intersection(..., ...)` finds the common indices from the shifted '1' indices and the '0' indices. These are the positions where '2' should be placed.
5. **Fill:** `fill(I, 2, ...)` fills the grid `I` with the value '2' at the identified indices.

**Version 3:** (Using list comprehension for a more Pythonic approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if (j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and v == 0) else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes nested list comprehensions to achieve the same logic as Version 1 in a more compact and Pythonic way.

**Version 4:** (Leveraging lambda functions for concise expression)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      apply(
          lambda row: tuple(
              (2 if j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1 and v == 0 else v)
              for j, v in enumerate(row)
          ),
          I,
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:** This version uses `apply` and a lambda function to iterate through the rows and apply the transformation logic to each row concisely.

**Version 5:** (Combining `cellwise` and conditional logic)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(
      I,
      tuple(
          tuple(
              2 if (j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1) else 0 
              for j in range(len(row))
          )
          for row in I
      ),
      fallback=I,
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a mask:** A new grid is created where '2' is placed one position to the right of each '1', and the rest of the cells are filled with '0'.
2. **Apply cellwise:** The `cellwise` function compares this mask with the original grid `I`. 
3. **Conditional replacement:**  If both grids have '2' at the same position, '2' is kept. Otherwise, the value from the original grid `I` (`fallback=I`) is used.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version employs a distinct combination of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
