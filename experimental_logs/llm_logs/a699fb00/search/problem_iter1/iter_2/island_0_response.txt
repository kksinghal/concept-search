## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit, excluding the background color 0) and inserting the digit '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The top-left and bottom-left corners contain '1's, each forming their own object. The transformation adds a '2' to the right of each '1'.
* **Input_1 and Input_2:**  The transformation is applied similarly, inserting a '2' to the right of each '1' within the various objects present.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      TWO if (i, j + 1) in toindices(objects(I, T, F, T)) and cell == ONE else cell 
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies objects in the grid `I` considering connected components of the same value (`T`), ignoring diagonal connections (`F`), and excluding the background (`T`).
2. **`toindices(...)`:** Extracts the indices of the cells belonging to each object.
3. **`(i, j + 1) in ...`:** Checks if the cell to the right of the current cell `(i, j)` belongs to an object.
4. **`... and cell == ONE`:**  Ensures that the current cell contains the digit '1'.
5. **`TWO if ... else cell`:** If both conditions are met, the cell is replaced with '2'; otherwise, the original cell value is retained.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               frozenset(
                 (TWO, (i, j + 1)) 
                 for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) 
                 for _, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and index(I, (i, j)) == ONE
               )
             )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies objects in the grid, similar to Version 1.
2. **`for _, (i, j) in obj ...`:** Iterates through each cell `(i, j)` within each object.
3. **`... if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and index(I, (i, j)) == ONE`:**  Checks if the cell is not on the rightmost edge and contains '1'.
4. **`(TWO, (i, j + 1))`:** Creates a tuple representing the '2' to be painted at the cell to the right.
5. **`frozenset(...)`:** Collects all the '2' placements into a single object.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the collected '2's onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_right(obj):
    return frozenset(((TWO, (i, j + 1)) if v == ONE and j < len(I[0]) - 1 else (v, (i, j))) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(shift_right, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift_right(obj)`:** Defines a helper function that takes an object and shifts all '1's one position to the right, replacing them with '2's, unless they are on the rightmost edge.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies objects in the grid.
3. **`apply(shift_right, ...)`:** Applies the `shift_right` function to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the transformed objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the combined objects onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      TWO if any(I[i][k] == ONE and k == j + 1 for k in range(len(row))) and cell != ZERO else cell
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version is similar to Program_B but adds an additional check to ensure that the current cell is not '0' before replacing it with '2'.
2. **`... and cell != ZERO`:** This condition ensures that '2' is not inserted into empty cells (represented by '0').

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill(obj):
    return frozenset(((TWO, (i, j + 1)) if v == ONE and j < len(I[0]) - 1 else (v, (i, j))) for v, (i, j) in obj if v != ZERO) 
  return paint(I, merge(apply(right_fill, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version is similar to Program Version 3, but it modifies the `right_fill` function to exclude background cells ('0') from the object before processing. 
2. **`... for v, (i, j) in obj if v != ZERO`:**  This condition filters out the background cells from the object.


These five programs showcase different ways to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
