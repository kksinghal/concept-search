## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and adding a '2' to the right of each '1' within the object, provided there's space within the grid.

**Input_0:**

- Two objects are present: one in the top left corner and one at the bottom left.
- A '2' is added to the right of the '1' in both objects.

**Input_1:**

- Several horizontally aligned objects of '1's are present.
- A '2' is added to the right of each '1' in all objects.

**Input_2:**

- Similar to Input_1, but with some objects vertically aligned.
- The same logic applies, with a '2' added to the right of each '1'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(v, (i, j)) if v != 1 else (2, (i, j + 1)) if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (v, (i, j + 1)) not in obj else (v, (i, j))  for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Identifies all objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`{(v, (i, j)) if v != 1 else (2, (i, j + 1)) if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (v, (i, j + 1)) not in obj else (v, (i, j))  for v, (i, j) in obj}`**:  Iterates through each cell of an object. If the cell is '1', it checks if it can place a '2' to its right (within grid bounds and not already part of the object). If possible, it places the '2'; otherwise, it keeps the '1' unchanged.
3. **`frozenset({...})`**: Creates a new object with the modified cells.
4. **`merge({...})`**: Combines all modified objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the merged objects onto the original grid `I`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1)) if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (1, (i, j + 1)) not in obj else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}), objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**:  Finds all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., objects(I, T, F, F))`**: Applies a lambda function to each object.
3. **`lambda obj: frozenset({...})`**: The lambda function takes an object and returns a new object with modified cells.
4. **`(2, (i, j + 1)) if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (1, (i, j + 1)) not in obj else (v, (i, j))`**:  For each cell, if it's a '1' and it can place a '2' to its right (within bounds and not in the object), it does so; otherwise, it retains the original cell value.
5. **`merge(...)`**: Merges all the modified objects.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the merged objects back onto the input grid `I`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(2, add((i, j), RIGHT)) if v == 1 and contained(add((i, j), RIGHT), asindices(I)) and not contained((1, add((i, j), RIGHT)), obj) else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**:  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`{(2, add((i, j), RIGHT)) ... else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}`**:  For each cell in an object, if the cell value is '1' and the conditions are met, it places a '2' to the right; otherwise, it keeps the original cell.
3. **`add((i, j), RIGHT)`**: Calculates the index of the cell to the right.
4. **`contained(..., asindices(I))`**: Checks if the right cell is within the grid bounds.
5. **`not contained((1, ...), obj)`**:  Checks if a '1' doesn't already exist at the target location within the object.
6. **`frozenset({...})`**:  Creates a new object with the modified cells.
7. **`merge({...})`**:  Combines all modified objects.
8. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Draws the combined objects onto the original grid `I`.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    return frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1)) if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (1, (i, j + 1)) not in obj else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj})
  return paint(I, merge(apply(modify_object, objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object(obj)`**: Defines a function to modify a single object.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
3. **`apply(modify_object, ...)`**:  Applies the `modify_object` function to each object.
4. **`frozenset({...})`**:  Within `modify_object`, this creates a new object with modified cells.
5. **`(2, (i, j + 1)) ... else (v, (i, j))`**:  If a cell is '1' and a '2' can be placed to its right, it's modified; otherwise, the original cell is kept.
6. **`merge(...)`**: Combines all modified objects.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the merged objects back onto the input grid `I`.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_cell(obj, v, i, j):
    return (2, (i, j + 1)) if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (1, (i, j + 1)) not in obj else (v, (i, j))
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({process_cell(obj, v, i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_cell(obj, v, i, j)`**:  A function is defined to process each cell of an object, applying the transformation logic.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
3. **`{process_cell(...) for v, (i, j) in obj}`**:  Applies the `process_cell` function to each cell within each object.
4. **`frozenset({...})`**:  Creates a new object from the processed cells.
5. **`merge({...})`**: Combines all modified objects into a single set.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the merged, modified objects onto the input grid `I`.
