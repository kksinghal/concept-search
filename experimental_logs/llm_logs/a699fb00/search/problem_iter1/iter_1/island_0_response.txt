## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background digit '0') and extending them to the right by adding a '2' digit next to each '1' digit within the object. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 
- There are two objects formed by '1's.
- In both objects, a single '2' is added to the right of each '1'.

**Input_1:** 
-  Again, two objects are formed by '1's.
- Similar to Input_0, a single '2' is added to the right of every '1' in both objects.

**Input_2:** 
-  Three objects are formed by '1's.
- The transformation remains consistent: a single '2' is added to the right of every '1' within each object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to perform the transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            if v == ONE and j < len(I[0]) - 1:
                I = fill(I, TWO, {(i, j + 1)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies objects formed by connected '1's, excluding the background '0'.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** It iterates through each object and its cells. If a cell contains '1' and isn't on the right edge, it fills the cell to its right with '2'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, TWO, mpapply(lambda x, y: (x, y + 1), *zip(*toindices(objects(I, T, F, T))))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Get Indices:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects and extracts their indices.
2. **Shift Indices:** It shifts the column index of each cell index to the right (`y+1`).
3. **Fill Grid:** It fills the grid 'I' with '2' at the shifted indices.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, {(TWO, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in merge(objects(I, T, F, T)) if v == ONE and j < len(I[0]) - 1})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Filter Cells:** It identifies objects, merges them, and filters for cells containing '1' that aren't on the right edge.
2. **Create New Object:** It creates a new object with '2' at the shifted indices.
3. **Paint on Grid:** It paints the new object onto the original grid 'I'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if (cell == ONE and j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == ZERO) else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** This version directly iterates through the grid, cell by cell.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** If a cell contains '1', isn't on the right edge, and the cell to its right is '0', it replaces the right cell with '2'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted =  tuple(
        tuple(
            ZERO if j == 0 else I[i][j - 1] 
            for j in range(len(I[0]))
        )
        for i in range(len(I))
    )
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if cell == ONE and shifted[i][j] == ONE else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:** Creates a shifted copy of the grid, where each row is shifted one position to the right.
2. **Compare and Replace:** Compares the original grid with the shifted grid. If a cell in the original grid is '1' and the corresponding cell in the shifted grid is also '1', it replaces the original cell with '2'.

Each version utilizes different DSL functions and approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
