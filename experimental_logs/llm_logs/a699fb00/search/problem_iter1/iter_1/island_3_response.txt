## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected '1's in the input grid and replacing the rightmost '1' of each object with a '2' in the output grid. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The top-left and bottom-left '1's form two separate objects. The rightmost '1' in each object is replaced by '2'.
* **Input_1:**  Multiple horizontally aligned objects of '1's are present. For each object, the rightmost '1' is replaced by '2'.
* **Input_2:** Objects are scattered with varying orientations.  The transformation consistently replaces the rightmost '1' within each object.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    O = paint(O, {(TWO, (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate over each object (`obj`) in the input grid, identified as connected components of '1's (excluding background).
3. **Paint Object:** Paint the current object onto the canvas.
4. **Replace Rightmost:** Identify the rightmost cell of the object and paint a '2' at that location on the canvas.
5. **Return Output:** Return the transformed canvas. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == ONE and (j == len(row) - 1 or I[i][j+1] == ZERO):
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i,j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** The program directly modifies the input grid (`I`) to produce the output (`O`).
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterate over each cell in the input grid.
3. **Rightmost Check:** If a cell contains '1' and it's either the last cell in the row or the next cell is '0', it signifies the rightmost '1' of an object.
4. **Replace with '2':** Paint a '2' at the identified rightmost cell.
5. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: (TWO, (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))), objs)
  return paint(I, rightmost_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Get a set of all objects in the input grid.
2. **Extract Rightmost Cells:** Use `mapply` to apply a lambda function that extracts the coordinates of the rightmost cell of each object and pairs it with the value '2'.
3. **Paint Rightmost Cells:** Paint the extracted rightmost cells with '2' onto the input grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0,1))
    O = paint(O, difference(obj, shifted_obj))
    O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, intersection(obj, shifted_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as input.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Iterate through each object in the input grid.
3. **Shift and Compare:** Shift the object one position to the right and find the difference and intersection with the original object.
4. **Paint:** Paint the different cells (leftmost of each object) with '1' and the intersection (rest of the object) with '2'. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return paint(
      I,
      mpapply(
          lambda obj: (TWO, (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))),
          objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
      )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **One-liner:** This program compresses the logic into a single line for conciseness.
2. **Identify and Replace:** It directly identifies objects, extracts their rightmost cells, and paints them with '2' onto the input grid to produce the output.


These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL.  Each version leverages different combinations of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
