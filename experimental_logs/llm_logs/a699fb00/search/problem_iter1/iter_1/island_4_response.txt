## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same digit excluding the background color) and painting a border of '2's around them, but only where the border touches the background. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- **Input:** Two objects (formed by '1's) exist on a background of '0's.
- **Output:** A '2' border is added to the right of each '1' within the objects, but only where the '1' is directly adjacent to a '0' background.

**Input_1:**

- **Input:** Multiple '1' objects on a '0' background, some objects are adjacent diagonally.
- **Output:**  Similar to Input_0, a '2' border is added to the right of each '1' within the objects only if it's beside a '0' background. Diagonal adjacency doesn't trigger the border painting.

**Input_2:**

- **Input:** More '1' objects with various spatial arrangements on a '0' background.
- **Output:**  Consistently applies the '2' border rule, demonstrating the transformation is position-independent within the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1)) if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I) else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all objects (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid `I`. `T, F, T` specifies that objects should be univalued, not consider diagonal connections, and exclude the background.
2. **`for obj in objects(...)`:** Iterates over each identified object.
3. **`for v, (i, j) in obj`:**  Iterates over each cell `(v, (i, j))` within the current object.
4. **`if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)`:** Checks if the cell to the right is within the grid bounds and if it's the background color.
5. **`(2, (i, j + 1)) ... else (v, (i, j))`:** If the condition holds, it paints a '2' to the right; otherwise, keeps the original cell value.
6. **`frozenset({...})`:** Creates a new object with the modified cells.
7. **`merge({...})`:** Merges the modified objects back into a single object representing the changes.
8. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the modified object onto the original input grid `I` to produce the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I) else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 1, but uses `apply` and a `lambda` function for more concise object modification.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(v, (i, j)) if j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] != mostcolor(I) else (2, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)}))
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 1, but checks if a cell is at the left edge or if its left neighbor is not the background color. If not, it paints a '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(2, (i, j)) if (j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)) or (i + 1 < len(I) and I[i + 1][j] == mostcolor(I)) else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)}))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version checks for both right and bottom neighboring cells being background color to apply the '2' border.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge({recolor(2, shift(obj, (0, 1))) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)})), 2)
```

**Explanation:**

- This version first creates a canvas filled with the background color. 
- It then shifts each object to the right by 1 and recolors it to '2'. 
- Finally, it uses `cellwise` to merge this shifted and recolored object with the original input, using '2' as the fallback value. 

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL. Each version leverages different functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL in solving this spatial reasoning task.
