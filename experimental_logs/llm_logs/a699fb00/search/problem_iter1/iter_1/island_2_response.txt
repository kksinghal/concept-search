## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit, excluding the background) and filling in the cells immediately surrounding those objects with the digit '2'. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 / Output_0:**  The '1' digits form two distinct objects. The transformation fills the cells directly above, below, and to the sides of each '1' object with '2', leaving the original input digits unchanged.

* **Input_1 / Output_1:** This example demonstrates the transformation on a larger scale with more objects.  The same logic applies â€“  identifying '1' objects and filling their immediate surroundings with '2'.

* **Input_2 / Output_2:** This example reinforces the pattern established in the previous examples. Notice that diagonal adjacency does not trigger the fill; only cells directly above, below, or to the sides are affected.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct code versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1 (Inspired by Program_A):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects, no diagonals, without background
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    surroundings = difference(
        merge(apply(lambda cell: neighbors(cell[1]), obj)),  # All neighboring indices
        merge(apply(toindices, objs))  # Indices of all objects
    )
    O = fill(O, 2, surroundings)  # Fill the surroundings with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all objects (connected components) in the input grid (`I`), considering only directly adjacent cells (no diagonals) and excluding the background.

2. **Iterate & Fill:** For each object (`obj`) found:
   -  `neighbors(cell[1])`:  Get the indices of all neighboring cells for each cell in the object.
   -  `merge(...)`: Combine the neighbor indices into a single set.
   -  `difference(...)`:  Subtract the indices of all objects from the neighbor indices, leaving only the surrounding cells.
   -  `fill(O, 2, surroundings)`: Fill the identified surrounding cells with the digit '2' in the output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 2 (Alternative Approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    for x, (i, j) in obj:
      for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]: # Direct neighbors
        new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
        h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
        if 0 <= new_i < h and 0 <= new_j < w: # Check bounds
          if index(I, (new_i, new_j)) == 0:
            filled = fill(filled, 2, {(new_i, new_j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, identify all objects in the grid.

2. **Iterate & Fill:** For each object, iterate through its cells:
   -  For each cell, iterate through its four direct neighbors (up, down, left, right).
   -  Check if the neighbor is within the grid bounds.
   -  If the neighbor's value is 0 in the original input, fill it with '2' in the output grid.

**Program Version 3 (Concise Approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return underfill(I, 2, 
                 difference(
                     merge(apply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objects(I, T, F, T))),
                     merge(apply(toindices, objects(I, T, F, T)))
                 )) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Get Their Outlines:**  Calculate the outlines (`delta`) of the indices of all objects.
2. **Remove Object Indices:** Subtract the indices of all objects from their outlines, leaving only the immediate surrounding cells.
3. **Fill Surrounding Cells:** Use `underfill` to fill the remaining indices (surrounding cells) with '2' in the input grid, only if they are background (0).

**Program Version 4 (Using `dneighbors`):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  to_fill = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      to_fill.update({(ni, nj) for ni, nj in dneighbors((i, j)) if index(I, (ni, nj)) == 0})
  return fill(I, 2, frozenset(to_fill))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid.
2. **Collect Surrounding Cells:** For each cell in each object, get its direct neighbors using `dneighbors` and add them to the `to_fill` set if their value in the input grid is 0.
3. **Fill Cells:** Fill the collected surrounding cell indices with '2' in the input grid.

**Program Version 5 (Functional Approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return underfill(
      I, 
      2, 
      mapply(
          lambda obj: difference(
              merge(apply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))), 
              toindices(obj)
          ),
          objects(I, T, F, T)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. **Get Surrounding Cells:** For each object:
   -  Get its indices using `toindices`.
   -  Get the direct neighbors of each index using `dneighbors`.
   -  Remove the object's own indices from the set of neighbors.
3. **Merge and Fill:** Merge the surrounding cells from all objects and use `underfill` to fill them with '2' in the input grid if they are background. 

These five program versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation in the given DSL. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL, allowing for multiple solutions to a single problem.
