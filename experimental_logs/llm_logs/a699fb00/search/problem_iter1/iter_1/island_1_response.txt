## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a '2' to the right of each '1' in the input grid. If a '1' is at the edge of the grid, no '2' is added. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Output:
```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_A's iterative approach):**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and j < w - 1:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output grid:** Create an empty grid `O` of the same size as the input `I` filled with zeros using `canvas`.
2. **Iterate through input grid:** Loop through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. **Check for '1' and add '2' to the right:** If a cell contains '1' and is not on the rightmost edge, add a '2' to its right neighbor in the output grid `O`.
4. **Copy non-zero values:**  If the current cell in `I` is not zero, copy its value to the corresponding cell in the output grid `O`.
5. **Return the output grid:** Return the transformed grid `O`.

**Version 2 (Utilizing `shift` and `cellwise` like Program_B):**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  shifted_indices = shift(ofcolor(I, 1), RIGHT)
  shifted_grid = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 2, shifted_indices)
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_grid, 0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find indices of '1's:** Identify the indices of all cells containing '1' in the input grid `I` using `ofcolor`.
2. **Shift indices to the right:** Shift these indices one position to the right using `shift` and store them in `shifted_indices`.
3. **Create a shifted grid:** Generate a new grid `shifted_grid` filled with zeros and place '2's at the `shifted_indices`.
4. **Combine grids using `cellwise`:** Use `cellwise` to combine the input grid `I` and `shifted_grid`. The function copies values from `I` unless the corresponding cell in `shifted_grid` is non-zero (in which case it copies the '2').
5. **Return the combined grid:** Return the resulting grid `O` as the output.

**Version 3 (Functional approach with `apply` and lambda functions):**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return tuple(apply(lambda row: tuple(v if j == len(row) - 1 else (2 if v == 1 and row[j+1] == 0 else v) for j, v in enumerate(row)), I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Apply transformation row-wise:**  Use `apply` to apply a lambda function to each row of the input grid `I`. 
2. **Lambda function for row transformation:** The lambda function iterates through each element `v` and its index `j` in the row.
3. **Conditional value assignment:** If the element is at the end of the row, its value remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the element is '1' and its right neighbor is '0', it's replaced with '2', else it keeps its original value.
4. **Return transformed grid:** The `apply` function returns the transformed grid as a tuple of tuples.

**Version 4 (Combining `hconcat` and list comprehensions):**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return tuple(hconcat((row[:len(row)-1], (0,)), ((2,) + row[1:] if row[0] == 1 else row,)) for row in I) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** Loop through each row in the input grid `I`.
2. **Split and analyze rows:**  For each row, it splits the row into two parts - all but the last element, and the last element replaced with 0.
3. **Conditional concatenation:** If the first element of the row is '1', it concatenates a tuple containing '2' and all elements of the row except the first one. Otherwise, it concatenates the original row.
4. **Concatenate and return:** The function then horizontally concatenates these two parts using `hconcat` and returns the resulting grid as a tuple of tuples.

**Version 5 (Leveraging `zip` for pairwise element comparison):**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v1 if j == len(row) - 1 else (2 if v1 == 1 and v2 == 0 else v1) for j, (v1, v2) in enumerate(zip(row, row[1:] + (0,)))) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** Similar to previous versions, it iterates through each row in the input grid `I`.
2. **Pairwise comparison using `zip`:** Within each row, it uses `zip` to create pairs of consecutive elements (current element and its right neighbor). A '0' is appended to the end of each row to handle the last element.
3. **Conditional value assignment:** For each pair `(v1, v2)`, if `v1` is '1' and `v2` is '0', `v1` is replaced by '2'. Otherwise, `v1` retains its original value.
4. **Return transformed grid:** The function returns the transformed grid as a tuple of tuples.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version leverages different functions and programming paradigms, providing a diverse set of solutions to the given problem.
