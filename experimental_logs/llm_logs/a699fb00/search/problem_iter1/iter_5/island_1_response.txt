## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts all "1" values in the input grid one position to the right, replacing the original position with a "2". If a "1" is at the rightmost edge of the grid, it remains unchanged. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The "1" at (0, 0) moves to (0, 1), leaving a "2" at (0, 0).
* The "1" at (3, 1) moves to (3, 2), leaving a "2" at (3, 1).
* The remaining "1" values are at the right edge and stay unchanged.

**Input_1:**

* The transformation follows the same logic as above.
* Notice that multiple "1" values in a row will shift sequentially, creating a trail of "2" values.

**Input_2:**

* Again, the transformation logic remains consistent.
* The placement of "1" values across different rows doesn't affect the individual shifts.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(
    I,
    fill(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      2,
      mpapply(
          lambda loc, d: add(loc, d), 
          sfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1),
          repeat(RIGHT, size(asindices(I)))
      )
    ),
    fallback=I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`sfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1)`**: This part identifies the indices of all cells containing "1".
2. **`repeat(RIGHT, size(asindices(I)))`**: This creates a tuple of `RIGHT` vectors with the same length as the number of indices.
3. **`mpapply(lambda loc, d: add(loc, d), ..., ...)`**: This applies the `add` function to each index and corresponding `RIGHT` vector, effectively calculating the shifted indices.
4. **`fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 2, ...)`**: This creates a new grid filled with "0" and then fills the shifted indices with "2".
5. **`cellwise(I, ..., fallback=I)`**: This combines the original grid and the grid with shifted "2" values. If both grids have the same value at an index, the original value is kept (due to `fallback=I`), otherwise, the value from the second grid is used.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      fill(I, 2, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1)),
      recolor(1, shift(ofcolor(I, 2), RIGHT))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1)`**: Identifies indices of all "1" values.
2. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`**:  Replaces all "1" values with "2".
3. **`ofcolor(I, 2)`**:  Gets the indices of all "2" values (which were originally "1").
4. **`shift(..., RIGHT)`**:  Shifts these indices one position to the right.
5. **`recolor(1, ...)`**:  Changes the color of these shifted indices to "1".
6. **`paint(..., ...)`**:  Applies these changes to the grid where "1" values were replaced with "2".

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(
      I, 
      hconcat(
          crop(canvas(0, shape(I)), (0, 1), subtract(shape(I), (0, 1))),
          ((0,) * height(I),)
      ),
      fallback=2
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(0, shape(I))`**: Creates a grid of zeroes with the same shape as the input.
2. **`crop(..., (0, 1), subtract(shape(I), (0, 1)))`**: Crops the canvas from the second column onwards, effectively removing the first column.
3. **`((0,) * height(I),)`**: Creates a column of zeroes with the same height as the input grid.
4. **`hconcat(..., ...)`**: Concatenates the cropped canvas and the column of zeroes, effectively shifting all columns one position to the right and filling the first column with zeroes.
5. **`cellwise(I, ..., fallback=2)`**: Merges the input grid with the shifted grid, using "2" as the fallback value. This ensures that "1" values are replaced by "2" in the original grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and j < len(row) - 1:
        shifted_grid = fill(shifted_grid, 2, {(i, j)})
        shifted_grid = fill(shifted_grid, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
      elif val == 1:
        shifted_grid = fill(shifted_grid, 1, {(i, j)})
  return shifted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))`**: Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate through the input grid**: Loop through each cell of the input grid.
3. **If a cell is 1 and not on the right edge**: Fill the corresponding cell in `shifted_grid` with "2" and the cell to its right with "1". 
4. **If a cell is 1 and on the right edge**: Only fill the corresponding cell in `shifted_grid` with "1".
5. **Return the shifted grid**.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1 else 1 if val == 1 else 0
            for j, val in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly constructs the output grid using nested list comprehensions.

1. **Outer loop**: Iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Inner loop**: Iterates through each value in the row.
3. **Conditional expression**: For each value, it checks:
    * If the current value is "1" and it's not the first element in the row (`j > 0`), and the previous element is "1", then replace it with "2".
    * If the current value is "1", keep it as "1".
    * Otherwise, keep it as "0".

This approach avoids explicitly using many DSL functions but achieves the same result. 

Each of these versions demonstrates a different way to accomplish the desired transformation within the constraints of the DSL. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
