## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects (connected components) of the digit '1' within the input grid. It then places the digit '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects, unless the '1' is already at the rightmost edge of the object.

**Input_0:**

- Two objects of '1' exist.
- In the top object, a '2' is placed to the right of the first '1'.
- In the bottom object, a '2' is placed to the right of both '1's.

**Input_1:**

- Seven objects of '1' exist.
- A '2' is placed to the right of each '1' in every object except for the rightmost '1' in each object.

**Input_2:**

-  Similar to Input_1, but with different object positions. A '2' is placed to the right of each '1' in every object except for the rightmost '1' in each object.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      TWO if j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO and any(I[k][j + 1] == ONE for k in range(len(I)) if k != i)  else cell
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**
This program iterates through each cell in the grid. It checks if a cell contains a '1' and its right neighbor is '0'. If true, it further checks if there is another '1' in the same column as the right neighbor. If all conditions are met, it places a '2' in the right neighbor's position, effectively adding a '2' to the right of '1' within objects, except for the rightmost '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(TWO, (i, j + 1)) for _, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(obj)}) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**
This version uses the `objects` function to identify objects of '1'. For each object, it iterates through its cells. If a cell is not at the rightmost edge of the grid and its right neighbor doesn't belong to the same object, it adds a cell with value '2' to the right. Finally, it paints these new cells onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j+1] == ZERO and any(I[k][j] == ONE for k in range(i+1, len(I))) else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:** This version simplifies the object detection. It iterates through the grid, and for each '1' with a '0' to its right, it only checks if there are other '1's in the same column *below* the current '1'. This implicitly handles object detection vertically.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if any(I[i][k] == ONE and I[i][k + 1] == ZERO and k + 1 == j for k in range(len(row) - 1)) else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**
This version iterates through each row and column and checks for the pattern of '1' followed by '0'. If the pattern is found, it places a '2' at the position of '0', achieving the desired transformation without explicitly using object detection functions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted = tuple(tuple(ZERO if j == 0 else I[i][j - 1] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            TWO if I[i][j] == ONE and shifted[i][j] == ONE and j < len(I[0]) - 1 else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )

```

**Explanation:**
This version creates a shifted copy of the input grid, shifting each row one position to the right. It then compares the original grid with the shifted grid. If a cell contains '1' in both the original and shifted grids, it signifies the '1' followed by '1' pattern. It then places a '2' to the right of this '1' in the output grid, achieving the desired transformation.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version offers a unique combination of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and power of the DSL in expressing spatial transformations.
