## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit, excluding the background color) and extending them to the right by one cell, but only if that cell is empty (contains a 0).

**Input_0:**
- Two objects are identified: the '1's.
- The top-right '1' is extended rightward, filling a '0'. 
- The bottom-left '1' is also extended, filling a '0'.

**Input_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, all '1' objects are extended rightward by one cell, filling in '0's.

**Input_2:**
- The same logic applies. Every '1' object is extended to the right by one cell if it can fill a '0'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: 
                         {(color(obj), (i, j + 1)) for _, (i, j) in obj 
                          if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0}, 
                         objects(I, T, F, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Identifies objects in the grid `I`, considering connected cells (T), excluding diagonals (F), and ignoring the background color (T).
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ... , objects(I, T, F, T))`**: Applies a function to each object found in the previous step.
3. **`{(color(obj), (i, j + 1)) ...}`**: For each cell `(i, j)` in the object, it creates a new cell one position to the right `(i, j + 1)` with the same color (`color(obj)`) under two conditions:
    - **`j + 1 < width(I)`**: Checks if the new cell is within the grid boundaries.
    - **`index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0`**: Checks if the cell to the right is empty (contains a '0').
4. **`merge(...)`**: Merges all the generated cells (representing the extensions) into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the merged set of cells onto the original grid `I`, effectively extending the objects.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               mapply(lambda obj:
                      {(color(obj), (i, j + 1)) for (i, j) in toindices(obj) 
                       if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0}, 
                      objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to version 1, but instead of iterating through the `(value, (i, j))` pairs of each object, it directly gets the indices using `toindices(obj)`.  
- It then uses `mapply` which combines `apply` and `merge` into a single step.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(I, 
               merge(frozenset({(color(obj), add(loc, (0, 1))) 
                      for loc in toindices(obj) 
                      if index(I, add(loc, (0, 1))) == 0 and add(loc, (0, 1))[1] < width(I)}) 
                      for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version first identifies all objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`. 
- It then uses a nested set comprehension to generate the extended cells. 
- The extension logic is similar to previous versions, using `add(loc, (0, 1))` to calculate the index of the cell to the right and checking for the '0' value.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               merge({(color(obj), (i, j + 1))
                      for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) 
                      for _, (i, j) in obj 
                      if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0}))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version streamlines the code further by combining the object identification and cell generation into a single set comprehension. 
- It iterates over each object and its cells, applying the extension logic within the comprehension.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               prapply(lambda i, j: (index(I, (i, j)), (i, j + 1)) 
                       if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0 else None, 
                       *(range(height(I)), range(width(I))))) 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version takes a different approach by using `prapply` to iterate over all cell indices in the grid. 
- For each cell, it checks if it's part of an object and if it can be extended rightward.
- If the conditions are met, it creates a new cell with the same color one position to the right; otherwise, it returns `None`, which is filtered out during the `paint` operation.


Each of these program versions achieves the same transformation using different combinations of DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
