## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background color 0) and extending them to the right by adding a single cell with the value 2. 

**Example:**

Let's analyze the transformation for Input_0:

**Input_0:**

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

**Output_0:**

```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

We can see that the objects formed by the digits '1' are extended to the right by a single cell containing the value '2'. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_right(obj):
    return {(TWO, (i, rightmost(obj) + 1)) for v, (i, _) in obj if rightmost(obj) + 1 < width(I)}
  return paint(I, merge(apply(paint_right, objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`paint_right(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input and returns a set of cells to be painted with the value `TWO`. It iterates through each cell `(v, (i, _))` of the object and calculates the column index of the cell to the right of the rightmost cell of the object (`rightmost(obj) + 1`). If this index is within the grid's width, it adds a cell with value `TWO` at that position.

2. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** This identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.

3. **`apply(paint_right, ...)`:** This applies the `paint_right` function to each object identified in the previous step.

4. **`merge(...)`:** This merges the sets of cells returned by `paint_right` for all objects into a single set.

5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** This paints the cells in the merged set onto the input grid `I`, resulting in the desired output.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(obj):
    return recolor(TWO, shift(rightmost(toindices(obj)), RIGHT))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_right, objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_right(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input and returns a new object representing the rightward extension. 
    - It first extracts the indices of the object using `toindices(obj)`.
    - Then it finds the rightmost index using `rightmost(...)`.
    - This index is then shifted one position to the right using `shift(..., RIGHT)`.
    - Finally, it recolors the shifted index to `TWO` using `recolor(TWO, ...)`.

2. The remaining steps are identical to Program Version 1, applying the `extend_right` function to each object, merging the results, and painting them onto the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_border(obj):
    return {(TWO, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == rightmost(toindices(obj))}
  return paint(I, merge(apply(right_border, objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_border(obj)`:**  This function identifies the rightmost cells of an object and creates a set of cells to the right of those cells with value `TWO`.

2. The rest of the program functions similarly to the previous versions, identifying objects, applying the transformation, and painting the results.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      if j == rightmost(obj):
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j+1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. For each object, it first paints the object onto a blank canvas `O`. 
3. Then, it iterates through each cell of the object, and if the cell is the rightmost cell of that object, it paints a '2' to the right of that cell.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({{(TWO, (i, j + 1)) for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if j + 1 < width(I)} for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)})) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version uses a nested set comprehension to achieve the transformation in a more compact way.
2. It iterates through each object, identifies its rightmost cells, and adds cells with value '2' to their right, merging the results and painting them onto the input grid.

Each of these program versions achieves the desired transformation for the given input-output pairs, demonstrating different approaches and function combinations within the provided DSL.
