## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying objects (connected groups of the same digit excluding the background color, 0) and extending them to the right by one cell, but only if that cell is empty (contains a 0).

**Example:**

In Input_0:

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

The objects are:

- A '1' object at the top left
- A '1' object at the bottom middle
- A '1' object at the bottom right

The transformation extends these objects one cell to the right:

```
1 2 1 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Note that only the rightmost '1's of each object are extended, and only if the cell to their right is empty.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify all objects in the grid
  extensions = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, (0, 1))) == 0, toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1)))), objs) # Find the empty cells to the right of each object
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda idx: {(index(I, idx), idx)}, extensions))) # Paint the extended cells with the object's color

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The `objects(I, T, F, T)` function identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Extension Points:** For each object, we shift it one cell to the right and then find the indices of cells that are empty (contain 0) in the original grid. This is done using a combination of `shift`, `toindices`, `sfilter` and `index`.
3. **Paint Extensions:** The `paint` function then paints the extension points with the corresponding object's color, effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), add(loc, (0, 1))) for loc in toindices(obj) if index(I, add(loc, (0, 1))) == 0}, objects(I, T, F, T)))) # Find empty cells to the right of each object and paint them

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Extensions:**  This version combines object identification and finding extension points into a single step. For each object, it iterates through its indices and checks if the cell to the right is empty. If it is, it marks this cell for extension.
2. **Paint Extensions:** The `paint` function then paints the extension points with the corresponding object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, shift(replace(I, 0, 9), (0,1)), I) # Shift grid right after replacing 0 with a temporary value, and then use cellwise comparison to restore original values except for extended objects

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace and Shift:**  This version takes a different approach by first replacing all empty cells (containing 0) with a temporary unique value (e.g., 9). It then shifts the entire grid one cell to the right.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** Finally, it uses the `cellwise` function to compare the original grid with the shifted grid. If the values match, it keeps the original value. If they don't, it indicates an object extension and keeps the shifted value (which is the object's color).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs)  # Shift all objects to the right
  return paint(I, merge(sfilter(lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0, merge(shifted_objs)))) # Paint on empty cells

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Shift Objects:**  This version first identifies all objects and then shifts each object one cell to the right using the `shift` function.
2. **Filter and Paint:** It then merges all the shifted objects and filters for cells that are empty in the original grid using `sfilter` and `index`. Finally, it uses the `paint` function to paint these filtered cells onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), (i, j + 1)) for _, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0}, objects(I, T, F, T))) # Find and paint the empty cells to the right of each object within the grid bounds

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Extensions within Bounds:** This version iterates through each object and its cells. For each cell, it checks if a right neighbor exists within the grid bounds and if that neighbor is empty. If both conditions are true, it marks this neighbor for extension.
2. **Paint Extensions:**  The `paint` function then paints the identified extension cells onto the original grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
