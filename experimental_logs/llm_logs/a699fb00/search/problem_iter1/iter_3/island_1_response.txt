## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves placing a '2' to the right of every '1' in each row of the input grid. 

**Let's analyze it step-by-step:**

1. **Identify '1's:** The program needs to find all occurrences of the digit '1' within the input grid.
2. **Rightward Placement:** For each identified '1', the program should place a '2' in the cell immediately to its right.
3. **Boundary Handling:**  The placement of '2' should be handled gracefully at the right edge of the grid. No '2' should be placed outside the grid boundary.
4. **Preservation of Other Elements:**  All other digits in the input grid should remain unchanged in the output grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if (j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1) else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly iterates through each row and cell of the input grid (`I`).  For every cell, it checks if the cell to its left contains a '1'. If true, it places a '2'; otherwise, it retains the original cell value (`v`). 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if ((i, j - 1) in ofcolor(I, 1) and j < w) else I[i][j] 
      for j in range(w)
    )
    for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `ofcolor` function to obtain the indices of all '1's in the grid. It then iterates through the grid and checks if the index to the left of the current cell is present in the set of '1' indices. If true and within the grid bounds, it places a '2'; otherwise, it uses the original cell value.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, shift(ofcolor(I, 1), (0, 1)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more functional approach. It first identifies the indices of all '1's using `ofcolor`. Then, it shifts these indices one position to the right using `shift`. Finally, it uses `recolor` to change the color at these shifted indices to '2' and paints it onto the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(
    I, 
    fill(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      2,
      shift(ofcolor(I, 1), (0, 1))
    ),
    fallback=I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input using `canvas`. It then fills the canvas with '2' at the locations shifted one position to the right of the '1's in the input grid. Finally, it merges this canvas with the input grid using `cellwise`, prioritizing the input grid values in case of overlaps.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(
        j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1,
        2,
        row[j]
      ) 
      for j in range(len(row))
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `branch` function to conditionally decide the value of each cell. It iterates through the grid and, for each cell, checks if the cell to its left is a '1'. If true, it places '2' using the `branch` function; otherwise, it places the original cell value.

These are five different ways to implement the required transformation using the provided DSL. Each version showcases a distinct approach and combination of functions.
