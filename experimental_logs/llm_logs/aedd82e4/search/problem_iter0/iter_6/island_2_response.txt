## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify specific cells within objects on the grid and change their value to 1.  Let's break down the pattern for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The bottom-leftmost cell of the non-background object is selected.

**Input_1:** The bottom-rightmost cell of each non-background object is selected.

**Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, the bottom-rightmost cell of each non-background object is selected.

**Input_3:**  The bottom-rightmost cell of the topmost non-background object is selected. 

**Overall Logic:**  The transformation focuses on selecting the bottom-rightmost cell within each object, with a slight variation in Input_3 where the topmost object takes precedence.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the described transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def bottom_rightmost_cell(obj):
    return argmax(toindices(obj), lambda cell: cell[0] * 100 + cell[1])
  
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target_cells = frozenset(bottom_rightmost_cell(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = fill(I, 1, target_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_rightmost_cell(obj)`:** This helper function identifies the bottom-rightmost cell within an object by maximizing a score that prioritizes higher row indices (`cell[0]`) and then rightmost column indices (`cell[1]`).
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  This extracts all non-background objects from the input grid.
3. **`target_cells`:** Applies the `bottom_rightmost_cell` function to each object to get a set of target cells.
4. **`fill(I, 1, target_cells)`:** Fills the target cells in the input grid with the value 1 to produce the output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h-1, -1, -1):  # Iterate rows from bottom to top
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})  # Fill if not background color
        break  # Move to the next row after filling
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate from Bottom-Right:** The code iterates through rows from bottom to top and then columns from left to right, prioritizing the bottom-rightmost cells.
2. **Fill on Non-Background:** If a cell's value is not the background color, it's considered part of an object, and its value is changed to 1.
3. **Break for Efficiency:** After filling a cell, the loop breaks to avoid modifying other cells in the same row, ensuring only the bottom-rightmost cell is targeted.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def is_bottom_right(grid, i, j):
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    return (i == h - 1 or grid[i + 1][j] == mostcolor(grid)) and grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid)

  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if is_bottom_right(I, i, j):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_bottom_right` Function:** This function checks if a cell at (i, j) is the bottom-rightmost cell of an object. 
2. **Iterate and Check:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid.
3. **Fill Bottom-Right:** If `is_bottom_right` returns True for a cell, the cell is filled with 1.


**Version 4:** 

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  def rightmost_in_bottom_row(obj):
    bottom_row = max(i for i, j in toindices(obj))
    return argmax(toindices(obj), lambda cell: cell[1] if cell[0] == bottom_row else -1)
  
  target_cells = frozenset(rightmost_in_bottom_row(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = fill(I, 1, target_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_in_bottom_row(obj)`:** This helper function identifies the rightmost cell within the bottom row of an object.
2. **Iterate through Objects:**  The code first extracts all non-background objects from the input grid. For each object, it finds the rightmost cell in its bottom row and collects these cells.
3. **Fill Target Cells:**  Finally, the collected cells are filled with the value 1 to generate the output grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def bottom_cells(grid):
    h = len(grid)
    return {(h-1, j) for j in range(len(grid[0])) if grid[h-1][j] != mostcolor(grid)}

  def process_object(grid, obj):
    bottom_right = argmax(toindices(obj) & bottom_cells(grid), lambda cell: cell[1])
    return fill(grid, 1, {bottom_right}) if bottom_right else grid

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = process_object(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_cells(grid)`:** This helper function identifies all cells in the bottom row of the grid that are not the background color.
2. **`process_object(grid, obj)`:** This function processes each non-background object. It first finds the rightmost cell within the object that is also in the bottom row of the grid. If such a cell exists, it fills that cell with 1.
3. **Iterate and Process:**  The code iterates through all non-background objects, applies the `process_object` function to each, and updates the grid accordingly. 

These five programs represent diverse approaches to achieving the observed transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic.
