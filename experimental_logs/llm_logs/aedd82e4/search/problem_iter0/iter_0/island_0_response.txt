## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the bottom-most object composed of '0's in the input grid. It then identifies the right-most '0' within this object and changes its value to '1' in the output grid. 

**Input 0:**
* The bottom-most '0' object consists of the bottom two '0's. 
* The right-most '0' in this object is at the bottom-center.

**Input 1:**
*  Two bottom-most '0' objects exist (bottom-left and bottom-right).
*  The right-most '0's are in the bottom row.

**Input 2:**
*  The bottom-most '0' object is a single '0' in the third row.

**Input 3:**
*  The bottom-most '0' object spans the bottom two rows.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions achieving the described transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    bottom_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 0 and lowermost(obj) == height(I)-1)
    if size(bottom_objs) > 0:
      target_obj = argmax(bottom_objs, size)
      target_loc = argmax(toindices(target_obj), lambda loc: loc[1])
      O = fill(I, 1, {target_loc})
    else:
      O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, True, True, False)` finds all connected objects in the grid, including background.
2. **Filter for bottom-most '0' objects:**  `sfilter` keeps only objects that are entirely composed of '0's and touch the bottom edge of the grid.
3. **Select largest object (if multiple):** `argmax(bottom_objs, size)` selects the largest object if multiple '0' objects exist on the bottom row.
4. **Find the right-most cell:** `argmax(toindices(target_obj), lambda loc: loc[1])` finds the cell within the target object with the highest column index.
5. **Fill with '1':** `fill(I, 1, {target_loc})` changes the value of the target cell to '1'.
6. **Return the modified grid:** If no bottom-most '0' objects are found, the original grid is returned.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for i in range(height(I)-1, -1, -1):
    row_obj = frozenset({(I[i][j], (i,j)) for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] == 0})
    if size(row_obj) > 0:
      target_loc = argmax(toindices(row_obj), lambda loc: loc[1])
      return fill(I, 1, {target_loc})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate rows bottom-up:** The code iterates through rows starting from the bottom.
2. **Create object for each row:**  For each row, a temporary object is created containing all '0' cells in that row.
3. **Check for '0' object:** If the temporary object is not empty, it means the row has at least one '0'.
4. **Find right-most '0':**  The right-most '0' is found within the row object.
5. **Fill and return:** The grid is modified by changing the right-most '0' to '1', and the modified grid is returned.
6. **Return original grid:** If no '0' is found in any row, the original grid is returned.

**Version 3:** (using recursion)

```python
def solve(I, row=None):
  if row is None:
    row = height(I)-1
  if row < 0:
    return I
  row_obj = frozenset({(I[row][j], (row,j)) for j in range(width(I)) if I[row][j] == 0})
  if size(row_obj) > 0:
    target_loc = argmax(toindices(row_obj), lambda loc: loc[1])
    return fill(I, 1, {target_loc})
  return solve(I, row-1) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize row:** If no row is provided, it starts from the bottom row.
2. **Base Case:** If the row index is negative (meaning all rows are checked), return the original grid.
3. **Create row object:** Same as Version 2, it creates a temporary object for '0's in the current row.
4. **Check for '0' object:** If the row object is not empty, find the right-most '0'.
5. **Fill and return:** Similar to Version 2, replace the right-most '0' with '1' and return the modified grid.
6. **Recursive call:**  If no '0' is found in the current row, recursively call the function for the row above. 

**Version 4:** (using `extract`)

```python
def solve(I):
  bottom_objs = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 0 and lowermost(obj) == height(I)-1)
  if bottom_objs:
    target_loc = argmax(toindices(bottom_objs), lambda loc: loc[1])
    return fill(I, 1, {target_loc})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find bottom-most '0' object:** `extract` finds the first (and should be only) object that consists of '0's and touches the bottom edge.
2. **Check if object exists:** If `bottom_objs` is not None (meaning an object is found):
3. **Find and replace:** Similar to previous versions, find the right-most '0' within the object and replace it with '1'.
4. **Return modified/original grid:** Return the modified grid if a bottom '0' object is found, otherwise return the original grid.

**Version 5:** (using `last`)

```python
def solve(I):
    bottom_row = last(I)
    target_j = None
    for j in range(len(bottom_row)-1, -1, -1):
        if bottom_row[j] == 0:
            target_j = j
            break
    if target_j is not None:
        O = fill(I, 1, {(len(I)-1, target_j)})
    else:
        O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract bottom row:**  `last(I)` gets the last row (bottom row) of the grid.
2. **Iterate bottom row from right to left:**  Iterate through the bottom row from right to left.
3. **Find right-most '0':** The first '0' encountered is the right-most '0' in the bottom row.
4. **Fill and return:** If a '0' is found, replace it with '1' and return the modified grid. Otherwise, return the original grid.


These five versions offer distinct approaches to solve the given transformation, showcasing the flexibility of DSL in achieving the same outcome through various logic and function combinations.
