## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify and recolor specific cells in the input grid based on the presence and position of non-background objects. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The bottom-left corner of the grid is recolored to '1'. This cell is the bottom-most cell of the left-most object.

**Input_1:** Two cells are recolored to '1'. The first is the bottom-most cell of the right-most object. The second is the left-most cell of the bottom-most object. 

**Input_2:** The right-most cell of the object in the third row is recolored to '1'.

**Input_3:** Two cells are recolored to '1'. The first is the right-most cell of the object in the second row. The second is the left-most cell of the object in the third row.

**Overall Pattern:**  The transformation consistently targets cells within objects that are at the extremes of their row or column. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" function, each leveraging a different approach to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Find all objects, excluding background
  bottom_left_cell = lambda obj: (lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj)) # Define function to find bottom-left corner
  target_obj = argmin(objs, lambda obj: bottom_left_cell(obj)[::-1]) # Find object with the bottom-left most corner
  target_cell = bottom_left_cell(target_obj) # Get bottom-left corner of the target object
  O = fill(I, 1, {target_cell}) # Fill the target cell with '1'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all distinct objects in the grid (excluding background).
2. **Find Bottom-Left Corner:** `bottom_left_cell` function returns the (row, column) coordinates of the bottom-left corner of an object.
3. **Locate Target Object:** `argmin` finds the object with the bottom-left most corner by comparing the reversed tuple output of `bottom_left_cell` (prioritizing column then row).
4. **Recolor Target Cell:** `fill` recolors the identified bottom-left cell with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Find all objects, excluding background
  target_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: leftmost(obj) == 0 or lowermost(obj) == len(I) - 1) # Filter for objects touching left or bottom border
  target_cells = mapply(lambda obj: {(lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))}, target_objs) # Get bottom-left and bottom-right corner of each target object
  O = fill(I, 1, target_cells) # Fill target cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Border Objects:** The code first identifies objects touching either the left or bottom border of the grid.
2. **Extract Target Cells:** For each of these objects, both the bottom-left and bottom-right corner cells are collected.
3. **Recolor:** The collected target cells are then recolored to '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != mostcolor(I) and (i == len(I) - 1 or j == 0 or j == len(row) - 1): # Check for non-background and border position
                O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)}) # Recolor if conditions met
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Border and Non-Background:** It checks if a cell is non-background and lies on the left, bottom, or right border of the grid. 
3. **Recolor:** If both conditions are true, the cell is recolored to '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Find all objects, excluding background
  leftmost_obj = argmin(objs, lambda obj: leftmost(obj)) # Find the left-most object
  bottom_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: lowermost(obj) == len(I) - 1) # Find objects touching the bottom border
  target_cells = {(lowermost(leftmost_obj), leftmost(leftmost_obj))} # Start with bottom-left of leftmost object
  target_cells |= {(lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)) for obj in bottom_objs} # Add bottom-right of bottom objects
  O = fill(I, 1, target_cells) # Fill target cells with '1'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Key Objects:** The code identifies the left-most object and all objects touching the bottom border. 
2. **Determine Target Cells:** It explicitly selects the bottom-left corner of the left-most object and the bottom-right corners of the bottom-touching objects.
3. **Recolor:** The selected cells are then recolored to '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = [list(row) for row in I] # Convert to mutable list of lists
    for j in range(w):
        for i in range(h - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate from bottom to top
            if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # Find first non-background cell from bottom in each column
                if j == 0 or i == h - 1: # If it's in the leftmost column or bottom row
                    O[i][j] = 1
                break  
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Bottom-Up Iteration:** The code iterates through columns, and within each column, it iterates from the bottom row to the top. 
2. **First Non-Background:** It finds the first non-background cell encountered in each column. 
3. **Left and Bottom Check:** If this first non-background cell is in the left-most column or the bottom row, it's recolored to '1'. 

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same grid transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
