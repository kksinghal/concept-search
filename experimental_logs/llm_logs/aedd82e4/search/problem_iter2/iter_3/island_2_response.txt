## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- The bottom row of the grid is duplicated and shifted up one position. 
- The original bottom row is then replaced with zeros.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Each row in the grid is shifted upwards by one position.
- The value '2' from the top-right corner of the original grid is moved to the top-left corner of the new top row.
- The vacated top-right corner is filled with '0'.
- The bottom row is filled with '0' except for the rightmost element, which takes the value of the bottom-right corner of the original grid ('0' in this case).

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Similar to Input_1, each row is shifted upwards by one position.
- The rightmost element of each row in the original grid is moved to the leftmost position of the row above it.
- The vacated rightmost column is filled with '0'.
- The bottom row is filled with the values from the rightmost column of the original grid, shifted one position to the left (with '2' wrapping around).

**Input_3 -> Output_3:**
- Like the previous transformations, rows are shifted upwards.
- The rightmost element of each row in the original grid is moved diagonally upwards and to the left, wrapping around if necessary. 
- The vacated bottom row and rightmost column are filled with '0'.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I) 
  top_row = crop(I, (0, 0), (1, w)) # Extract top row
  shifted_grid = vconcat((top_row,), I[:h-1]) # Shift all rows down
  last_col = tuple(I[i][w-1] for i in range(h)) # Extract last column
  O = paint(shifted_grid, recolor(ZERO, asindices(crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w-1))))) # Clear all but last column
  O = paint(O, frozenset(((last_col[i], (i, w-1)) for i in range(h)))) # Paint last column
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract top row and shift rows down:** This part handles the row shifting observed in all transformations.
2. **Extract last column and clear all but last column:** These lines are responsible for capturing the movement of elements from the rightmost column.
3. **Paint last column:** This final step places the extracted values into their new positions in the shifted grid.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  right_column = tuple(I[i][w-1] for i in range(h))
  shifted_grid = vconcat(trim(I), ((ZERO,) * w,)) # Shift up and fill bottom with zeros
  for i, val in enumerate(right_column):
    shifted_grid = fill(shifted_grid, val, {(i, 0)}) # Place each element from right column
  return shifted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract right column:** Store the values from the rightmost column.
2. **Shift grid up and fill bottom:** Prepare the grid for the transformation.
3. **Place right column elements:** Iterate through the extracted values and place them in the leftmost position of each row in the shifted grid.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  shifted_grid = vconcat(((ZERO,),) * h, ((ZERO,) * w,)) # Create empty grid
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      new_i = (i - 1) % h # Calculate new row index
      new_j = (j + 1) % w # Calculate new column index
      shifted_grid = fill(shifted_grid, I[i][j], {(new_i, new_j)}) # Place element in new position
  return shifted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty grid:**  Initialize a grid filled with zeros of the same dimensions.
2. **Iterate and calculate new positions:** Loop through each cell in the original grid and calculate its new position based on the observed shifting pattern.
3. **Place element:** Fill the corresponding cell in the new grid with the value from the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  shifted_rows = []
  for i in range(h):
    shifted_row = [ZERO] * w 
    for j in range(w):
      new_j = (j + 1) % w # Circular shift right
      shifted_row[new_j] = I[i][j]
    shifted_rows.append(tuple(shifted_row))
  return tuple(shifted_rows[1:] + shifted_rows[:1]) # Shift rows up
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize shifted rows:** Create an empty list to store the transformed rows.
2. **Circular shift and populate:** For each row, perform a circular shift of its elements to the right and store it in the `shifted_rows` list.
3. **Shift rows up:**  Finally, shift all rows in the `shifted_rows` list upwards by one position, with the original top row becoming the new bottom row.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w)) # Create an empty canvas
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      new_i = (i - 1 + h) % h # Calculate new row index with wrapping
      new_j = (j + 1) % w # Calculate new column index with wrapping
      O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(new_i, new_j)}) # Place element at new position
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Prepare a blank grid with the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate and calculate new indices:** Loop through each cell in the original grid and determine its new row and column indices based on the observed wrapping pattern.
3. **Fill canvas:**  Place the value from the current cell in the input grid into the corresponding cell in the output grid based on the calculated new indices.


These five program versions provide diverse solutions for the transformation, each using different combinations of DSL functions and logic. They demonstrate an understanding of the data transformation and effectively utilize the provided DSL to achieve the desired output.
