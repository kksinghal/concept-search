## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts objects formed by the digit '1' downwards, wrapping around the grid boundaries.  Other digits remain unchanged. Here's a breakdown per input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The '1' object is shifted one row down. The bottom '1' wraps around to the top row.
* **Input_1:**  The '1' object is shifted down, with the bottom '1' wrapping to the top.
* **Input_2:** The three connected '1's are shifted down, the bottom one wrapping to the top row.
* **Input_3:** The vertical '1' object is shifted down one row, wrapping the bottom '1' to the top.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)                   # Get indices of '1's
  shifted_indices = frozenset(((i + 1) % height(I), j) for i, j in one_indices)  # Wrap indices vertically
  O = fill(I, mostcommon(I), one_indices)        # Fill original '1' positions with background
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shifted_indices))     # Paint '1' at the shifted indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' positions:**  `ofcolor(I, 1)` finds the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Calculate shifted indices:**  For each '1' index (i, j), a new index `((i + 1) % height(I), j)` is calculated, effectively shifting it one row down and wrapping using the modulo operator.
3. **Clear original '1's:** `fill(I, mostcommon(I), one_indices)` replaces all '1's with the most common color in the grid, effectively clearing them.
4. **Paint at shifted indices:** `paint(O, recolor(1, shifted_indices))`  paints the value '1' at all the calculated shifted indices. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = rot270(vsplit(rot90(I), height(I))[0])  # Extract rightmost column, shift down, rotate back
  O = paint(cover(I, ofcolor(I, 1)), recolor(1, asindices(shifted_grid))) # Clear '1's, paint shifted column
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate and shift rightmost column:** The code rotates the grid to treat columns as rows, extracts the rightmost column (now the top row), shifts it down (implicitly by taking the top row after splitting), and rotates back to its original orientation.
2. **Clear and paint:** The original '1's are removed, and then the values from the shifted column are painted back onto the grid, effectively performing the wrap-around shift.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_row(row, i): # Helper function to shift a row
    return (i, j) if I[i][j] != 1 else ((i + 1) % height(I), j) 

  shifted_indices = frozenset(shift_row(row, i) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j in range(width(I)))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), recolor(1, shifted_indices)) # Paint on a new canvas
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `shift_row` function:** This function takes a row and its index. If a cell in the row is '1', it returns a shifted index (down one row, wrapping). Otherwise, it returns the original index.
2. **Apply shift to all cells:** The `shift_row` function is applied to all cells in the grid, generating a set of shifted indices.
3. **Paint on a new canvas:** A new canvas filled with the background color is created, and the '1's are painted at their shifted locations.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1) # Find objects of '1's
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (1, 0)) for obj in one_objs) # Shift each object down
  wrapped_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (-height(I), 0)) if uppermost(obj) == height(I) - 1 else obj for obj in shifted_objs) # Wrap around objects at the bottom
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(wrapped_objs)) # Paint on a new canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' objects:**  The code identifies objects formed by the digit '1'.
2. **Shift objects down:** Each '1' object is shifted one row down. 
3. **Wrap around:**  Objects that were shifted beyond the bottom row are moved back to the top, creating the wrap-around effect. 
4. **Paint on a new canvas:** The shifted and wrapped objects are painted onto a new canvas filled with the background color. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = [list(row) for row in I] # Create a mutable copy
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        target_i = (i + 1) % height(I) # Calculate wrapped row index
        O[target_i][j] = 1 # Set '1' at the new position
        O[i][j] = mostcommon(I) # Fill original with background
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O) # Convert back to immutable
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mutable copy:** The code creates a mutable copy of the grid to allow for in-place modifications.
2. **Iterate and shift:**  The code iterates through the grid. If it finds a '1', it calculates the new index after shifting down (with wrap-around) and updates the mutable copy accordingly.
3. **Return immutable grid:** Finally, the modified mutable copy is converted back to an immutable tuple of tuples, representing the transformed grid.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL functions.
