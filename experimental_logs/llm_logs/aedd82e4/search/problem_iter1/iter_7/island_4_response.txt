## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the bottom-most object in each grid and changes the color of its rightmost cell to 1. 

Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
```
0 2 2
0 2 2
2 0 0 
```

**Output_0:**
```
0 2 2
0 2 2
1 0 0
```

The bottom-most object consists of the two '2's in the bottom row. The rightmost cell of this object is the '2' at the bottom right corner. This cell's value is changed to '1'.

**Input_1:**
```
2 2 2 0
0 2 0 0
0 0 0 2
0 2 0 0
```

**Output_1:**
```
2 2 2 0
0 2 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
```

Two objects exist in the bottom row. The rightmost object, consisting of a single '2', is the target. Its rightmost (and only) cell is changed to '1'.

**Input_2:**
```
2 2 0 0
0 2 0 0
2 2 0 2
0 0 0 0
0 2 2 2
```

**Output_2:**
```
2 2 0 0
0 2 0 0
2 2 0 1
0 0 0 0
0 2 2 2
```

The bottom-most object consists of three '2's in the bottom row. The rightmost cell of this object is the '2' at the bottom right corner. This cell's value is changed to '1'.

**Input_3:**
```
2 2 0
2 0 2
0 2 0
```

**Output_3:**
```
2 2 0
2 0 1
0 1 0
```

Two objects exist in the bottom row. The rightmost object, consisting of a single '2', is the target. Its rightmost (and only) cell is changed to '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_cell_of_lowest_object(objs):
    lowest_row = lowermost(objs)
    return (1, (lowest_row, maximum({j for i, j in toindices(extract(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == lowest_row))})))
  return paint(I, {rightmost_cell_of_lowest_object(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_cell_of_lowest_object(objs)`:** This function takes a set of objects as input and returns the coordinates of the rightmost cell of the lowest object.
   - It first identifies the lowest row using `lowermost(objs)`.
   - Then, it extracts the object from the lowest row using `extract(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == lowest_row)`.
   - Finally, it finds the rightmost cell within this object using `maximum({j for i, j in toindices(...)})`.
2. **`objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** This identifies all distinct objects within the input grid.
3. **`paint(I, {rightmost_cell_of_lowest_object(...)})`: ** This function takes the input grid and paints the rightmost cell of the lowest object with the value '1'. 

This program directly targets the rightmost cell of the lowest object and modifies its value, effectively implementing the observed transformation. 

**Note:** This version utilizes nested function definitions for improved readability.
