## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces the color '3' with '8' in specific locations of the input grid:

* **Output_0:** Only the top-most '3's are replaced.
* **Output_1:**  The top-most '3's and the '3's connected to them in a rectangular shape are replaced.
* **Output_2:** Similar to Output_1, the top-most '3's and connected ones are replaced, but this time, the connection can be L-shaped.
* **Output_3:** Again, the top-most '3's and connected ones are replaced, and the connections can be more complex, forming various shapes.

Essentially, the transformation identifies '3's connected to the top of the grid and replaces them with '8's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1: Using Flood Fill Logic**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  
  def flood_fill(i, j):
    if 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and I[i][j] == 3:
      I[i][j] = 8
      flood_fill(i-1, j)
      flood_fill(i, j-1)
      flood_fill(i, j+1)

  for j in range(w):
    flood_fill(0, j)
  
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:** This version uses a recursive flood fill algorithm. It iterates through the top row, and if it finds a '3', it replaces it with '8' and recursively calls the flood fill function on its neighbors. This process continues until all connected '3's are replaced.

**Version 2: Using Object Detection and Manipulation**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  top_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == 0)
  merged_obj = merge(top_objs)
  recolored_obj = recolor(8, merged_obj)
  O = paint(I, recolored_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version first identifies all objects in the grid. Then, it filters for objects touching the top row. It merges these objects, recolors them to '8', and paints them back onto the original grid.

**Version 3:  Iterative Approach with Neighbors**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  visited = set()
  queue = [(0, j) for j in range(w) if I[0][j] == 3]

  while queue:
    i, j = queue.pop(0)
    if (i, j) in visited or not (0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w) or I[i][j] != 3:
      continue
    visited.add((i, j))
    I[i][j] = 8
    queue.extend([(i-1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)])

  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:** This version uses an iterative approach with a queue. It starts by adding all top-row '3's to the queue. It then iteratively processes each element in the queue, checking its neighbors and adding them if they are '3's and haven't been visited.

**Version 4: Utilizing Frontiers and Connected Components**

```python
def solve(I):
  frontiers = sfilter(frontiers(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  connected_components = mfilter(frontiers, lambda f: any(adjacent(f, obj) for obj in objects(I, False, False, False)))
  merged_obj = merge(connected_components)
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, merged_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes the concept of frontiers and connected components. It identifies all frontiers of color '3', finds the connected components touching these frontiers, merges them, recolors them to '8', and paints them back onto the original grid.

**Version 5: Combining Top Row Detection and Object Expansion**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  top_indices = {(0, j) for j in range(w) if I[0][j] == 3}
  expanded_indices = set(top_indices)
  for i, j in top_indices:
    expanded_indices |= dneighbors((i, j))

  O = tuple(
      tuple(8 if (i, j) in expanded_indices and I[i][j] == 3 else I[i][j] for j in range(w))
       for i in range(h)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version directly identifies the top row '3's, expands the selection to include their direct neighbors, and replaces the values in those indices with '8' while preserving the original grid structure.


These are five distinct programs using different logic and DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation. Each version demonstrates a different approach to solving the problem.
