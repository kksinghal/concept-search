## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors digits adjacent to a specific digit, but only if those digits belong to the same object (connected component). 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* **Target Digit:**  `1`
* **Adjacent Digit:** Any digit except `9`
* **Recolor to:** `8`
* **Logic:** All `1`s that are directly connected (not diagonally) and have at least one non-`9` neighbor are recolored to `8`.

**Input_1:**

*  Same logic as Input_0.

**Input_2:**

*  Same logic as Input_0.

**Input_3:**

*  Same logic as Input_0.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects without background
  def condition(obj):
    return color(obj) == ONE and any(index(I, n) != NINE for n in mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)))
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, obj) if condition(obj) else obj, objs)
  return paint(canvas(NINE, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects (connected components) from the input grid `I`, considering only direct neighbors (`F` for diagonal) and excluding the background (`T`).
2. **Define Recoloring Condition:**  `condition(obj)` checks if an object's color is `1` and if any of its directly neighboring cells in the original grid `I` are not equal to `9`. 
3. **Recolor Objects:** `apply` applies a lambda function to each object. The lambda function recolors the object to `8` if it meets the `condition`, otherwise, it keeps the object unchanged. 
4. **Construct Output:** A new canvas filled with `9`s is created.  `merge(recolored_objs)` combines all the recolored objects. Finally,  `paint` paints these merged objects onto the new canvas, resulting in the final output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_cell(i, j):
    if I[i][j] != ONE: 
        return I[i][j]
    neighbors_ = dneighbors((i, j))
    return EIGHT if any(0 <= n[0] < len(I) and 0 <= n[1] < len(I[0]) and I[n[0]][n[1]] != NINE for n in neighbors_) else ONE
  indices = asindices(I)
  return tuple(tuple(recolor_cell(i, j) for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `recolor_cell` Function:** This function takes cell indices `(i, j)` as input and determines the output color for that cell.
    - If the cell value is not `1`, it remains unchanged.
    - If the cell value is `1`, it checks its direct neighbors. If any neighbor is not `9`, the cell is recolored to `8`; otherwise, it remains `1`.
2. **Iterate and Apply:** The code iterates through all cell indices in the grid and applies the `recolor_cell` function to determine the output color for each cell, effectively creating the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(NINE, shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, obj) if color(obj) == ONE and any(neighbor != NINE for neighbor in mapply(lambda loc: index(I, loc), mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)))) else obj, 
                           objects(I, T, F, T))))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts connected components from the input, excluding the background.
2. **Recoloring Condition:** For each object:
    -  `color(obj) == ONE`: Checks if the object's color is `1`.
    - `any(neighbor != NINE ...)`: Checks if any direct neighbor of the object is not `9`.
3. **Recolor and Merge:** Objects satisfying the condition are recolored to `8` using `recolor(EIGHT, obj)`. All objects (recolored and unchanged) are then merged.
4. **Paint on Canvas:**  A new canvas filled with `9` is created. The merged objects are painted onto this canvas to generate the final output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def should_recolor(i, j):
    return I[i][j] == ONE and any(0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and I[ni][nj] != NINE 
                                   for ni, nj in [(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)])
  new_grid = canvas(NINE, shape(I))
  return tuple(tuple(EIGHT if should_recolor(i, j) else I[i][j] for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `should_recolor` Function:** This function takes cell coordinates `(i, j)` as input. It checks if the cell at `(i, j)` is `1` and if it has any direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are not `9`. If both conditions are true, it returns `True` (meaning the cell should be recolored), otherwise `False`.
2. **Create New Grid:** A new grid is created with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`, filled with `9`s.
3. **Iterate and Recolor:**  The code iterates over each cell of the input grid. For each cell, it calls the `should_recolor` function. If the function returns `True`, the corresponding cell in the new grid is set to `8`; otherwise, it keeps the original value from the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def recolor_condition(obj):
        return color(obj) == ONE and any(index(I, neighbor) != NINE for neighbor in mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)))
    recolored_grid = paint(canvas(NINE, shape(I)),
                           merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, obj) if recolor_condition(obj) else obj,
                                       objects(I, T, F, T))))
    return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`recolor_condition` Function:** This function determines if an object should be recolored. It checks if the object's color is `1` (`color(obj) == ONE`) and if any of its direct neighbors in the original grid are not `9` (`any(index(I, neighbor) != NINE ...)`).
2. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts connected components from the input, excluding the background.
3. **Apply Recoloring:** It applies the `recolor_condition` to each extracted object. If the condition is true, it recolors the object to `8` (`recolor(EIGHT, obj)`); otherwise, it keeps the object unchanged.
4. **Paint on Canvas:**  Creates a new canvas filled with `9`s (`canvas(NINE, shape(I))`).  It then paints the (potentially recolored) objects onto this canvas using `paint`.

These programs provide five distinct approaches to solve the transformation, each leveraging different combinations of DSL functions.
