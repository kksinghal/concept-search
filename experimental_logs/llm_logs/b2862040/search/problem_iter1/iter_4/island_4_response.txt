## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves recoloring cells adjacent to specific objects within the input grid. Here's a breakdown:

**General Logic:**

1. **Identify Target Objects:**  The transformation targets objects formed by the digit '1' within the grid. 
2. **Recolor Adjacent Cells:**  Cells directly adjacent (not diagonally) to the target objects are recolored to '8'.
3. **Preserve Other Cells:** All other cells in the grid retain their original values.

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' object in the center is surrounded by '9's. The transformation recolors these surrounding '9's to '8's.
* **Input_1:** Multiple '1' objects are present. The transformation recolors cells adjacent to each of these objects, regardless of their position or size.
* **Input_2 & Input_3:**  The logic remains consistent, recoloring cells adjacent to '1' objects while maintaining the structure of other objects.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to implement the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = 1
  recolor_value = 8
  target_objects = frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == target_color)
  adjacent_cells = frozenset(
      (i, j)
      for obj in target_objects
      for (a, b) in toindices(obj)
      for (i, j) in dneighbors((a, b))
  )
  return fill(I, recolor_value, adjacent_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Constants:** `target_color` (1) and `recolor_value` (8) for clarity.
2.  **Identify Target Objects:** `target_objects` stores objects formed by the `target_color`.
3.  **Find Adjacent Cells:** `adjacent_cells` gathers indices of cells directly neighboring any cell within the `target_objects`, utilizing `dneighbors`.
4.  **Recolor and Return:** `fill` recolors all `adjacent_cells` to `recolor_value` in the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_adjacent_to_one(cell):
      return any(
          manhattan(frozenset({cell}), obj) == 1
          for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
          if color(obj) == 1
      )
  return paint(
      I,
      frozenset(
          (8, (i, j))
          for i in range(len(I))
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
          if is_adjacent_to_one((i, j))
      ),
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Helper Function:** `is_adjacent_to_one` checks if a given cell is adjacent to an object formed by '1's using `manhattan` for distance calculation.
2.  **Iterate and Recolor:** The main function iterates through all grid cells, recolors those identified by `is_adjacent_to_one` to '8', and paints them onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_adjacent(obj):
    return recolor(8, toindices(obj))
  target_objects = frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 1)
  adjacent_objects = mfilter(target_objects, lambda obj: any(adjacent(obj, other_obj) for other_obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if other_obj not in target_objects))
  recolored = mapply(recolor_adjacent, adjacent_objects)
  return paint(I, recolored)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** `recolor_adjacent` recolors a given object to '8' using `recolor`.
2. **Filter Adjacent Objects:** `adjacent_objects` identifies objects directly adjacent to target '1' objects using `adjacent`.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** `recolor_adjacent` recolors each object in `adjacent_objects`, and `paint` applies the changes to the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def find_recolor_cells(obj):
    return frozenset(
          (i + di, j + dj)
          for (i, j) in toindices(obj)
          for (di, dj) in {(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)}
      )
  target_objects = frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 1)
  recolor_cells = mapply(find_recolor_cells, target_objects) 
  return fill(I, 8, recolor_cells) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Helper Function:** `find_recolor_cells` finds cells directly adjacent to a given object by iterating over its cell indices and adding predefined directional offsets.
2.  **Apply to Target Objects:** The main function identifies '1' objects, applies `find_recolor_cells` to each, merges the results, and uses `fill` to recolor the identified cells to '8' on the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_objects = frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 1)
  recolored_grid = I
  for obj in target_objects:
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for (di, dj) in {(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)}:
        new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
          recolored_grid = paint(recolored_grid, {(8, (new_i, new_j))})
  return recolored_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Recoloring:** This version iterates through each cell of the target '1' objects and recolors its directly adjacent cells to '8' using nested loops and direct grid manipulation with `paint`. Boundaries are checked to avoid out-of-bounds errors.


Each of these program versions implements the target transformation using different approaches and combinations of DSL functions. This showcases the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the provided DSL.
