## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying horizontal runs of the digit '1' and replacing them with the digit '8'. Individual instances of '1' are left unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** Horizontal runs of '1's in the input grid are replaced by '8's in the output grid. For example, the three consecutive '1's in the third row of the input become '8's in the output.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous example, horizontal runs of '1's are replaced by '8's. The transformation is evident in the second and fourth rows of the input and output grids.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Horizontal '1' runs are replaced with '8's as before. Note the transformation in the fourth and sixth rows of the input and output.

**Input_3 to Output_3:** Consistent with the previous examples, horizontal sequences of '1's are substituted with '8's. Observe the changes in the second and eleventh rows.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(NINE, shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == ONE and width(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(NINE, shape(I))` creates an output grid (`O`) filled with '9's, matching the input grid's dimensions.
2. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies connected regions (objects) of the same color in the input grid, excluding the background color ('9').
3. **Iterate and Transform:** The code iterates through each object:
    - **Condition:** `if color(obj) == ONE and width(obj) > 1:` checks if the object's color is '1' and its width is greater than 1 (indicating a horizontal run).
    - **Replace:** If the condition is met, `recolor(EIGHT, obj)` changes the object's color to '8', and `paint(O, ...)` draws the modified object onto the output grid.
    - **Preserve:** If the condition isn't met, the object is painted onto the output grid without modification.
4. **Return Output:** The function returns the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j+1] == ONE:
        O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, {(ONE, (i,j)), (ONE, (i, j+1))}))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Rows and Columns:** The code uses nested loops to iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Identify Horizontal Runs:**  `if I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j+1] == ONE:` This condition checks if the current cell and its right neighbor are both '1'.
4. **Replace with '8':** If a horizontal run is found, `recolor(EIGHT, {(ONE, (i,j)), (ONE, (i, j+1))})` creates a new object representing the two '1' cells and recolors it to '8'.  `paint(O, ...)` then draws this modified object onto the output grid.
5. **Return Output:** The function returns the transformed grid `O`. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(NINE, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    j = 0
    while j < len(row):
      if row[j] == ONE:
        start = j
        while j < len(row) and row[j] == ONE: 
          j += 1
        if j - start > 1:
          O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, {(ONE, (i, k)) for k in range(start, j)}))
      j += 1 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:**  Similar to version 1, an output grid `O` is created, filled with '9's and matching the dimensions of the input grid. 
2. **Iterate and Find Runs:** The code iterates through each row and uses a `while` loop to find consecutive '1's:
    - `if row[j] == ONE:`  If a '1' is found, it marks the start of a potential run.
    - The inner `while` loop continues as long as it encounters '1's.
3. **Replace Runs:**
    - `if j - start > 1:` checks if the run's length is greater than 1.
    - `recolor(EIGHT, {(ONE, (i, k)) for k in range(start, j)})` creates an object representing the run and recolors it to '8'.
    - `paint(O, ...)` draws the modified object onto the output grid. 
4. **Return Output:** The transformed grid `O` is returned.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
        if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and (ONE, (i, j + 1)) in obj:
          O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, j))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** `O` is initialized as a copy of `I`.
2. **Extract Objects:** It identifies connected regions (objects) in the input grid (`I`), excluding the background color.
3. **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** For each object that's color '1', the code iterates through its cells (`(i, j)`):
   - `if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and (ONE, (i, j + 1)) in obj:`: Checks if the current cell is not at the edge and its right neighbor is also part of the same object.
   - **Replace:** If the condition holds, the current cell is replaced with '8' in the output grid (`O`).
4. **Return Output:** The function returns the transformed grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    row = I[i]
    for j in range(len(row) - 1):
      if row[j] == ONE and row[j + 1] == ONE:
        O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, {(ONE, (i, j))}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, {(ONE, (i, j + 1))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Similar to version 2, `O` is initialized as a copy of `I`.
2. **Iterate and Check Consecutive '1's:** The code iterates through each row and checks for consecutive '1's.
3. **Replace with '8':** If consecutive '1's are found, both cells are individually replaced with '8' on the output grid using `paint` and `recolor`.
4. **Return Output:** The transformed grid is returned. 


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation. They showcase different ways of utilizing DSL functions for object manipulation and grid transformation.
