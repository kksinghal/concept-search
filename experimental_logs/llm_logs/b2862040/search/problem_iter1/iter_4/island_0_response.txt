## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently changes the color of specific '1' valued cells to '8' while leaving other '1' valued cells unchanged. Here's a breakdown:

* **Non-bordering Ones:** The transformation targets '1' valued cells that are NOT touching the outer border of the grid. 
* **Color Change:** These targeted '1' valued cells are recolored to '8'.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(grid):
  return paint(grid, recolor(8, toobject(intersection(asindices(grid) - outbox(asindices(grid)), ofcolor(grid, 1)), grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(grid, 1)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells in the grid with the value '1'.
2. **`asindices(grid) - outbox(asindices(grid))`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells within the grid that are not part of the outer border.
3. **`intersection(...)`:** Finds the common indices from the two sets above, resulting in indices of non-bordering '1's.
4. **`toobject(..., grid)`:**  Converts these indices back into an object, retrieving their original color values from the grid.
5. **`recolor(8, ...)`:**  Changes the color of the identified object to '8'.
6. **`paint(grid, ...)`:**  Applies the color change to the original grid, producing the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(grid):
  non_bordering_indices = asindices(grid) - outbox(asindices(grid))
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if (i, j) in non_bordering_indices and v == 1 else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`non_bordering_indices = ...`:** Calculates and stores indices of non-border cells.
2. **`tuple(tuple(...) ...)`:**  Iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
3. **`8 if ... else v`:**  For each cell, if it's a non-border cell and has a value of '1', it's changed to '8'; otherwise, the original value is kept.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if 0 < i < h - 1 and 0 < j < w - 1 and v == 1 else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = ...`:** Stores the height and width of the grid for easier use.
2.  **`tuple(tuple(...) ...)`:** Iterates over each cell in the grid.
3. **`8 if ... else v`:**  Changes the cell value to '8' only if it's a '1' and not in the first/last row or column.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(grid):
  return paint(grid, recolor(8, toobject(sfilter(ofcolor(grid, 1), lambda loc: all(0 < i < len(grid) - 1 and 0 < j < len(grid[0]) - 1 for i, j in neighbors(loc))), grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(grid, 1)`:** Gets indices of all '1' cells.
2. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters these indices, keeping only those where all neighboring cells are within the grid boundaries (not on the edge).
3. **`toobject(..., grid)`:**  Creates an object from the filtered indices.
4. **`recolor(8, ...)`:** Recolors the object to '8'.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** Applies the change to the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      grid = fill(grid, 8, obj)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:** Extracts all connected objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`for obj in objs ...`:** Iterates through each extracted object.
3. **`if color(obj) == 1:`:**  Checks if the object's color is '1'.
4. **`grid = fill(grid, 8, obj)`:** If the object's color is '1', it fills the corresponding grid locations with '8'.
5. **`return grid`:**  Returns the modified grid.

These five versions use different approaches and function combinations to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diverse solutions within the DSL.
