## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying connected components of the digit '1' within the input grid. However, there's a specific condition for recoloring these components to '8': 

* **Interior Components:** Only those components of '1' that are fully enclosed within a "border" of '9's are recolored. Components touching the grid edge, or having a direct path of '1's to the edge, are left unchanged. 

Let's analyze this with the input-output pairs:

* **Input_0:** A single interior component is recolored to '8'.
* **Input_1:** Two components are recolored. Notably, the bottom component extends to the edge, but its '1' path is blocked by '9's, making it eligible for recoloring. 
* **Input_2:** Similar to the previous cases, only the interior component of '1's is transformed.
* **Input_3:** This exemplifies the edge-touching rule. Multiple components touch the edge, so only the fully enclosed ones are recolored. 


## Program to be Generated (5 Versions)

**Version 1: Flood Fill Approach**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  visited = set()
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] == 1 and (i, j) not in visited:
        if is_interior_component(grid, (i, j), visited):
          grid = flood_fill(grid, (i, j), 8)
  return grid

def is_interior_component(grid, start, visited):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  queue = [start]
  is_interior = True
  while queue:
    i, j = queue.pop(0)
    visited.add((i, j))
    for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
      ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
      if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w:
        if grid[ni][nj] == 1 and (ni, nj) not in visited:
          queue.append((ni, nj))
      else:
        is_interior = False 
  return is_interior

def flood_fill(grid, start, new_color):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  old_color = grid[start[0]][start[1]]
  queue = [start]
  visited = set()
  while queue:
    i, j = queue.pop(0)
    if (i, j) in visited:
      continue
    visited.add((i, j))
    grid = fill(grid, new_color, {(i, j)})
    for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
      ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
      if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w:
        if grid[ni][nj] == old_color and (ni, nj) not in visited:
          queue.append((ni, nj))
  return grid

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`Program_to_be_generated(grid)`:**
   - Iterates through each cell of the grid.
   - For each '1', it checks if it's part of an unvisited interior component using `is_interior_component`.
   - If it's an interior component, it performs a flood fill (`flood_fill`) starting from that cell, changing '1's to '8's.

2. **`is_interior_component(grid, start, visited)`:**
   - Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the given 'start' cell.
   - Marks visited cells to avoid revisiting.
   - If, during the BFS, any edge cell is encountered, it marks the component as not interior.
   - Returns `True` if interior, `False` otherwise.

3. **`flood_fill(grid, start, new_color)`:**
   - Implements the flood fill algorithm, changing connected cells of 'old_color' to 'new_color'.


**Version 2:  Object-Based Approach**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, False)  
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1 and is_enclosed(obj, grid):
      grid = fill(grid, 8, toindices(obj))
  return grid

def is_enclosed(obj, grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for i, j in toindices(obj):
    if i == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == 0 or j == w - 1:
      return False
    for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
      ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
      if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and grid[ni][nj] != 1 and grid[ni][nj] != 9: 
        return False
  return True
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`Program_to_be_generated(grid)`:**
   - Finds all connected components ('objects') of the grid using `objects(grid, True, False, False)`.
   - For each object, if it's of color '1' and enclosed (`is_enclosed`), it fills the object's indices with '8' using `fill`.

2. **`is_enclosed(obj, grid)`:**
   - Checks if the object is fully surrounded by '9's.
   - If any object cell is on the grid edge or has a non-'1' and non-'9' neighbor, it's not enclosed.


**Version 3:  Border Detection**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  border = set()
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] == 9:
        border.add((i, j))
  for i in range(1, h - 1):
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
      if grid[i][j] == 1 and is_surrounded(grid, (i, j), border):
        grid = fill(grid, 8, {(i, j)})
  return grid

def is_surrounded(grid, cell, border):
  i, j = cell
  for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
    if (i + di, j + dj) not in border:
      return False
  return True

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Program_to_be_generated(grid)`:**
    -   Finds the border of '9's and stores their indices in the `border` set.
    -   Iterates through each inner cell (excluding the grid edge).
    -   If the cell is '1' and surrounded by the '9' border (`is_surrounded`), it's filled with '8'.

2.  **`is_surrounded(grid, cell, border)`:**
    -   Checks if all four neighbors of the given `cell` are part of the `border` set.


**Version 4:  Recursive Component Coloring**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  visited = set()
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] == 1 and (i, j) not in visited:
        if is_interior_recursive(grid, (i, j), visited):
          grid = color_component(grid, (i, j), 8, visited)
  return grid

def is_interior_recursive(grid, cell, visited):
  i, j = cell
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  if i < 0 or i >= h or j < 0 or j >= w or grid[i][j] != 1 or (i, j) in visited:
    return True
  visited.add((i, j))
  if i == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == 0 or j == w - 1:
    return False 
  return (is_interior_recursive(grid, (i + 1, j), visited) and
          is_interior_recursive(grid, (i - 1, j), visited) and
          is_interior_recursive(grid, (i, j + 1), visited) and
          is_interior_recursive(grid, (i, j - 1), visited))

def color_component(grid, cell, new_color, visited):
  i, j = cell
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  if i < 0 or i >= h or j < 0 or j >= w or grid[i][j] != 1 or (i, j) in visited:
    return grid
  visited.add((i, j))
  grid = fill(grid, new_color, {(i, j)})
  grid = color_component(grid, (i + 1, j), new_color, visited)
  grid = color_component(grid, (i - 1, j), new_color, visited)
  grid = color_component(grid, (i, j + 1), new_color, visited)
  grid = color_component(grid, (i, j - 1), new_color, visited)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Program_to_be_generated(grid)`:**
    -   Iterates over cells, similar to previous versions.
    -   Uses `is_interior_recursive` for checking interior components recursively.
    -   If interior, it colors the component using `color_component` recursively.

2.  **`is_interior_recursive(grid, cell, visited)`:**
    -   Recursively checks if the component connected to the `cell` is interior.
    -   Returns `False` immediately if an edge or non-'1' cell is encountered.

3.  **`color_component(grid, cell, new_color, visited)`:**
    -   Recursively colors the connected component starting from the `cell` to `new_color`.



**Version 5:  Two-Pass Border Expansion**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  grid = expand_border(grid, 9)
  grid = expand_border(grid, 8) 
  return grid

def expand_border(grid, color):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  new_grid = [list(row) for row in grid]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] == color:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_grid[ni][nj] == 1:
            new_grid[ni][nj] = color
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`Program_to_be_generated(grid)`:**
   - Calls `expand_border` twice:
     - First, to expand the '9' border inwards, overwriting adjacent '1's with '9'.
     - Second, to expand an '8' border from any remaining '1's that touch the (now expanded) '9' border. This effectively fills the interior components. 

2. **`expand_border(grid, color)`:**
   - Expands the border of the specified `color` by one cell inward, overwriting only '1' cells.
