## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces specific occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '8'. Analyzing the input-output pairs reveals the following pattern:

**Rule:** Any '1' that is part of a horizontally connected group of '1's gets replaced by '8'. Isolated '1's remain unchanged.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j+1] == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, j)), (EIGHT, (i, j+1))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = I` creates a copy of the input grid `I` as the output grid `O`.
2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. **Condition:** `if I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j+1] == ONE` checks if the current cell and its right neighbor are both '1'.
4. **Transformation:** If the condition is met, `paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, j)), (EIGHT, (i, j+1))})` replaces the values of the current and its right neighbor cell in the output grid `O` with '8'.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(NINE, shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == ONE and width(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = canvas(NINE, shape(I))` creates an empty grid `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with '9'.
2. **Object Detection:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)` identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
3. **Iteration and Transformation:** The code iterates through each identified object `obj`:
    - If the object's color is '1' and its width is greater than 1 (meaning it's a horizontal group of '1's), it gets recolored to '8' and painted onto the output grid `O`.
    - Otherwise, the object is painted onto the output grid `O` without modification.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    start = None
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        if start is None:
          start = j
      else:
        if start is not None:
          if j - start > 1:
            for k in range(start, j):
              O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, k))})
          start = None
    if start is not None and len(I[0]) - start > 1:
      for k in range(start, len(I[0])):
        O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, k))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  `O = I` copies the input grid `I` to the output grid `O`.
2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through each row `i` of the input grid.
3. **Horizontal Group Detection:**  For each row:
    - `start` tracks the starting column index of a potential horizontal group of '1's.
    - If a '1' is encountered, `start` is set to its column index if it's not already set.
    - If a value other than '1' is encountered and `start` is set (meaning a potential group was being tracked):
       - If the group length (j - start) is greater than 1, the corresponding cells in the output grid `O` are painted with '8'.
       - `start` is reset to `None`.
4. **End of Row Handling:** The code handles cases where a group of '1's extends till the end of the row.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j in range(len(row) - 1):
      if row[j] == ONE and row[j + 1] == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, k)) for k in range(j, find_end(row, j + 1))})
  return O

def find_end(row, start):
  for j in range(start, len(row)):
    if row[j] != ONE:
      return j
  return len(row)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = I` copies the input to the output.
2. **Iterating through Rows and Cells:**  Iterates through each row and cell of the input grid.
3. **Finding Consecutive '1's:** If a cell and its right neighbor are both '1':
    -  `find_end` function is called to find the end index of the consecutive '1's sequence.
    - All cells within this sequence are painted with '8' in the output grid.
4. **find_end Function:** Takes the row and the starting index as input. It iterates through the row from the starting index and returns the index of the first non-'1' value encountered. If the entire sequence from the starting index is '1's, it returns the length of the row.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(NINE, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    j = 0
    while j < len(row):
      if row[j] == ONE:
        group_end = j + 1
        while group_end < len(row) and row[group_end] == ONE:
          group_end += 1
        if group_end - j > 1:
          O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, k)) for k in range(j, group_end)})
        j = group_end
      else:
        j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates an output grid filled with '9's, matching the size of the input grid.
2. **Iterating and Identifying Horizontal '1' Groups:** Iterates through each row and uses a `while` loop to find consecutive sequences of '1's.
3. **Replacing with '8's:** If a group of '1's is longer than one cell, all cells within that group are replaced by '8's in the output grid.
4. **Skipping Processed Cells:** The loop index `j` is updated to skip the processed group of '1's, optimizing the iteration process.
