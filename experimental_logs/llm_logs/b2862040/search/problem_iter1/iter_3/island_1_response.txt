## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of '1's in the input grid and recoloring them to '8's if they are directly adjacent to a non-'9' cell. Objects are defined as connected groups of the same digit, where adjacency is considered only horizontally and vertically, not diagonally. The background color '9' and objects not fulfilling the adjacency condition remain unchanged.

**Example:**

Input: 
```
9 9 9 9 
9 1 1 9 
9 1 9 9 
9 9 9 9 
```

Output:
```
9 9 9 9 
9 8 8 9 
9 8 9 9 
9 9 9 9
```

Here, the object of '1's is recoloured to '8's because it is adjacent to a non-'9' cell (itself).


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background
  def condition(obj):
    return color(obj) == ONE and any(index(I, n) != NINE for n in mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)))
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, obj), sfilter(objs, condition)) 
  return paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))  # Paint recolored objects back onto the original grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background ('9').
2. `condition(obj)` checks if an object has color '1' and at least one directly adjacent cell is not '9'.
3. `sfilter(objs, condition)` keeps only objects that satisfy the `condition`.
4. `mapply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, obj), ...)` recolors the filtered objects to '8'.
5. `merge(...)` combines all recolored objects.
6. `paint(I, ...)` paints the recolored objects back onto the original grid `I`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def should_recolor(i, j):
    return I[i][j] == ONE and any(index(I, (ni, nj)) != NINE for ni, nj in dneighbors((i, j)) if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]))
  recolored_grid = tuple(tuple(EIGHT if should_recolor(i, j) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. `should_recolor(i, j)` checks if a cell at (i, j) should be recolored: it should be '1' and have at least one directly adjacent non-'9' neighbor within the grid boundaries.
2. The nested tuple comprehensions iterate through the grid, recoloring cells to '8' if `should_recolor` returns True, otherwise keeping the original value.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = toindices(merge(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)))
  recolor_indices = frozenset(n for loc in obj_indices for n in dneighbors(loc) if index(I, n) != NINE and 0 <= n[0] < len(I) and 0 <= n[1] < len(I[0]))
  return paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toobject(recolor_indices, I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `obj_indices` gets the indices of all cells belonging to objects with color '1'.
2. `recolor_indices` finds indices of cells adjacent to `obj_indices` that are not '9' and within grid boundaries.
3. `toobject(recolor_indices, I)` creates an object from `recolor_indices` using corresponding colors from grid `I`.
4. `recolor(EIGHT, ...)` recolors the created object to '8'.
5. `paint(I, ...)` paints the recolored object onto the original grid `I`.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    new_grid = canvas(NINE, shape(I)) # Create a canvas of '9's with the same shape as input
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == ONE and any(index(I, (ni, nj)) != NINE for ni, nj in dneighbors((i, j)) if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0])):
                new_grid = fill(new_grid, EIGHT, {(i, j)}) # Fill '8' at the current cell
            else:
                new_grid = fill(new_grid, val, {(i, j)}) # Otherwise, keep the original value
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(NINE, shape(I))` creates a new grid filled with '9's, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. For each cell containing '1', it checks if any directly adjacent cell is not '9'. If true, it fills the corresponding cell in `new_grid` with '8', otherwise, it keeps the original value from the input grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_condition(obj):
    return color(obj) == ONE and any(neighbor_val != NINE for neighbor in mapply(lambda loc: index(I, loc), mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))))
  
  recolored_grid = paint(canvas(NINE, shape(I)), 
                       merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, obj) if recolor_condition(obj) else obj, 
                                   objects(I, T, F, T))))
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. `recolor_condition(obj)`: This function checks if an object should be recolored. An object should be recolored if its color is `ONE` and at least one of its neighboring cells has a value other than `NINE`.
2. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: This function extracts all the objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
3. `apply(...)`: This function iterates through each object extracted in the previous step and applies a lambda function to it.
4. `lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, obj) if recolor_condition(obj) else obj`: This lambda function recolors an object to `EIGHT` if it satisfies the `recolor_condition`, otherwise it leaves the object unchanged.
5. `merge(...)`: This function merges all the objects (recolored and unchanged) back together.
6. `paint(canvas(NINE, shape(I)), ...)`: This function first creates a new grid filled with `NINE`s having the same shape as the input grid `I`. Then, it paints the merged objects onto this new grid.
7. `return recolored_grid`: Finally, the function returns the `recolored_grid`.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
