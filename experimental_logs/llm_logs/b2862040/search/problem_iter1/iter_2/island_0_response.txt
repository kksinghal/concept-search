## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' on the input grid and changing their color to '8', except for those objects that are directly touching the border of the grid.

**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Object Detection:** The transformation involves identifying connected regions of the digit '1'.  Two '1's are considered connected if they are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right). Diagonally touching '1's are not considered part of the same object.

2. **Bordering Check:** For each detected object, the transformation checks if any cell of the object lies on the edge of the grid (topmost row, bottommost row, leftmost column, or rightmost column).

3. **Color Change:** If an object is not bordering, all its '1's are replaced with '8's. Bordering objects remain unchanged.

## Program_to-be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint(grid, recolor(8, mfilter(objects(grid, True, False, True), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(grid, True, False, True)`: Detects all objects formed by the digit '1' on the grid (univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True).

2. `mfilter(..., lambda obj: not bordering(obj, grid))`: Filters the objects, keeping only those that do not touch the grid border using the `bordering` function.

3. `recolor(8, ...)`: Changes the color of the filtered objects to '8'.

4. `paint(grid, ...)`: Paints the re-colored objects onto the original grid, effectively replacing the original '1's with '8's for the non-bordering objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] == 1 and 1 < i < h - 1 and 1 < j < w - 1:
        if all(grid[x][y] != 1 for x, y in dneighbors((i,j)) - {(i-1,j),(i+1,j),(i,j-1),(i,j+1)} for _ in range(1)):
          grid = fill(grid, 8, {(i, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid. If a cell contains a '1' and is not on the border (checked using index bounds), it proceeds.

2. **Neighbor Check:** For each such cell, it checks its direct neighbors. If none of the neighbors are '1's, it implies this cell is an isolated '1' and should be changed to '8'.

3. `fill(grid, 8, {(i, j)})`: Replaces the isolated '1' at `(i, j)` with an '8'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  non_bordering_ones = asindices(grid) - outbox(asindices(grid))
  return paint(grid, recolor(8, toobject(intersection(non_bordering_ones, ofcolor(grid, 1)), grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `non_bordering_ones`: Calculates the indices of cells that are not part of the grid's outer border using `asindices` and `outbox`.

2. `ofcolor(grid, 1)`: Retrieves the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.

3. `intersection(..., ...)`: Finds the common indices between non-bordering cells and cells containing '1'.

4. `toobject(..., grid)`: Converts the resulting indices into an object, using color information from the original grid.

5. `recolor(8, ...)`: Changes the color of this object to '8'.

6. `paint(grid, ...)`: Paints the re-colored object onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      if all(index(grid, loc) != 1 for loc in outbox(obj)):
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(8, obj))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects:** This version iterates through each object found in the grid using `objects`.

2. **Check for Bordering:** It uses `outbox` to get the indices surrounding each object and then checks if any of those indices contain a '1' in the original grid using `index`. If no surrounding cell contains a '1', it means the object is not bordering.

3. `recolor(8, obj)` and `paint` functions are used to recolor and paint the non-bordering objects, similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))
  for i in range(1, h-1):
    for j in range(1, w-1):
      if grid[i][j] == 1:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 8, {(i, j)})
  return cellwise(grid, new_grid, grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Grid:** A new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid is created, filled with the background color using `canvas`.

2. **Fill Non-Bordering Ones:** The program iterates through the inner cells of the input grid (excluding borders). If a cell contains a '1', the corresponding cell in the new grid is filled with '8' using `fill`.

3. **Combine Grids:** Finally, `cellwise` combines the original grid and the new grid. If a cell in the new grid has been modified (contains an '8'), that value is used; otherwise, the original value from the input grid is kept.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic. Each version highlights the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
