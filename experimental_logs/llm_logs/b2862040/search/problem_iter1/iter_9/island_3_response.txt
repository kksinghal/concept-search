## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves two steps:

1. **Identifying and recoloring horizontal lines of '1's to '8's:**  This step closely resembles the logic in Program_A and Program_B. It iterates through the grid, identifies sequences of '1's longer than one cell, and replaces them with '8's.
2. **Preserving the original '1's that were not part of a horizontal line:** This is the key difference from the provided programs. We need to ensure that single '1's, or '1's forming vertical lines, remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(NINE, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if color(obj) == ONE and hline(obj):
      O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version leverages the `objects` function to identify connected components ('1's forming objects) in the grid. 
- For each object, it checks if it's a horizontal line (`hline(obj)`) of color '1'. If so, it recolors the object to '8' and paints it onto the output canvas.
- Otherwise, it paints the object with its original color, effectively preserving single '1's and vertical lines.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == ONE and (j == 0 or I[i][j-1] != ONE) and (j == len(row)-1 or I[i][j+1] != ONE):
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
      elif value == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through the grid cell by cell.
- For each cell containing a '1', it checks if it's part of a horizontal line by examining its left and right neighbors.
- If it's not part of a horizontal line (i.e., its neighbors are not '1's), it paints it onto the output canvas with its original color ('1').
- Otherwise, it paints it as an '8'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(NINE, shape(I))
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  for i, j in ones:
    if (i, j - 1) not in ones or (i, j + 1) not in ones:
      O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
    else:
      O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version first identifies all indices of '1's in the input grid.
- It then iterates through these indices and, for each one, checks if its left or right neighbor is also a '1'.
- If not, it paints a '1' at that index in the output grid, preserving the original '1'.
- Otherwise, it paints an '8'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(NINE, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      O = paint(O, recolor(branch(width(obj) > 1, EIGHT, ONE), obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to Version 1 but uses the `branch` function for a more concise condition.
- It identifies objects of '1's and checks their width.
- If the width is greater than 1 (horizontal line), it recolors the object to '8'; otherwise, it keeps the original color ('1').

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    O = paint(O, {(EIGHT if len(set(row[j:j+2])) == 1 and row[j] == ONE else ONE, (i, j)) for j in range(len(row)-1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through the grid row by row.
- For each row, it uses a list comprehension to check pairs of consecutive cells.
- If a pair contains two '1's, it paints the first cell of the pair as an '8' in the output. 
- Otherwise, it paints a '1', effectively preserving single '1's.


These are just a few examples, and you can explore various other combinations of functions from the DSL to achieve the same transformation. The key is to leverage the provided functions to identify horizontal lines of '1's while ensuring that other occurrences of '1' remain unchanged.
