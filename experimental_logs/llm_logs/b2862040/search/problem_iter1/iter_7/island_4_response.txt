## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation revolves around identifying cells adjacent to '1' (let's call them target cells) and replacing them with '8' in the output grid. However, there's a specific condition:

* **Condition:**  The target cell itself cannot be '9' to be replaced. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** Only cells adjacent to '1' and not being '9' themselves are transformed to '8'. Notice how the '1's themselves remain unchanged.

**Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the transformation consistently targets cells neighboring '1' while preserving the '1's and '9's.

**Input_2:**  The pattern holds â€“ cells directly next to '1' are changed to '8',  as long as they weren't initially '9'.

**Input_3:**  The transformation remains consistent across larger grids, reinforcing the adjacency-based rule and the condition regarding '9'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by `ahgfbffchiacegccicaebehebeehbedd` and `bbiffafgfecheidfbhhdaedeeaedaadf`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return apply(
      lambda row, i: tuple(
          8 if cell != 9 and any(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == 1 for di, dj in dneighbors((0, 0)))
          else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      ),
      zip(I, range(len(I)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`zip(I, range(len(I)))`**:  This creates pairs of each row in the input grid (`I`) along with its row index (`i`).

2. **`apply(lambda row, i: ...)`**:  We apply a function to each row-index pair.

3. **Innermost `if-else`**: For each cell in the row, we check:
   *  **`cell != 9`**: Is the current cell not equal to 9?
   *  **`any(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == 1 for di, dj in dneighbors((0, 0)))`**:  Is any of its direct neighbors ('dneighbors') equal to 1? 
   * **If both conditions are True**:  The cell is replaced with '8'.
   * **Otherwise**: The cell remains unchanged.

**Program Version 2:** (Focusing on object-based processing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_indices = mfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  return fill(I, 8, mapply(dneighbors, toindices(target_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`**:  Find all connected objects in the grid (`I`).
2. **`mfilter(..., lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)`**:  Filter for objects consisting only of '1's and merge them into `target_indices`.
3. **`mapply(dneighbors, toindices(target_indices))`**: Find all direct neighbors of the cells within those objects.
4. **`fill(I, 8, ...)`**: Fill the identified neighbor cells in the original grid with '8'.

**Program Version 3:** (Using direct cell iteration)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if cell != 9 and any(0 <= i + di < h and 0 <= j + dj < w and I[i + di][j + dj] == 1 for di, dj in dneighbors((0, 0)))
          else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and cells**: We directly iterate through each cell of the grid with nested loops.
2. **Check for '1' neighbors**: For each cell, we check if any of its direct neighbors within the grid bounds are '1'.
3. **Conditional replacement**:  If a cell has a '1' neighbor and is not '9' itself, it's replaced by '8'.

**Program Version 4:** (Leveraging `ofcolor` function)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 8, 
             frozenset(
               (i + di, j + dj)
               for i, j in ofcolor(I, 1) 
               for di, dj in dneighbors((0, 0))
               if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) and I[i + di][j + dj] != 9
             ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`**:  Find indices of all cells with the value '1'.
2. **Nested loop and condition**: For each '1' cell, iterate over its direct neighbors (`dneighbors`). If the neighbor is within grid bounds and not '9', include it in the set.
3. **`fill(I, 8, ...)`**:  Fill the collected indices in the original grid with '8'.

**Program Version 5:** (Combining object and cell approaches)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_cells = set((i, j) for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) if color(obj) == 1 for _, (i, j) in obj)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if (i, j) in target_cells and cell != 9
          else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find target cells**:  Identify all cells belonging to objects consisting only of '1's and store them in `target_cells`.
2. **Iterate and replace**: Traverse the grid cell by cell.  If a cell is in `target_cells` and is not '9', replace it with '8'.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the DSL constraints. Each version showcases a different aspect of the DSL and allows for flexibility in solving the problem.
