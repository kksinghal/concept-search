## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces specific occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '8' within the input grids.  Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

* **Horizontal Replacement:**  Any '1' that has another '1' immediately to its left is replaced by an '8'. 
* **Exclusion:** The rightmost '1' in a horizontal sequence of '1's is not replaced.

Let's illustrate with an example from Input_0:

```
Input_0 Row: 9 1 1 1 9 9 9 1 9 9 9
Output_0 Row: 9 8 8 8 9 9 9 1 9 9 9 
```

Notice how the first three '1's are transformed into '8 8 8', leaving the last '1' in the sequence unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(EIGHT if j > 0 and row[j-1] == ONE and row[j] == ONE else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:** 
This version iterates through each row and cell of the input grid `I`. For every cell, it checks if the current cell and the cell to its left are both '1'. If true, it replaces the current cell with '8', otherwise keeps the original value.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if (i, j - 1) in toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version utilizes object detection. It identifies objects formed by the digit '1'.  For each such object, it replaces a cell with '8' if it has a left neighbor belonging to the same object. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(branch(j > 0 and row[j] == ONE and row[j-1] == ONE, EIGHT, v) for j, v in enumerate(row))
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
This version uses the `branch` function for a more explicit conditional replacement. It iterates through rows and cells, applying the `branch` logic to replace '1's with '8's based on the left neighbor's value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(v if not (j > 0 and v == ONE and row[j-1] == ONE) else EIGHT for j, v in enumerate(row)) 
      for row in I
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**
This version utilizes Python's conditional expression within the list comprehension. It iterates through rows and cells, using the conditional expression to replace '1's with '8's based on the left neighbor.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(NINE, shape(I))  
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v == ONE:
        if j > 0 and row[j-1] == ONE:
          O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, j))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version iterates through the input grid, creating a new canvas initialized with '9'. It selectively paints '8' or '1' onto the canvas based on the left neighbor's value, effectively replicating the desired transformation.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
