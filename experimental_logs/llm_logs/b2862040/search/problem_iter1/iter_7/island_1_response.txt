## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all objects (connected groups of the same digit) in the input grid, except for the digit '1', to the digit '8'. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The object formed by digits '1' remains unchanged.
- All other digits ('9' in this case) forming other objects are replaced by '8'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Same logic as Input_0, recoloring all objects except those formed by '1' to '8'.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Same logic as previous inputs.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:**
- Same logic, demonstrating consistency across various input configurations.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(fill(I, EIGHT, asindices(I)), objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)`**: This identifies all objects in the input grid `I`. 
2. **`paint(..., ...)`**: This function takes two arguments: a grid and an object. It will "paint" the object onto the grid.
3. **`fill(I, EIGHT, asindices(I))`**: This creates a new grid filled entirely with the digit '8', using the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. **Combined Logic**:  The program first creates a canvas entirely filled with '8'. Then, it paints the original objects formed by any digit onto this canvas. Since '1' is the only digit not forming a separate object in any input, it remains unchanged, while all other digits are effectively replaced by '8'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, replace(I, ONE, EIGHT), EIGHT)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace(I, ONE, EIGHT)`**: Creates a temporary grid where all occurrences of '1' in the input `I` are replaced with '8'.
2. **`cellwise(I, ..., EIGHT)`**:  Compares the input grid `I` with the temporary grid. For matching cells, it retains the original value from `I`. For non-matching cells, it uses '8' (the third argument).
3. **Combined Logic**: This version directly compares the input grid with a modified version where '1' is replaced. This effectively keeps '1' unchanged and replaces all other digits with '8'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != ONE:
      I = fill(I, EIGHT, toindices(obj))
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(...)`**: Identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Looping**: Iterates through each identified object `obj`.
3. **`color(obj) != ONE`**: Checks if the object's color (digit) is not '1'.
4. **`fill(I, EIGHT, toindices(obj))`**: If the object's color is not '1', it fills the object's area with '8' in the grid.
5. **Combined Logic**: This version iteratively finds each object and recolors it to '8' only if it's not formed by the digit '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(EIGHT, shape(I)), colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), ONE)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(EIGHT, shape(I))`**: Creates a grid filled with '8' having the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`**:  Finds all objects in the grid.
3. **`colorfilter(..., ONE)`**: Filters the objects, keeping only those formed by the digit '1'.
4. **`paint(..., ...)`**: Paints the filtered objects (only '1' objects) onto the '8' filled canvas.
5. **Combined Logic**: This version creates an '8' filled canvas and then selectively paints only the '1' objects from the input onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  not_ones = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ONE))
  return fill(I, EIGHT, not_ones)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`**: Gets the indices of all cells in the grid.
2. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`**: Gets the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
3. **`difference(..., ...)`**:  Calculates the set difference, resulting in indices of cells that do not contain '1'.
4. **`fill(I, EIGHT, ...)`**: Fills the cells at the calculated indices (not containing '1') with '8'.
5. **Combined Logic**:  This version directly targets and recolors cells that don't contain '1' by calculating the difference between all cell indices and indices of cells containing '1'.
