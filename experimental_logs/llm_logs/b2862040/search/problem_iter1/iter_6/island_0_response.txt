## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' in the input grid. The key difference lies in how these objects are manipulated:

**Overall Pattern:**  The transformation retains the original object formed by '1's if it touches the border of the grid. Otherwise, it recolors the object to '8'.

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The central '1' object is recolored to '8' because it doesn't touch any border. The single '1's on the right edge remain unchanged.
* **Input_1:**  The large central '1' object is recolored to '8'. The '1' on the right edge and the three '1's on the bottom edge remain as '1's.
* **Input_2 & Input_3:** Follow the same pattern â€“ interior '1' objects are changed to '8', while those touching the border remain '1'. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  return paint(grid, recolor(8, toobject(sfilter(ofcolor(grid, 1), lambda loc: not bordering(frozenset({(1, loc)}), grid)), grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(grid, 1)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters the indices to keep only those that represent objects NOT touching the grid border. This uses `bordering` on a temporary object created with `frozenset({(1, loc)})` for each location.
3. **`toobject(...)`:** Converts the filtered indices back into an object representation.
4. **`recolor(8, ...)`:**  Recolors the identified object to '8'.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:**  Applies the recoloring to the original grid, effectively changing interior '1' objects to '8'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, grid):
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(8, obj))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:** Extracts all objects from the grid ('1' objects in this case, as they are the only non-background univalued objects).
2. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each extracted object.
3. **`if color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, grid):`:** Checks if the object is a '1' object and doesn't touch the border.
4. **`grid = paint(grid, recolor(8, obj))`:** If both conditions are met, the object is recolored to '8' and painted back onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1 and 0 < i < len(grid) - 1 and 0 < j < len(row) - 1:
        grid = fill(grid, 8, {(i, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(grid):`:** Iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **`for j, value in enumerate(row):`:**  Iterates through each cell in the current row.
3. **`if value == 1 and 0 < i < len(grid) - 1 and 0 < j < len(row) - 1:`:** Checks if the cell contains '1' and is not on any border of the grid.
4. **`grid = fill(grid, 8, {(i, j)})`:** If the conditions are met, the cell is filled with '8'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  interior = difference(asindices(grid),  outbox(asindices(grid))) 
  return paint(grid, recolor(8, toobject(intersection(ofcolor(grid, 1), interior), grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`outbox(asindices(grid))`:**  Gets the indices of the outer border of the grid.
2. **`interior = difference(asindices(grid), ...)`:** Subtracts the border indices from all grid indices, leaving only the interior indices.
3. **`intersection(ofcolor(grid, 1), interior)`:**  Finds the common indices between '1' cells and the interior indices.
4. **`toobject(...)`:**  Converts the intersected indices back into an object.
5. **`recolor(8, ...)`:** Recolors the object to '8'.
6. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** Applies the recoloring to the original grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      new_grid = branch(bordering(obj, grid), paint(new_grid, obj), paint(new_grid, recolor(8, obj)))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))`:**  Creates a new grid filled with the background color and the same dimensions as the input.
2. **`for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):`:**  Iterates through each '1' object in the grid.
3. **`if color(obj) == 1:`:** Checks if the object is a '1' object.
4. **`new_grid = branch(bordering(obj, grid), paint(new_grid, obj), paint(new_grid, recolor(8, obj)))`:** Conditionally paints the object onto the new grid. If the object borders the grid, it's painted as is (with '1'). Otherwise, it's recolored to '8' before painting. 

These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to achieving the same grid transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
