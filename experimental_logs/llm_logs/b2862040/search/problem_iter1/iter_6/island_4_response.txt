## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify digits adjacent to the digit '1' and replace them with the digit '8'. However, there's a key constraint: the digit '9' should remain unchanged, even if it's adjacent to '1'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 
- The '1' digits within the grid are surrounded by '9's and other '1's. 
- All adjacent '1's are replaced by '8's. 
- The surrounding '9's remain unchanged.

**Input_1:** 
- Similar to Input_0, adjacent '1's are replaced by '8's, but '9's are preserved.
- Notice the bottom-right corner: even though the '1' is at the edge, the adjacent '9' is not transformed.

**Input_2 & Input_3:**
- These examples further reinforce the pattern: adjacent '1's are replaced, while '9's are always protected from transformation.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if I[i][j] != 9 and any(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == 1 for di, dj in ((-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1))) 
          else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      ) for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**
- This program iterates through each cell in the grid.
- For each cell, it checks two conditions:
    - **Condition 1:** If the cell's value is not 9.
    - **Condition 2:** If any of its adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) have the value '1'. 
- If both conditions are met, the cell's value is replaced by '8'. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               frozenset(
                   (8, (i, j))
                   for i in range(len(I))
                   for j in range(len(I[0]))
                   if I[i][j] != 9 and any(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == 1 for di, dj in dneighbors((0, 0)))
               )) 
```

**Explanation:**
- This version utilizes the `paint` and `dneighbors` functions for a more concise solution.
- It identifies cells that are not '9' and have at least one directly adjacent neighbor (using `dneighbors`) with the value '1'.
- It then uses the `paint` function to directly replace the values of these cells with '8' on the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  neighbors_of_one = mapply(lambda x: dneighbors(x), ofcolor(I, 1))
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if (i, j) in neighbors_of_one and I[i][j] != 9 else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      ) for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**
- This approach first finds all indices of '1' using `ofcolor`.
- It then determines the direct neighbors of each '1' using `dneighbors` and merges them into a single set using `mapply`.
- Finally, it iterates through the grid, replacing a cell with '8' only if it's a neighbor of '1' and not equal to '9'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return apply(
      lambda row, i: tuple(
          8 if cell != 9 and any(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == 1 for di, dj in dneighbors((0, 0)))
          else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      ),
      zip(I, range(len(I)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**
- This version leverages the `apply` function along with `enumerate` for a more functional style.
- It iterates through each row and its index.
- For each cell in a row, it checks if it's not '9' and has an adjacent '1'. If true, it's replaced by '8'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def check_adjacent(i, j):
    return any(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == 1 for di, dj in dneighbors((0, 0)))

  return tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if I[i][j] != 9 and check_adjacent(i, j) else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      ) for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**
- This version introduces a helper function `check_adjacent` for readability.
- It iterates through each cell and uses the helper function to determine if it needs replacement based on the specified conditions.

These five programs provide distinct ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each leverages different function combinations and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL in solving this spatial reasoning problem.
