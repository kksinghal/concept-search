## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces digit '1' in the input grid with digit '8' if the '1' is part of a connected component (considering only horizontal and vertical adjacency) that is NOT directly adjacent to another connected component of '1's. 

Let's illustrate with Input_0 and Output_0:

- The top-left '1' in Input_0 at (2,1) remains unchanged in Output_0 because it's part of a connected component adjacent to another one at (5,7). 
- However, the isolated '1' at (5,7) in Input_0 changes to '8' in Output_0 because it's not directly adjacent to any other connected component of '1's.

This logic applies to all input-output pairs.

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_isolated(i, j):
    if I[i][j] != 1:
      return False
    for di, dj in dneighbors((0, 0)):
      ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
      if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 1 and (ni, nj) != (i, j):
        return False
    return True

  return tuple(
    tuple(
      8 if is_isolated(i, j) else I[i][j]
      for j in range(len(I[0])))
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_isolated(i, j)` function:** This function checks if a cell at (i, j) containing '1' is isolated, meaning it has no adjacent '1's.
2. **Iterating through the grid:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Conditional Replacement:** For each cell, if `is_isolated(i, j)` returns `True`, it replaces the cell value with '8', otherwise keeps the original value.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  isolated_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if all(manhattan(obj, other) > 1 for other in objs - {obj}))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, toindices(obj)), isolated_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It uses `objects` function to identify connected components of '1's.
2. **Filter Isolated Objects:** It identifies isolated objects by checking the Manhattan distance to all other objects.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** It recolors the isolated objects to '8' and paints them back onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def neighbors_have_one(i, j):
    for di, dj in dneighbors((0, 0)):
      ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
      if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 1:
        return True
    return False
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if I[i][j] == 1 and not neighbors_have_one(i, j)
          else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0])))
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`neighbors_have_one(i, j)` function:** Checks if a cell at (i, j) has any adjacent cell with value '1'.
2. **Iterating and Replacing:** It iterates through each cell and replaces '1' with '8' only if the cell does not have any adjacent '1's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded_I = ((9,) * (len(I[0]) + 2),) + tuple((9,) + row + (9,) for row in I) + ((9,) * (len(I[0]) + 2),)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if padded_I[i][j] == 1 and all(padded_I[i + di][j + dj] != 1 for di, dj in dneighbors((0, 0)))
          else I[i - 1][j - 1]
          for j in range(1, len(padded_I[0]) - 1))
      for i in range(1, len(padded_I) - 1)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Padding:** Adds a border of '9's around the grid to handle boundary cases.
2. **Checking Neighbors:** Iterates through the original grid and checks for isolated '1's using the padded grid.
3. **Replacing and Returning:** Replaces isolated '1's with '8's and returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if I[i][j] == 1 and all(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) != 1 for di, dj in dneighbors((0, 0)) if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]))
          else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0])))
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterating and Checking:** Iterates through each cell and checks if it is an isolated '1' by examining its neighbors using the `index` function and boundary checks.
2. **Replacing:** Replaces isolated '1's with '8's and returns the transformed grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic structures. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL while adhering to the specified functions.
