## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces specific occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '8' in the input grids. Let's break down the pattern:

* **Target '1's:** Only '1's that are part of an object (connected horizontally or vertically) are considered for replacement. Isolated '1's remain unchanged.
* **Replacement Condition:** The entire object of '1's is replaced with '8's only if it doesn't touch the border of the grid. 
* **Border Definition:** A '1' object is considered bordering if any of its cells are located in the first/last row or first/last column of the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I):
      I = fill(I, 8, toindices(obj)) 
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:**  The code iterates through each object in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, True, False, True)`. This function identifies connected components of the same color, excluding the background. 
2. **Check Color and Border:** For each object `obj`, it checks if its color is '1' (`color(obj) == 1`) and if it's not bordering the grid (`not bordering(obj, I)`).
3. **Fill with '8':** If both conditions are met, it fills the indices occupied by the object with '8' using `fill(I, 8, toindices(obj))`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(1, h - 1):
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and all(I[i + di][j + dj] != 9 for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]):
        I = fill(I, 8, {(i, j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Inner Grid:** The code iterates through the inner cells of the grid, excluding the borders.
2. **Check for '1' and Neighbors:** For each cell, it checks if it contains '1' and if all its directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) are not '9' (background).
3. **Fill with '8':** If both conditions are met, it implies the cell is part of a '1' object not touching the border, and the cell is filled with '8'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      indices = toindices(obj)
      if all(0 not in index and len(grid) - 1 not in index and 0 not in (j for i, j in indices) and len(grid[0]) - 1 not in (j for i, j in indices) for index in zip(*indices)):
        grid = fill(grid, 8, indices)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Check Border with Indices:** It extracts the indices of each object and directly checks if any index corresponds to a border row or column using `0 not in index`, `len(grid) - 1 not in index`, etc.
3. **Fill if Not Bordering:** If the object's indices don't touch the border, it fills them with '8'. 

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(8, mfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Objects:** It identifies objects with color '1' that are not bordering using `mfilter` and the provided lambda function.
2. **Recolor Objects:**  The `recolor` function replaces the color of the filtered objects with '8'.
3. **Paint Back:** It paints the recolored objects back onto the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1 and all(0 < i < len(grid) - 1 and 0 < j < len(grid[0]) - 1 for _, (i, j) in obj):
        grid = fill(grid, 8, toindices(obj))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Objects:**  Similar to other versions, it identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Check Border within Loop:** It directly checks if each cell's indices within a '1'-colored object satisfy the non-border condition (`0 < i < len(grid) - 1 and 0 < j < len(grid[0]) - 1`).
3. **Fill if Applicable:** If all cells in the object meet the condition, it fills the object with '8'.

These are just five examples, and you can come up with even more variations by combining different functions and logic from the DSL. The key is to understand the transformation and leverage the available functions to achieve the desired result.
