## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components) of the digit '1' within the input grid. Then, every cell within these objects, except for the rightmost cell in each row, is replaced with the digit '8'.

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 
- The input has a single object of '1's.
- All '1's except the rightmost one in each row of the object are replaced by '8's.

**Input_1:**
- This input features multiple objects of '1's.
-  Similar to Input_0, the transformation is applied to each object individually.

**Input_2 & Input_3:**
- These inputs further demonstrate the consistent application of the transformation across varying object shapes and positions within the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE and (j == len(I[0])-1 or I[i][j+1] != ONE):
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
      elif I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each cell in the grid.
- If a cell contains '1' and is either the last cell in the row or the next cell is not '1', it keeps the value as '1'.
- If a cell contains '1' and doesn't meet the previous condition, it changes its value to '8'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(NINE, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
        if j == rightmost(obj):
          O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a blank canvas filled with '9's.
- Identifies objects of '1's.
- For each '1' object, it paints '1' at the rightmost cell of each row and '8' for the rest.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      rightmost_indices = frozenset((i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)+1))
      O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, toindices(obj)-rightmost_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Identifies objects of '1's.
- For each '1' object, it calculates the indices of the rightmost cells.
- It then paints '8' to all indices within the object except the rightmost ones.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    ones_indices = frozenset((i, j) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == ONE)
    if ones_indices:
      O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, ones_indices - { (i, max(j for i,j in ones_indices)) }))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each row.
- Identifies indices of '1's in each row.
- Replaces all '1's with '8's except the rightmost '1' in each row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)+1):
        row_obj = frozenset((v, (a, b)) for v, (a, b) in obj if a == i)
        if len(row_obj) > 1:
          O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, toindices(row_obj) - {(i, rightmost(row_obj))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Identifies objects of '1's.
- For each object, iterates through its rows.
- If a row has more than one cell, it replaces all '1's with '8's except the rightmost one.
