## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and then highlighting specific cells within those objects. 

- **Highlighting Logic:** A cell within an object is highlighted if it is adjacent (not diagonally) to a cell outside the object.
- **Background Handling:** The background color (most frequent digit) remains unchanged.
- **Highlight Color:**  The highlighted cells are always changed to the digit '8'.

**Examples:**

- **Input_0:** The single '1' object has its border cells adjacent to the '9' background highlighted.
- **Input_1:** The large '1' object and the two smaller '1' objects all have their border cells highlighted. 
- **Input_2:** The transformation correctly identifies and highlights the border cells of the complex '1' object.
- **Input_3:** This example demonstrates that even with multiple objects, the highlighting logic is consistently applied.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               frozenset(
                   (8, (i, j))
                   for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) 
                   for (i, j) in toindices(obj)
                   if any(n in delta(obj) for n in dneighbors((i, j)))
               ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds all connected objects of the same digit, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate through Cells:**  The code iterates over each cell `(i, j)` within each identified object.
3. **Check for Adjacent Background:** `any(n in delta(obj) for n in dneighbors((i, j)))` checks if any direct neighbor of the cell is part of the background (i.e., not in the current object).
4. **Highlight:** If a cell has a background neighbor, it's highlighted by painting it with the value '8' using `paint` function. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 8, 
              frozenset(
                (i, j)
                for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
                for (i, j) in toindices(obj) 
                if any(index(I, n) != index(I, (i, j)) for n in dneighbors((i, j)))
              ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** Similar to version 1, `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies the objects.
2. **Iterate and Compare:** It iterates over each cell `(i, j)` in each object and compares its value with its direct neighbors using `index(I, n) != index(I, (i, j))`.
3. **Fill:**  If any neighbor has a different value (meaning it's a border cell), the `fill` function changes the cell's value to '8'.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, 
                  paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                        frozenset(
                          (8, (i, j)) 
                          for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) 
                          for (i, j) in toindices(obj) 
                          if any(n in delta(obj) for n in dneighbors((i, j))))),
                 I[0][0])
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` generates a grid filled with the background color and the same size as the input.
2. **Highlight on Canvas:**  It identifies and highlights the border cells on this blank canvas using logic similar to Version 1.
3. **Merge with Original:** `cellwise` merges the original grid (`I`) and the highlighted canvas. If the values match (both are the background color), the original value is kept. Otherwise, the highlighted value ('8') is used.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        8 if any(I[i + di][j + dj] != I[i][j] and 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) 
                 for di, dj in ((-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1))) 
             else I[i][j] 
        for j in range(len(I[0]))
      ) for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Iteration:** This version directly iterates through each cell `(i, j)` of the input grid.
2. **Neighbor Comparison:** For each cell, it compares its value to its direct neighbors, ensuring the neighbor indices are within the grid bounds.
3. **Conditional Highlighting:**  If a neighbor has a different value, indicating a border cell, the cell's value is changed to '8'. Otherwise, the original value is retained.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
        8 if (i > 0 and I[i - 1][j] != I[i][j]) or
           (i < len(I) - 1 and I[i + 1][j] != I[i][j]) or
           (j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] != I[i][j]) or
           (j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] != I[i][j]) 
           else I[i][j]
        for j in range(len(I[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Iteration and Comparison:**  Similar to Version 4, it iterates through each cell and directly compares its value with each of its four direct neighbors.
2. **Boundary Checks:** It incorporates boundary checks (`i > 0`, `i < len(I) - 1`, etc.) within the conditional statement to avoid index errors. 
3. **Conditional Replacement:** If any neighbor has a different value, the cell is highlighted with '8'. Otherwise, the original value is kept.

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
