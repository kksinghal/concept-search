## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently changes all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid to the digit '8' in the output grid.  This applies to all input-output pairs provided.

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, ONE, EIGHT)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program directly utilizes the `replace` function from the DSL. It takes the input grid `I` and replaces all occurrences of the value `ONE` (which is defined as 1 in the DSL) with the value `EIGHT` (defined as 8).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  target_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, obj), target_objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all objects within the grid using the `objects` function. It then filters for objects with the color `ONE`.  It then applies the `recolor` function to each of these objects, changing their color to `EIGHT`.  Finally, it paints the recolored objects back onto the original grid, effectively replacing all '1's with '8's. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `ofcolor` and `fill` functions.  It first identifies the indices of all cells in the grid `I` that have the color `ONE`. Then, it uses the `fill` function to change the value at these indices to `EIGHT`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) == ONE:
                O = fill(O, EIGHT, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. If the cell's value is `ONE`, it uses the `fill` function to change its value to `EIGHT` in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  f = lambda x: EIGHT if x == ONE else x
  O = tuple(tuple(f(v) for v in r) for r in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a lambda function `f` that takes a value and returns `EIGHT` if the value is `ONE`, otherwise it returns the original value. It then applies this function to each cell in the input grid `I` using nested tuple comprehensions to create the output grid `O`.

**Note:** All these versions achieve the same transformation of replacing '1's with '8's. They demonstrate the flexibility and various approaches possible within the DSL.
