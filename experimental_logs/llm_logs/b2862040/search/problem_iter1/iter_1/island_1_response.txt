## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors all instances of the digit '1' to the digit '8' in the input grid.

**Let's illustrate with Input_0 and Output_0:**

* **Input_0:** Contains multiple occurrences of the digit '1'.
* **Output_0:**  All occurrences of '1' from Input_0 are replaced with '8'. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.


## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1: Using `objects` and `recolor`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects excluding the background
  target_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)  # Filter objects with color '1'
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, obj), target_objs)  # Recolor filtered objects to '8'
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint the recolored objects back onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid (`I`), considering objects with uniform values (`T`), excluding diagonal connections (`F`), and disregarding the background (`T`).
2. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)`:**  Filters the extracted objects (`objs`) to keep only those where the `color` of the object is equal to '1'.
3. **`mapply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, obj), target_objs)`:** Applies the `recolor` function to each object in `target_objs`, changing their color to '8'.
4. **`for obj in recolored_objs: O = paint(O, obj)`:** Iterates through the `recolored_objs` and paints each object onto a copy of the input grid (`O`), effectively replacing the original '1' objects with '8' objects.


### Program Version 2: Direct Grid Manipulation

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])  # Get grid dimensions
    O = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]  # Create a mutable copy of the grid
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if O[i][j] == ONE:  # Check if cell value is '1'
                O[i][j] = EIGHT  # Replace '1' with '8'
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)  # Convert back to immutable tuples
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:**  Determines the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid.
2. **`O = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]`:**  Generates a mutable copy (`O`) of the input grid (`I`).
3. **`for i in range(h): for j in range(w): ...`:**  Iterates over each cell in the grid.
4. **`if O[i][j] == ONE: O[i][j] = EIGHT`:**  If a cell contains the value '1', it's replaced with '8'.
5. **`return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)`:** The modified grid `O` is converted back to immutable tuples before being returned.

### Program Version 3: Using `asindices` and `ofcolor`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_to_recolor = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Get indices of cells with color '1'
  O = I
  for i, j in indices_to_recolor:
    O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, j))})  # Paint '8' at each identified index
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`indices_to_recolor = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Retrieves the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the color '1'.
2. **`for i, j in indices_to_recolor: O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, j))})`:** Iterates through `indices_to_recolor`. For each index `(i, j)`, it paints a new object with color '8' at that specific location on the grid `O`.


### Program Version 4: Leveraging `replace` function

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return replace(I, ONE, EIGHT) # Directly replace all '1's with '8's
```

**Explanation:**

This concise version directly employs the `replace` function to substitute all instances of the value '1' with '8' in the input grid `I`.

### Program Version 5: Using `cellwise` function

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    dummy_grid = canvas(ONE, shape(I))  # Create a grid filled with '1's
    return cellwise(I, dummy_grid, EIGHT) # Replace non-matching cells with '8's
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`dummy_grid = canvas(ONE, shape(I))`:**  Creates a new grid (`dummy_grid`) of the same size as the input grid (`I`), filled entirely with the value '1'.
2. **`return cellwise(I, dummy_grid, EIGHT)`:**  Applies the `cellwise` function to the input grid (`I`) and `dummy_grid`. When corresponding cells in both grids have the same value, that value is retained. If they differ (meaning the cell in the input grid does not contain '1'), it's replaced with '8'.
