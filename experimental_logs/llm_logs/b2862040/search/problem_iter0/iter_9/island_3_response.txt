## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the color '1' with '8' in the input grid but only for the objects that are not touching the border of the grid. The border cells containing '1' retain their color. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_task(I):
  """Iterates through objects, recoloring if not bordering and color 1."""
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I):
      I = fill(I, 8, obj)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected objects in the grid `I`.  We use `True, False, False` to specify that objects are univalued, not diagonally connected, and include the background color.
2. **Filter and Recolor:** The code iterates through each object `obj`. If the `color(obj)` is 1 and the object is `not bordering(obj, I)` the grid, it recolors the object to 8 using `fill(I, 8, obj)`.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The function returns the modified grid `I`.


**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_task(I):
  """Uses cellwise comparison with a shifted mask to recolor."""
  O = shift(canvas(1, shape(I)), (1,1)) 
  O = cellwise(I, O, mostcolor(I)) 
  O = replace(O, 1, 8)
  O = cellwise(I, O, I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Shifted Mask:** `O = shift(canvas(1, shape(I)), (1,1))` creates a grid `O` of the same shape as input `I`, filled with '1's, but shifted by one unit in both directions. This shift ensures that the border of `O` aligns with the non-border cells of `I`.
2. **Isolate Non-Border '1's:** `O = cellwise(I, O, mostcolor(I))` compares `I` with the shifted mask `O`.  If both grids have '1' at the same position (indicating a non-border '1' in `I`), the cell retains '1'. Otherwise, it's filled with the background color (`mostcolor(I)`).
3. **Recolor and Merge:**  `O = replace(O, 1, 8)` replaces all remaining '1's in `O` (representing the non-border '1's in the original grid) with '8'. Finally,  `O = cellwise(I, O, I)` merges this result with the original grid `I`, using values from `I` as a fallback. This ensures that only the intended '1's are recolored.


**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_task(I):
  """Uses nested lambda functions to identify and recolor non-border '1's."""
  O = apply(
      lambda row: tuple(
          branch(
              bordering({(i, j)}, I), 
              v,  
              8 if v == 1 else v 
          ) for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ),
      enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:**  The code iterates through each cell in the grid using nested lambda functions with `apply` and `enumerate`. 
2. **Check for Border:** For each cell `(i, j)` with value `v`, it checks if it's a `bordering` cell.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:** If the cell is on the border, it keeps its original value (`v`). Otherwise, if its value is '1', it gets replaced with '8'; otherwise, it keeps its original value. 


**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_task(I):
  """Identifies non-border indices and directly modifies the grid."""
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = list(list(row) for row in I)  
  for i in range(1, h-1):
    for j in range(1, w-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O[i][j] = 8 
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Modifiable Grid:** Converts the input grid `I` into a list of lists `O` to allow for direct modification.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** Iterates through each cell from the second row and column (index 1) to the second-to-last row and column (index h-1 and w-1) of the grid. If a cell contains a '1', it is replaced with an '8'.
3. **Return as Tuple:** Converts the modified list of lists `O` back into a tuple of tuples (grid format) before returning.


**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_task(I):
  """Finds and recolors non-border '1' objects using object-based logic."""
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 1 and all(
        0 < i < len(I) - 1 and 0 < j < len(I[0]) - 1
        for i, j in toindices(obj)
    ):
      O = fill(O, 8, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects:**  Iterate through all objects in the input grid `I` using  `objects(I, True, False, False)`. 
2. **Check for Non-Border and Color:** For each object, check if its color is '1' and if all its cells are within the non-border region of the grid using `all` and the provided condition.
3. **Recolor Non-Border Objects:** If the conditions are met, recolor the object to '8' using `fill(O, 8, obj)`.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** The function returns the modified grid `O`.
