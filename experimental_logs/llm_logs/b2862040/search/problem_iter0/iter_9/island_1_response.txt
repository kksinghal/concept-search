## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all the examples is to change all occurrences of the digit "1" to the digit "8", except for the "1" digits that are vertically connected to the digit "9".

**Here's a breakdown for each Input-Output pair:**

* **Input_0:**  The "1" digits in the rightmost column are connected to a "9", so they remain unchanged. All other "1" digits are replaced with "8".
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the "1" digits in the rightmost column and the single "1" in the bottom left corner remain unchanged.  All other "1" digits are replaced with "8".
* **Input_2:**  The logic remains the same. "1" digits directly above or below a "9" are unchanged.
* **Input_3:**  The transformation is applied consistently across the larger grid. 


## Program_to_be_generated:


### **Program Version 1**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of '9's
  nines = ofcolor(I, NINE)
  # Find indices of '1's vertically connected to '9's
  connected_ones = mfilter(apply(vfrontier, nines), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE)
  # Replace all '1's with '8's
  temp = replace(I, ONE, EIGHT)
  # Replace the connected '1's back to '1' from '8'
  O = fill(temp, ONE, connected_ones)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '9' positions:**  `nines = ofcolor(I, NINE)` finds all indices where "9" is present.
2. **Find connected '1's:** `connected_ones = mfilter(apply(vfrontier, nines), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE)` identifies all "1" indices vertically aligned with the "9" indices. 
3. **Replace all '1's:** `temp = replace(I, ONE, EIGHT)`  replaces all occurrences of "1" with "8".
4. **Restore connected '1's:** `O = fill(temp, ONE, connected_ones)` fills the indices of the previously identified connected "1"s with "1" again, effectively undoing the replacement for those specific digits.


### **Program Version 2**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find objects connected to '9' vertically
  connected_objects = mfilter(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: vmatching(obj, ofcolor(I, NINE)))
  # Extract indices of '1's from those objects
  target_ones = mfilter(apply(toindices, connected_objects), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE)
  # Replace all '1's with '8's
  temp = replace(I, ONE, EIGHT)
  # Restore the connected '1's
  O = fill(temp, ONE, target_ones)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find connected objects:**  `connected_objects = mfilter(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: vmatching(obj, ofcolor(I, NINE)))` finds objects vertically connected to "9"s.
2. **Extract '1' indices:** `target_ones = mfilter(apply(toindices, connected_objects), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE)` extracts indices of "1"s within those connected objects.
3. **Replace all '1's:**  `temp = replace(I, ONE, EIGHT)` replaces all "1"s with "8"s.
4. **Restore connected '1's:** `O = fill(temp, ONE, target_ones)` restores the "1"s that were part of objects connected to "9"s.


### **Program Version 3**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find '1' indices
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Find '9' indices
  nines = ofcolor(I, NINE)
  # Find '1' indices NOT vertically connected to '9's
  unconnected_ones = ones - mfilter(apply(vfrontier, nines), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE)
  # Replace the unconnected '1's with '8's
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, unconnected_ones)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' and '9' indices:** `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)` and `nines = ofcolor(I, NINE)` find all indices of "1"s and "9"s respectively. 
2. **Identify unconnected '1's:**  `unconnected_ones = ones - mfilter(apply(vfrontier, nines), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE)` finds "1" indices that are *not* vertically connected to "9"s.
3. **Replace unconnected '1's:** `O = fill(I, EIGHT, unconnected_ones)` replaces only the "1"s that are not connected to "9"s with "8"s.


### **Program Version 4**

**Code:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Replace '1's not adjacent to '9' vertically with '8's
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE and not ((i > 0 and I[i - 1][j] == NINE) or (i < len(I) - 1 and I[i + 1][j] == NINE)):
        O = fill(O, EIGHT, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** The program iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for '1' and adjacent '9':** If a cell contains '1', it checks if a '9' exists directly above or below it.
3. **Replace if not connected:** If a '9' is not found directly above or below the '1', the '1' is replaced by '8'.

### **Program Version 5**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a function to check vertical connection to '9'
  def connected_to_nine(i, j):
    return (i > 0 and I[i - 1][j] == NINE) or (i < len(I) - 1 and I[i + 1][j] == NINE)

  # Apply the check and replace '1's accordingly
  O = tuple(
    tuple(
      EIGHT if I[i][j] == ONE and not connected_to_nine(i, j) else I[i][j] 
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    ) 
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `connected_to_nine` function:** This function checks if a given cell (i, j) has a '9' directly above or below.
2. **Nested tuple comprehension:** It uses nested tuple comprehension to iterate through each cell and apply the transformation.
3. **Conditional replacement:** For each cell, if it contains '1' and is not connected to '9' vertically, it's replaced with '8'. Otherwise, the original value is kept.

These program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, providing diverse solutions using the DSL functions.
