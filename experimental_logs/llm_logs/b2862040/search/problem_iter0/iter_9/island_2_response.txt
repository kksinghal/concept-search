## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic for all input-output pairs is consistent:

**Objective:** Recolor all objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid to '8' in the output grid, except for objects consisting of a single cell. Single-cell objects retain their original color.

**Example:**
Let's say an object is formed by the digit '1' in the input grid. If this object has more than one cell connected, all those cells will be replaced by '8' in the output. However, if a '1' exists in isolation, it will remain a '1' in the output.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") using the DSL from `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects, including background
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda x: size(x) > 1)  # Filter for objects larger than one cell
  x3 = mapply(lambda x: toindices(x), x2)  # Extract indices of larger objects
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, x3)  # Fill the indices of larger objects with '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. `objects(I, T, F, F)`: Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`. `T, F, F` specifies objects should be univalued, not diagonally connected, and include background.
2. `sfilter(x1, lambda x: size(x) > 1)`: Filters the objects from `x1`, keeping only those with a size greater than 1.
3. `mapply(lambda x: toindices(x), x2)`:  Converts the objects in `x2` to their corresponding indices within the grid.
4. `fill(I, EIGHT, x3)`:  Fills the input grid `I` at the indices specified by `x3` with the value '8'. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):  # Iterate over all objects
    if size(obj) > 1:  # Check if object size is greater than 1
      O = fill(O, EIGHT, toindices(obj)) # Recolor larger objects to '8'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. `O = I`: Initializes the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. `for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):`: Iterates over each object extracted from the input grid `I`.
3. `if size(obj) > 1:`:  Checks if the current object's size is larger than one cell.
4. `O = fill(O, EIGHT, toindices(obj))`:  If the object size is greater than 1, it fills the output grid `O` at the object's indices with '8'.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = asobject(I) # Convert grid to object representation
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda x: size(dneighbors(x[1])) == 4) # Find isolated cells (4 direct neighbors)
  x3 = mapply(lambda x: x[1], x2) # Extract indices of isolated cells
  x4 = asindices(I) # Get indices of all cells
  x5 = difference(x4, x3) # Get indices of non-isolated cells
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, x5) # Fill non-isolated cells with '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. `x1 = asobject(I)`: Converts the input grid `I` into an object representation.
2. `sfilter(x1, lambda x: size(dneighbors(x[1])) == 4)`:  Filters for isolated cells by checking if they have four direct neighbors.
3. `x3 = mapply(lambda x: x[1], x2)`:  Extracts the indices of the isolated cells.
4. `x4 = asindices(I)`: Generates a set of all cell indices in the input grid.
5. `x5 = difference(x4, x3)`:  Computes the difference between all cell indices and isolated cell indices, resulting in indices of non-isolated cells.
6. `O = fill(I, EIGHT, x5)`:  Fills the input grid `I` at the indices of non-isolated cells (`x5`) with '8'.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)  # Filter for single-cell objects
  x3 = mapply(lambda x: toindices(x), x2) # Get indices of single-cell objects
  x4 = asindices(I) # Get all indices
  x5 = difference(x4, x3) # Get indices of multi-cell objects
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, x5) # Fill multi-cell object indices with '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. `x1 = partition(I)`: Partitions the input grid `I` into a set of objects, where each object represents a connected region of the same digit.
2. `x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)`:  Filters the set of objects to retain only those with a size of 1 (single-cell objects).
3. `x3 = mapply(lambda x: toindices(x), x2)`:  Extracts the indices of these single-cell objects within the grid.
4. `x4 = asindices(I)`:  Gets the indices of all cells in the input grid.
5. `x5 = difference(x4, x3)`:  Calculates the difference between all cell indices and the indices of single-cell objects, giving the indices of multi-cell objects.
6. `O = fill(I, EIGHT, x5)`:  Fills the input grid `I` at the identified multi-cell object indices (`x5`) with '8'.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(EIGHT, shape(I))  # Create a canvas filled with '8'
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):  # Iterate over all objects
    if size(obj) == 1:  # Check if object is a single cell
      v, (i, j) = first(obj)  # Get value and location of the single cell
      O = fill(O, v, {(i, j)})  # Fill the canvas with the original value at that location
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. `O = canvas(EIGHT, shape(I))`: Creates a new grid `O` (the output) with the same shape as the input grid `I` and fills it entirely with '8's.
2. `for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):`:  Iterates through each object found in the input grid `I`.
3. `if size(obj) == 1:`:  Checks if the current object consists of only a single cell.
4. `v, (i, j) = first(obj)`: If the object is a single cell, this line extracts the value (`v`) and the row, column coordinates (`i`, `j`) of that single cell from the object.
5. `O = fill(O, v, {(i, j)})`: This line then fills the output grid `O` at the specific location (`i`, `j`) with the original value (`v`) that was present in the input grid at that location. 


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the DSL.
