## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying specific "objects" within the input grid and changing their color to '8'. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The object formed by the digit '1' that is not touching the border of the grid is identified and its color is changed to '8'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  Similar to the previous transformation, the '1' objects not touching the border are re-colored to '8'. Additionally, the bottom-most row of the grid, which consists entirely of '1's, remains unchanged, suggesting the transformation only affects objects above the bottom row.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** Again, the '1' objects not touching the border are re-colored to '8'. In this case, the object extends to the bottom row, but only the portion not touching the border is transformed.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:** The transformation is the same as before - recoloring non-border touching '1' objects to '8'. Here, the object is more complex, spanning multiple rows and columns, but the logic remains consistent.


## Code Generation:

Based on the transformation analysis, we need a program that identifies objects of a specific value (in this case, '1'), filters out those touching the grid border, and then recolors them to a target value ('8'). 

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Identify all objects in the grid
  not_bordering_one = lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I) # Define condition for non-bordering '1' objects
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, not_bordering_one) # Filter objects based on the condition
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), filtered_objs) # Recolor the filtered objects to '8'
  return paint(I, merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint the re-colored objects back onto the original grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Objects:**  The `not_bordering_one` lambda function checks if an object has a color of '1' and does not touch the grid border. `sfilter` uses this lambda function to filter out the desired objects.
3. **Recolor Objects:** `apply` applies the `recolor(8, obj)` function to each filtered object, changing their color to '8'.
4. **Paint Objects:** `merge` combines all the re-colored objects, and `paint` paints them onto the original grid, resulting in the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), 1) # Get all objects with color '1'
  inner_objs = sfilter(one_objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)) # Filter out objects touching the border
  indices_to_fill = mapply(toindices, inner_objs) # Get the indices of the filtered objects
  return fill(I, 8, indices_to_fill) # Fill the identified indices with '8'
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter by Color:** `colorfilter` is used to directly extract objects of color '1'.
2. **Filter by Border:**  `sfilter` filters out objects touching the border using the `bordering` function.
3. **Get Indices:** `mapply(toindices, inner_objs)` efficiently extracts the indices of all cells belonging to the filtered objects. 
4. **Fill Indices:** `fill` fills the extracted indices with '8' on the original grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  inner_one_indices = lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 1 and not bordering({(1, loc)}, I)  # Condition for inner '1' cells
  indices_to_change = sfilter(asindices(I), inner_one_indices) # Get all inner '1' indices
  return fill(I, 8, indices_to_change) # Fill the identified indices with '8'
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Inner '1' Cells:**  `inner_one_indices`  checks if a cell's value is '1' and if it's not on the border.
2. **Filter Indices:**  `sfilter` filters all grid indices (`asindices(I)`) using the `inner_one_indices` function to obtain the target indices.
3. **Fill Indices:** `fill` fills the identified indices with '8'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0]) # Get grid dimensions
  def is_inner_one(i, j):
    if I[i][j] != 1: 
      return False
    return 0 < i < h - 1 and 0 < j < w - 1 # Check if the cell is within the inner grid
  return tuple(tuple(8 if is_inner_one(i, j) else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates over each cell and uses the `is_inner_one` function to check if it's an inner '1'.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:**  If a cell is an inner '1', its value is changed to '8', otherwise the original value is retained.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  not_border_one = lambda i, j: I[i][j] == 1 and 0 < i < len(I) - 1 and 0 < j < len(I[0]) - 1
  indices = prapply(lambda i, j: (i, j) if not_border_one(i, j) else None, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))) 
  return fill(I, 8, frozenset(filter(lambda x: x is not None, indices)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Inner '1's:** `not_border_one` is a lambda function that identifies cells with value '1' that are not on the grid border.
2. **Generate Indices:** `prapply` applies `not_border_one` to all cell coordinates generated by the Cartesian product of row and column indices. It returns a set of tuples representing the indices of inner '1's.
3. **Filter None Values:** `filter(lambda x: x is not None, indices)` removes any None values from the set of indices.
4. **Fill with '8':**  `fill` uses the filtered set of indices to fill the corresponding cells in the input grid `I` with the value '8'.



These five programs represent distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version employs a different combination of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for this task.
