## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces specific occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '8' in the output grid. Let's break down the pattern for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** All occurrences of '1' are replaced with '8'.

**Pair 1:** Same as Pair 0.

**Pair 2:** Same as Pair 0.

**Pair 3:** Same as Pair 0.


## Code Generation:

Based on the analysis, the transformation aims to replace all occurrences of '1' with '8'. Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving this:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = replace(I, ONE, EIGHT)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`replace(I, ONE, EIGHT)`:** This function directly replaces all occurrences of the value `ONE` (which is 1) in the input grid `I` with the value `EIGHT` (which is 8).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = asobject(I)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda x: x[0] == ONE)
  x3 = toindices(x2)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, x3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the input grid `I` into an object representation.
2.  **`sfilter(x1, lambda x: x[0] == ONE)`:** Filters the object `x1` to keep only the cells with a value of '1'.
3.  **`toindices(x2)`:** Extracts the indices of the filtered cells.
4.  **`fill(I, EIGHT, x3)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the value `EIGHT` (8) at the specified indices `x3`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda o: color(o) == ONE)
  x3 = merge(x2)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, x3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`, considering each cell as an individual object (univalued=True), not allowing diagonal connections, and including the background.
2.  **`sfilter(x1, lambda o: color(o) == ONE)`:** Filters the objects to keep only those with the color '1'.
3.  **`merge(x2)`:** Merges the selected objects into a single patch.
4.  **`fill(I, EIGHT, x3)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the value `EIGHT` (8) at the indices of the merged patch.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = partition(I)
  x2 = extract(x1, lambda o: color(o) == ONE)
  O = paint(replace(I, ONE, EIGHT), x2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`partition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid `I` into objects based on cell values.
2.  **`extract(x1, lambda o: color(o) == ONE)`:** Extracts the object with the color '1'.
3.  **`replace(I, ONE, EIGHT)`:** Replaces all occurrences of '1' with '8' in the input grid.
4.  **`paint(..., x2)`:** Paints the extracted object `x2` back onto the modified grid, effectively undoing the replacement for the specific object that was originally '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, EIGHT, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2.  **Iterate through cells:** The nested loops iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3.  **`if I[i][j] == ONE:`:** Checks if the current cell value is '1'.
4.  **`O = fill(O, EIGHT, {(i, j)}):`:** If the current cell value is '1', it fills the output grid `O` with '8' at that specific cell location.



These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version employs a different set of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
