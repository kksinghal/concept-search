## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing specific occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '8' in the output grid. The selection criteria for which '1's to replace appears to be based on their spatial relationship with other digits, particularly the digit '9'. 

Let's break down each input-output pair for a more detailed understanding:

**Input_0:** The transformation replaces all '1's that are part of a connected region of '1's except for the single '1' located at the bottom right corner of that region.

**Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the transformation targets connected regions of '1's.  However, in this case, the replacement excludes '1's located on the rightmost edge of each connected region.

**Input_2:** The transformation exclusively targets '1's that are part of a connected region containing at least one '1' directly adjacent (above, below, left, or right) to a '9'.

**Input_3:**  This transformation combines the logic from Input_1 and Input_2. It replaces '1's within connected regions that are both adjacent to a '9' and not located on the rightmost edge of their respective regions.

## Code Generation:

Based on the transformation analysis, here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T) # Find connected regions of same digits excluding background
    x2 = colorfilter(x1, ONE) # Filter for regions containing only the digit '1'
    x3 = mapply(rightmost, x2) # Find the rightmost column index for each '1' region
    x4 = mapply(toindices, x2) # Get the indices of all '1's in each region
    x5 = lambda x: (x[0], x[1]-1) # Function to shift an index one position to the left
    x6 = mapply(apply, pair(x4, apply(x5, x4))) # Shift all indices one position left
    x7 = mfilter(x6, lambda x: x[1] not in x3) # Filter for shifted indices not on the rightmost edge
    O = underfill(I, EIGHT, merge(x7)) # Fill '8' at the filtered indices
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This program first identifies all connected regions of '1's. Then, for each region, it shifts all indices one position to the left. Finally, it replaces the original '1's with '8's at the shifted indices that are not on the rightmost edge of their respective regions. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    x2 = colorfilter(x1, ONE)
    x3 = mapply(dneighbors, ofcolor(I, NINE))
    x4 = mfilter(x2, lambda x: len(intersection(toindices(x), x3)) > 0)
    x5 = mapply(lambda x: remove(lrcorner(x), toindices(x)), x4)
    O = underfill(I, EIGHT, merge(x5))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**  This version first identifies all '1' regions and the indices of cells directly neighboring the digit '9'. It then filters for '1' regions that have at least one cell adjacent to a '9'. Finally, it replaces the original '1's with '8's at all indices within these filtered regions, except for the lower-right corner cell.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    x2 = colorfilter(x1, ONE)
    x3 = mapply(lambda x: subtract(lrcorner(x), (0, 1)), x2)
    x4 = mfilter(x2, lambda x: index(I, subtract(lrcorner(x), (0, 1))) == ONE)
    x5 = mapply(lambda x: remove(lrcorner(x), toindices(x)), x4)
    O = underfill(I, EIGHT, merge(x5))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**  This program identifies connected regions of '1's and checks if the cell to the immediate left of the lower-right corner of each region is also a '1'. If it is, it replaces all '1's in that region (except the lower-right corner) with '8's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    x2 = colorfilter(x1, ONE)
    x3 = mapply(lambda x: subtract(centerofmass(x), (0, width(x)//2)), x2)
    x4 = mfilter(x2, lambda x: index(I, subtract(centerofmass(x), (0, width(x)//2))) == ONE)
    x5 = mapply(lambda x: remove(lrcorner(x), toindices(x)), x4)
    O = underfill(I, EIGHT, merge(x5))
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This program identifies connected regions of '1's. For each region, it calculates the horizontal center and checks if the cell to the left of this center is also a '1'. If it is, it replaces all '1's in that region (except the lower-right corner) with '8's. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    x2 = colorfilter(x1, ONE)
    x3 = mapply(lambda x: {(i,j) for i, j in toindices(x) if i != uppermost(x)}, x2) # Remove top row
    x4 = mapply(lambda x: {(i,j) for i, j in toindices(x) if j != rightmost(x)}, x2) # Remove rightmost column
    x5 = mapply(intersection, pair(x3, x4))
    O = underfill(I, EIGHT, merge(x5))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**  This version first identifies connected regions of '1's.  It then removes the top row and the rightmost column from each region. Finally, it replaces the remaining '1's with '8's. 

This response provides a comprehensive analysis of the provided transformations and five distinct code versions to achieve them. Each version utilizes different combinations of DSL functions, offering diverse approaches to solving the problem.
