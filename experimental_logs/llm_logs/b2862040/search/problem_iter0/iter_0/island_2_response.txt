## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces specific objects with a new color (8) while leaving other digits untouched. 

**Object Definition:** An object is a connected group of digits with the same value, considering only direct (up, down, left, right) neighbors.

**Transformation Rule:**

* **Target Objects:** Objects with a size of 1 or 2 are targeted for replacement. 
* **Replacement:** Targeted objects are replaced entirely with the digit '8'.

Let's illustrate with an example from Input_1:

```
Input_1:                    Output_1: 
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9      9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 **1 1** 1 1 1 9 9 1 9 9      9 **8 8** 8 8 8 9 9 1 9 9
9 1 9 9 9 **1** 9 9 1 9 1      9 8 9 9 9 **8** 9 9 1 9 1
9 1 1 1 1 1 9 9 1 1 1      9 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 1 1 1
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9      9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 
...                         ...
```

The bolded '1' digits in Input_1 form objects of size 2 and 1, respectively. These are replaced by '8' in the Output_1.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, not considering diagonal connections
  x2 = sizefilter(x1, ONE)  # Filter for objects of size 1
  x3 = sizefilter(x1, TWO)  # Filter for objects of size 2
  x4 = merge((x2, x3))       # Combine objects of size 1 and 2
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, merge(apply(toindices, x4)))  # Fill combined objects with 8
  return O 
```

**Explanation:** This version directly uses `objects`, `sizefilter`, and `merge` to identify and combine the target objects. `toindices` retrieves the object's locations for the `fill` function to replace with '8'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I # Initialize output with input
  for size in (ONE, TWO):  # Iterate over target sizes
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate over all objects 
      if len(obj) == size:  # Check object size
        O = fill(O, EIGHT, toindices(obj)) # Replace object with '8' in output
  return O
```

**Explanation:**  This version iterates through possible object sizes and all objects in the input, replacing the target objects with '8' one by one. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: len(obj) <= TWO) # Filter for objects with size <= 2 
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, merge(apply(toindices, x2))) # Fill filtered objects with 8
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This program leverages the `sfilter` function to extract objects with a size less than or equal to 2 in a single step, making it more concise.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    x2 = lambda obj: len(obj) == ONE or len(obj) == TWO  # Define condition for object size
    x3 = sfilter(x1, x2)                              # Filter objects based on the condition
    O = fill(I, EIGHT, merge(apply(toindices, x3))) # Fill filtered objects with 8
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This version defines a lambda function `x2` to encapsulate the size condition for filtering, improving readability.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = mfilter(x1, lambda obj: toindices(obj) if len(obj) <= 2 else frozenset())  # Filter and merge indices directly
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, x2) # Fill filtered indices with 8
  return O
```

**Explanation:**  This program uses the `mfilter` function to combine the filtering and merging of object indices into a single operation, achieving greater conciseness.

These five programs showcase different ways to accomplish the same transformation using the DSL. Each utilizes a unique combination of functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
