## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in each input-output pair involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) within the input grid and recoloring them based on their size.  Specifically:

* **Objects of size 1:**  Remain unchanged.
* **Objects of size 2 or larger:** Recolored to the digit '8'.

Let's analyze each example:

**Example 0:** The input has several '1' objects. The single-cell objects remain '1's, while the larger ones become '8's.

**Example 1:** Similar to Example 0, single '1' cells are preserved, and larger '1' objects turn into '8's.

**Example 2:** This example highlights that the transformation is not limited to a specific digit.  Here, larger '1' objects are transformed into '8's, even though other digits ('1' and '9') exist in the grid.

**Example 3:** This reinforces the pattern seen in the previous examples, with larger '1' objects becoming '8's.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda x: size(x) > 1)
  x3 = merge(x2)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, x3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all objects in the input grid `I`. `T, F, T` configures the `objects` function to find connected regions of the same value (True), not considering diagonal connections (False), and excluding the background color (True).
2. **Filter by Size:** `x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda x: size(x) > 1)` keeps only the objects from `x1` that have a size greater than 1.
3. **Merge Objects:**  `x3 = merge(x2)` combines the indices of all filtered objects into a single set. 
4. **Fill with '8':** `O = fill(I, EIGHT, x3)` fills the input grid `I` with the digit '8' at the indices specified by `x3`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = fill(O, EIGHT, toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects:** This version iterates directly over each object found using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** For each `obj`, it checks `if size(obj) > 1`. If true, it fills the current output grid `O` with '8' at the object's indices using `fill(O, EIGHT, toindices(obj))`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = asobject(I)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda x: size(x[1]) > 1)
  x3 = mapply(lambda x: x[1], x2)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, x3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Grid to Object:** `x1 = asobject(I)` converts the input grid `I` into a single object representing the whole grid.
2. **Filter Cells:** `x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda x: size(x[1]) > 1)` filters the cells (value, index pairs) in `x1`, keeping only those belonging to objects with size greater than 1.
3. **Extract Indices:**  `x3 = mapply(lambda x: x[1], x2)` extracts the indices from the filtered cells.
4. **Fill with '8':** `O = fill(I, EIGHT, x3)` fills the input grid `I` with '8' at the extracted indices.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = partition(I)
  x2 = mfilter(x1, lambda x: size(x) > 1)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, x2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Grid:** `x1 = partition(I)` divides the input grid into objects where each object contains cells of the same value.
2. **Filter and Merge:** `x2 = mfilter(x1, lambda x: size(x) > 1)` filters the objects in `x1` to keep those with a size greater than 1 and then merges them into a single set of indices.
3. **Fill with '8':**  `O = fill(I, EIGHT, x2)` fills the input grid `I` with '8' at the indices of the filtered and merged objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = [(v, idx) for idx, v in enumerate(sum(I, ())) if v != mostcommon(sum(I, ()))] 
  x2 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda x: size(x) > 1)
  x4 = merge(x3)
  x5 = toindices(x4)
  x6 = difference(frozenset(i for _, i in x1), x5)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, x6) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Non-Background Cells:** `x1 = [(v, idx) for idx, v in enumerate(sum(I, ())) if v != mostcommon(sum(I, ()))]` identifies cells that are not the background color. 
2. **Identify Objects:** `x2 = objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all objects in the input grid.
3. **Filter Large Objects:** `x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda x: size(x) > 1)` keeps objects larger than one cell.
4. **Merge Indices:** `x4 = merge(x3)` combines the indices of the filtered objects.
5. **Extract Indices:**  `x5 = toindices(x4)` extracts the indices from the merged set.
6. **Find Difference:** `x6 = difference(frozenset(i for _, i in x1), x5)` finds the indices that are non-background but not part of the large objects.
7. **Fill with '8':** `O = fill(I, EIGHT, x6)` fills the input grid with '8' at the identified indices.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the language for solving this spatial reasoning task.
