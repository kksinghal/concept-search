## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves identifying objects made up of the digit '1' that are not touching the border of the grid. These objects are then re-colored to the digit '8'. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The central object formed by '1's is not touching the border and is recolored to '8'.
- The single '1' on the right border remains unchanged.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Several '1' objects exist, but only those not touching the border are recolored to '8'. 
- Objects touching the bottom and right borders remain as '1'.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Similar to previous examples, only non-border touching '1' objects become '8'.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:**
- This example reinforces the pattern, even with a larger grid size.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """Finds objects of '1' not touching the border and recolors them to '8'."""
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Find all objects of '1'
  non_border_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(toindices(obj), I))  # Filter for non-border objects
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), non_border_objs)  # Recolor to '8'
  O = I  # Initialize output grid
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint each object onto the output grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, True, False, False)` to find all connected objects formed by the digit '1'.
2. **Filter Non-Border Objects:** The `sfilter` function keeps only the objects that satisfy the condition of not being on the border (`bordering` function).
3. **Recolor Objects:**  We recolor the filtered objects to '8' using `recolor`.
4. **Paint Objects:** Finally, we iterate over the recolored objects and paint them onto a copy of the input grid (`I`) to generate the output (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """Iterates through the grid, recoloring '1's not on the border to '8'."""
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))  # Create an empty grid
  for i in range(1, h - 1):
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1:  # Check for '1'
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})  # Recolor to '8'
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))}) # Keep original color
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create Empty Grid:** An empty grid `O` is created with the same dimensions as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** The program iterates through the inner cells of the grid (excluding borders). If a cell contains '1', it's recolored to '8' and painted onto `O`. Other cell values are painted directly onto `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """Uses cellwise comparison to recolor non-border '1's to '8'."""
  O = cellwise(I, canvas(1, shape(I)), mostcolor(I))  # Create a mask for '1's
  O = replace(O, 1, 8) # Replace '1's with '8's
  O = cellwise(I, O, I)  # Combine with the original grid, using original values as fallback
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create Mask:** A mask grid is generated where cells containing '1' are kept, and others are replaced with the background color.
2. **Replace '1's:** All '1's in the mask are replaced with '8's.
3. **Combine with Original:** This mask is combined with the original grid using `cellwise`. If a cell in the mask is '8', that value is used; otherwise, the original grid value is retained.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """Identifies and recolors non-border cells of value '1' to '8'."""
  indices = asindices(I)
  border = outbox(indices)  # Find border indices
  non_border_indices = indices - border # Get non-border indices
  O = I
  for i, j in non_border_indices:
    if I[i][j] == 1:
      O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})  # Recolor '1' to '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find Non-Border Indices:** The code identifies border indices and then calculates non-border indices. 
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** It then iterates through the non-border indices, recoloring cells containing '1' to '8'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """Applies a lambda function to recolor non-border '1's to '8'."""
  O = apply(
      lambda row: tuple(
          8 if not bordering({(i, j)}, I) and v == 1 else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ),
      enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Lambda Function:** A lambda function is defined that takes a row and its index as input.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** For each cell in the row, it checks if it's a '1' and not on the border. If both conditions are met, it's recolored to '8'; otherwise, the original value is kept.
3. **Apply to Each Row:** The lambda function is applied to each row using `apply`, effectively recoloring the desired cells. 

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same outcome, using various DSL functions and logic.
