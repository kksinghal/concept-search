## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing all occurrences of a specific object within the input grid with a new object, but only if the original object is directly connected to another object of a different color. The new object takes the shape of the original object but with a different color.

**Input_0:**

* The object with color '1' is connected to the object with color '9'.
* All cells with value '1' are replaced with '8'.

**Input_1:**

* Two separate objects have color '1'. 
* The larger object is connected to the object with color '9'.
* Only the cells belonging to the larger object are replaced with '8'.

**Input_2:**

* Similar to Input_1, only the larger object with color '1' is connected to a different colored object.
* This connected object is replaced with the value '8'.

**Input_3:**

* Same logic as previous examples, highlighting that object size and shape don't affect the transformation.
* Only the connected '1' objects are replaced.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects excluding background
    x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)  # Filter objects with color '1'
    x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda obj: any(adjacent(obj, other_obj) and color(other_obj) != 1 for other_obj in x1))  # Filter objects connected to a different color
    x4 = merge(x3)  # Merge the selected objects into a single set of cells
    O = fill(I, 8, x4)  # Replace the selected cells with value '8'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Extract all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2.  Filter the objects to keep only those with the color '1'.
3.  Further filter the objects to select those directly adjacent to at least one other object of a different color.
4.  Merge the selected objects into a single set of cells.
5.  Replace the values of the merged cells with '8' in the input grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects
    x2 = [(obj, any(adjacent(obj, other_obj) and color(other_obj) != color(obj) for other_obj in x1)) for obj in x1 if color(obj) == 1]  # Pair each '1' object with a boolean indicating connection
    x3 = merge([obj for obj, connected in x2 if connected])  # Merge connected objects
    O = fill(I, 8, x3)  # Replace merged object cells with '8'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract all objects from the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the objects, focusing on those with color '1'. For each, check if it's adjacent to any other object of a different color and store the result as a boolean value alongside the object.
3.  Merge the objects that were marked as connected in the previous step.
4.  Fill the cells corresponding to the merged object with '8' in the input grid to obtain the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
    x2 = lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and any(adjacent(obj, other_obj) and color(other_obj) != 1 for other_obj in x1)  # Condition for object replacement
    x3 = mfilter(x1, x2)  # Filter and merge objects based on the condition
    O = fill(I, 8, x3)  # Fill cells of the merged object with '8'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Extract all objects from the grid.
2.  Define a lambda function to check if an object has color '1' and is adjacent to another object of a different color.
3.  Use `mfilter` to apply the condition to all objects and directly merge those that satisfy it.
4.  Fill the cells belonging to the merged object with '8' to get the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = [(obj, frozenset(color(other_obj) for other_obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if adjacent(obj, other_obj))) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)]  # Pair each object with the colors of its adjacent objects
    x2 = merge([obj for obj, adj_colors in x1 if 1 in adj_colors and len(adj_colors) > 1 and color(obj) == 1])  # Merge objects with color '1' connected to different colors
    O = fill(I, 8, x2)  # Replace merged object cells with '8'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains an object and a set of colors of its adjacent objects.
2.  Merge the objects with color '1' that have more than one color in their set of adjacent colors, indicating connection to other colors.
3.  Replace the cells corresponding to these merged objects with '8' in the input grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = lambda obj: fill(I, 8, obj) if color(obj) == 1 and any(adjacent(obj, other_obj) and color(other_obj) != 1 for other_obj in objects(I, T, F, T)) else I  # Define a lambda function to conditionally replace object with '8'
    O = apply(x1, objects(I, T, F, T))  # Apply the function to all objects in the grid
    return last(O)  # Return the final modified grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. Define a lambda function that checks if an object has color '1' and is adjacent to another object with a different color. If true, it replaces the object with '8', otherwise, it returns the original grid. 
2. Apply this function to all objects in the input grid using `apply`.
3.  Since `apply` returns a sequence of grids, we take the `last` one, which represents the final state after all modifications.


These five program versions illustrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL, demonstrating diverse logic and function combinations.
