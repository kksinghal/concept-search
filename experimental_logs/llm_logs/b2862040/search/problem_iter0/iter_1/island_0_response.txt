## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells adjacent to objects formed by the digit '1' and replacing them with the digit '8'. However, this replacement only occurs if the adjacent cell originally contains the background color (most common color) of the grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- Cells directly surrounding the '1' objects are replaced with '8', but only where the original value was '9' (the background color).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Same logic as above, with '8' replacing adjacent '9's around the '1' objects.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Similar to previous examples, '8' replaces background color '9' around the '1' objects.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**
- Consistent application of the transformation, replacing adjacent background cells with '8' around '1' objects.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = cfhbcgffgadgeecficeabifceiaajbei(I)
  O = replace(O, 8, mostcolor(I))
  O = solve_c1d99e64(O)
  O = replace(O, 2, 8)
  O = replace(O, mostcolor(I), 8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Utilize `cfhbcgffgadgeecficeabifceiaajbei(I)`:**  This identifies all neighbors of '1' and replaces them with '8'. 
2. **Restore Background:** Replace all newly placed '8's back to the original background color using `replace(O, 8, mostcolor(I))`.
3. **Identify Frontiers:** Employ `solve_c1d99e64(O)` to find and mark frontier cells (adjacent to the background) with '2'.
4. **Replace with Target:** Change the marker '2' to the desired '8' with `replace(O, 2, 8)`.
5. **Final Cleanup:** Replace any remaining background color cells that were part of the frontiers with '8' using `replace(O, mostcolor(I), 8)`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  neighbors = mapply(dneighbors, ones)
  valid_neighbors = sfilter(neighbors, lambda x: 0 <= x[0] < len(I) and 0 <= x[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, x) == bg)
  O = fill(I, 8, valid_neighbors)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Store Background Color:**  Store the background color for efficiency using `bg = mostcolor(I)`.
2. **Locate '1' Cells:** Find the indices of all '1' cells with `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`.
3. **Get Neighboring Cells:**  Get the indices of all cells directly adjacent to '1' cells with `neighbors = mapply(dneighbors, ones)`.
4. **Filter Valid Neighbors:** Keep only the neighboring cells that are within the grid bounds and contain the background color using `valid_neighbors = sfilter(...)`.
5. **Fill with Target Color:** Fill the valid neighboring cells with the target color '8' using `O = fill(I, 8, valid_neighbors)`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  neighbors = mapply(dneighbors, toindices(target_obj))
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  valid_neighbors = sfilter(neighbors, lambda x: 0 <= x[0] < len(I) and 0 <= x[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, x) == bg)
  O = fill(I, 8, valid_neighbors)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all connected objects in the grid using `objs = objects(I, True, False, False)`.
2. **Extract Target Object:** Extract the object formed by the digit '1' using `target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)`.
3. **Find Valid Neighbors:** Similar to Version 2, get neighboring cells, filter for valid ones within bounds and containing the background color.
4. **Fill with Target Color:** Fill the valid neighboring cells with '8'.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]:
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == mostcolor(I):
            O = fill(O, 8, {(ni, nj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Grid:** Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for '1':** If a cell contains '1', iterate through its four direct neighbors.
3. **Validate and Replace:** If a neighbor is within bounds and contains the background color, replace it with '8'.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  padded_grid = ((bg,)*(len(I[0])+2),) + tuple((bg,)+r+(bg,) for r in I) + ((bg,)*(len(I[0])+2),)
  O = tuple()
  for i in range(1, len(padded_grid)-1):
    row = tuple()
    for j in range(1, len(padded_grid[0])-1):
      if padded_grid[i][j] == 1:
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]:
          if padded_grid[i+di][j+dj] == bg:
            row += (8,)
          else: 
            row += (padded_grid[i][j],)
      else:
        row += (padded_grid[i][j],)
    O += (row,)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pad the Grid:** Create a padded version of the grid with the background color surrounding it to simplify boundary checks.
2. **Iterate and Replace:**  Similar to Version 4, iterate through the padded grid, checking for '1' and replacing adjacent background cells with '8'. The padding eliminates the need for explicit boundary checks. 

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to solving the transformation task using the provided DSL, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
