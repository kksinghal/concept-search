## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by the digit "1" and then replacing the cells immediately to the left of each "1" with the digit "8". 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- All cells to the left of the "1" objects are replaced with "8", except for the leftmost "1" in each row of the objects.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** 
- Same logic as in the previous example, but with a more complex arrangement of "1" objects.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** 
- Again, same logic applied. Note how even lone "1" cells have their left neighbors replaced.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:** 
- The transformation holds true for all instances, demonstrating its consistency.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find connected regions of '1's, excluding background
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  
  # Filter for regions containing only the digit '1'
  ones = colorfilter(x1, ONE)
  # Find the left neighbors of all '1' cells
  left_neighbors = mapply(lambda x: shift(x, LEFT), ones)
  # Remove left neighbors that are part of the '1' object
  filtered_neighbors = mfilter(left_neighbors, lambda x: not any((color(obj) == ONE for obj in objects(paint(I, x), T, F, T)) for i in toindices(x)))
  # Fill '8' at the filtered neighbor indices
  O = underfill(I, EIGHT, merge(filtered_neighbors))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' Objects:** Similar to previous attempts, we start by identifying objects formed by the digit "1" using `objects` and `colorfilter`.
2. **Find Left Neighbors:** We shift each "1" object one cell to the left using `shift(x, LEFT)`.
3. **Filter Out '1' Neighbors:** Using `mfilter`, we eliminate any shifted cells that are already part of a "1" object. This ensures we only target cells not belonging to the original objects.
4. **Fill with '8':** Finally, we use `underfill` to replace the filtered neighbor cells with the digit "8".

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get indices of all '1's 
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Shift indices one position left 
  shifted_indices = apply(lambda x: (x[0], x[1]-1), ones_indices)
  # Find the rightmost column index for each '1' region
  rightmost_cols = mapply(rightmost, colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE))
  # Filter for shifted indices not on the rightmost edge
  filtered_indices = sfilter(shifted_indices, lambda x: x[1] not in rightmost_cols)
  # Fill '8' at the filtered indices
  O = underfill(I, EIGHT, filtered_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Indices:** We directly get the indices of all '1' cells using `ofcolor`.
2. **Shift Left:** Similar to Version 1, we shift the indices one position left.
3. **Identify Right Edges:** We find the rightmost column of each '1' object using `rightmost`. 
4. **Filter Shifted Indices:** We keep only shifted indices that are not part of the rightmost column of a '1' object.
5. **Fill with '8':**  Again, `underfill` is used to replace the filtered indices with "8".

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find '1' objects
  ones = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)
  # Apply transformation to each object
  transformed_objects = mapply(lambda obj: {(v if j != rightmost(obj) else 8 if index(I, (i, j-1)) == ONE else v) for v, (i, j) in obj}, ones) 
  # Paint the transformed objects back onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, merge(transformed_objects))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Objects:** Identify "1" objects using `objects` and `colorfilter`.
2. **Transform Objects:**  We iterate through each object and modify its cells directly. If a cell is in the rightmost column and its left neighbor is "1", it's replaced with "8".
3. **Paint Back:** The transformed objects are painted back onto the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find connected regions, including background
  all_objects = objects(I, F, F, F)
  # Filter for '1' objects 
  ones = colorfilter(all_objects, ONE)
  # Get indices to the left of each '1' object, excluding background cells
  left_indices = mfilter(mapply(lambda obj: {(i, j-1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j > 0 and index(I, (i, j-1)) != mostcolor(I)}, ones), lambda x: x)
  # Fill the identified indices with '8'
  O = underfill(I, EIGHT, left_indices) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find All Objects:** This time, we find all connected regions, including background, using `objects(I, F, F, F)`.
2. **Isolate '1' Objects:** Filter for objects formed by "1" using `colorfilter`.
3. **Get Left Indices:** For each "1" object, get indices of cells to their left, excluding background cells and out-of-bounds indices.
4. **Fill with '8':** Use `underfill` to replace the identified cells with "8".


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Iterate through each cell in the grid
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      # If the current cell is '1' and not the leftmost '1' in its object:
      if I[i][j] == ONE and (j == 0 or I[i][j-1] != ONE): 
        O = fill(O, EIGHT, {(i, j-1)})  # Fill its left neighbor with '8'
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)}) # Otherwise, copy the original cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Grid:** This version directly iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check for '1' and Leftmost:** For each cell, it checks if it's "1" and not the leftmost "1" in its potential object.
3. **Fill Left Neighbor:** If the conditions are met, the cell's left neighbor is filled with "8".
4. **Copy Otherwise:** Otherwise, the original cell value is copied to the output grid.

These five versions showcase different approaches and logic to achieve the desired transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
