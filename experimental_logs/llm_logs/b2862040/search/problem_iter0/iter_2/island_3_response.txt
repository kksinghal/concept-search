## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces specific occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '8' in the output grid. The rule for replacement is:

- **Target '1's:** Only '1's that are part of an object directly connected (horizontally or vertically) to the border of the grid are targeted. 
- **Connected Object:**  A connected object is a group of '1's adjacent to each other (not diagonally).
- **Border Connection:** An object is considered connected to the border if at least one of its '1's is located in the first or last row, or the first or last column of the grid.

**Example Breakdown (Input_0 to Output_0):**

- The '1's in the top-left corner form an object connected to the top and left borders. All these '1's are replaced by '8's.
- The single '1' on the right edge is part of a border-connected object and is replaced. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1: Using `objects` and Filtering**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find connected objects, excluding background
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  # Filter objects that touch the border
  border_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  # Modify the grid by replacing '1's within border objects with '8's
  O = I
  for obj in border_objs:
    for value, (i, j) in obj:
      if value == 1:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies connected objects ('1's) within the input grid (`I`), excluding the background (most frequent digit).
2. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those that are adjacent to the grid border.
3. **Iteration and Replacement:** Iterates through each border object and its cells. If the cell value is '1', it's replaced with '8' in the output grid (`O`) using `fill`.

**Version 2:  Direct Border Check during Object Creation**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  # Function to check if a cell is on the grid border
  is_border = lambda i, j: i == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == 0 or j == w - 1 
  objs = set()
  occupied = set()
  unvisited = asindices(I)
  for loc in unvisited:
    if loc in occupied:
      continue
    # Start a new object only if the cell is '1' and on the border
    if I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 1 and is_border(loc[0], loc[1]):  
      obj = {(1, loc)}
      cands = {loc}
      while len(cands) > 0:
        neighborhood = set()
        for cand in cands:
          i, j = cand
          if I[i][j] == 1:
            obj.add((1, (i, j)))
            occupied.add((i, j))
            neighborhood |= {
                (i + di, j + dj) for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)] 
                if 0 <= i + di < h and 0 <= j + dj < w
            }
        cands = neighborhood - occupied
      objs.add(frozenset(obj))
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for value, (i, j) in obj:
      O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_border` Function:**  Defines a function to efficiently check if a cell's indices are on the grid border.
2. **Modified Object Creation:** The `objects` logic is adapted. A new object is initiated only if the starting cell is a '1' and is located on the border. 
3. **`fill` for Replacement:** Similar to Version 1, the identified border objects' cells are iterated through, and '1's are replaced with '8's in the output grid.

**Version 3:  Using `frontiers` and Filtering**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Get all frontiers
  ftiers = frontiers(I)
  # Filter for frontiers containing '1'
  target_ftiers = sfilter(ftiers, lambda f: any(v == 1 for v, _ in f))
  # Combine the target frontiers into a single patch
  target_patch = merge(target_ftiers)
  # Replace '1's within the combined patch with '8's
  O = fill(I, 8, toindices(sfilter(target_patch, lambda x: x[0] == 1))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`frontiers(I)`:**  Identifies all frontiers (continuous lines of the same color) in the grid.
2. **`sfilter` for '1'-containing Frontiers:** Filters the frontiers to keep only those that include at least one cell with the value '1'.
3. **`merge` and `fill`:** The '1'-containing frontiers are merged into a single patch.  '1's within this patch are then replaced with '8's in the output grid.

**Version 4: Exploiting Border Characteristics**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)] # Create a copy of the grid as a list of lists
  def flood_fill(i, j):
    if i < 0 or i >= h or j < 0 or j >= w or O[i][j] != 1:
      return
    O[i][j] = 8 
    flood_fill(i + 1, j)
    flood_fill(i - 1, j)
    flood_fill(i, j + 1)
    flood_fill(i, j - 1)

  # Iterate over the border cells of the grid
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if (i == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == 0 or j == w - 1) and O[i][j] == 1:
        flood_fill(i, j)

  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)  # Convert back to a tuple of tuples 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`flood_fill` Function:** Recursively explores connected regions of '1's starting from a given cell and replaces them with '8's.
2. **Border Iteration and Filling:** The code iterates through the grid's border cells. If a border cell contains a '1', it triggers the `flood_fill` function to replace the entire connected object containing that '1'.

**Version 5:  Combining `ofcolor` and Border Indices**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  border_indices = set()
  # Get indices of all border cells
  for i in range(h):
    border_indices.update({(i, 0), (i, w - 1)})
  for j in range(1, w - 1):
    border_indices.update({(0, j), (h - 1, j)})
  # Get indices of all '1's in the grid
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  # Find the intersection of border indices and '1' indices
  target_indices = border_indices & ones_indices
  # Replace the '1's at the target indices with '8's
  O = fill(I, 8, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Border Indices:**  Collects the indices of all cells located on the grid border.
2. **'1' Indices:**  Uses `ofcolor(I, 1)` to find the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
3. **Intersection:**  Calculates the intersection of the border indices and the '1' indices. This gives you the exact indices of '1's that are on the border.
4. **`fill` for Replacement:**  Uses the `fill` function to efficiently replace the '1's at the targeted indices with '8's in the output grid.
