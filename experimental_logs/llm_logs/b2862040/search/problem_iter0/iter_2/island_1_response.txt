## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the digit '1' with the digit '8' in all the input grids, except for the single occurrences of the digit '1'.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** All occurrences of '1', except the lone '1' on the right side, are replaced by '8'.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, all '1's are replaced by '8's, barring the isolated '1's at the bottom right.
* **Input_2:** The pattern repeats; all '1's become '8's, except for the individual '1's scattered throughout the grid.
* **Input_3:** Again, all occurrences of '1' are substituted with '8' except for the standalone '1's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find objects, excluding background and considering diagonals.
  x1 = objects(I, False, True, True) 
  # Isolate objects with only one cell.
  x2 = sizefilter(x1, 1) 
  # Combine the indices of single-cell objects.
  x3 = merge(apply(toindices, x2))
  # Replace '1's with '8's in the input grid, except for the single-cell objects.
  O = fill(replace(I, 1, 8), 1, x3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, False, True, True)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid, allowing for multi-valued objects, considering diagonal connections, and excluding the background color.
2. **Filter Single Cells:** `sizefilter(x1, 1)` extracts objects consisting of a single cell.
3. **Merge Indices:** `merge(apply(toindices, x2))` combines the indices of all single-cell objects into a single set.
4. **Selective Replacement:** `fill(replace(I, 1, 8), 1, x3)` first replaces all occurrences of '1' with '8' in the input grid. Then, it uses the combined indices of single-cell objects (`x3`) to fill those locations back with '1', effectively preserving them.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Partition the grid based on color, excluding background.
  x1 = fgpartition(I) 
  # Filter objects with size 1.
  x2 = sizefilter(x1, 1) 
  # Recolor all objects in the partition to '8'.
  x3 = apply(rbind(recolor, 8), x1) 
  # Combine and paint the recolored objects onto the input grid.
  x4 = paint(I, merge(x3)) 
  # Paint the single-cell objects back onto the grid with their original color ('1').
  O = paint(x4, merge(x2)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Grid:** `fgpartition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on color, excluding the background.
2. **Filter Single-Cell Objects:** `sizefilter(x1, 1)` extracts objects containing only one cell.
3. **Recolor Objects:** `apply(rbind(recolor, 8), x1)` recolors all objects in the partition to '8'.
4. **Paint Recolored Objects:** `paint(I, merge(x3))` paints the recolored objects back onto the original grid.
5. **Restore Single-Cell Objects:** `paint(x4, merge(x2))` paints the single-cell objects back onto the grid using their original color ('1'), effectively reversing the recoloring for these specific objects.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Directly replace '1's with '8's.
  x1 = replace(I, 1, 8)
  # Identify single-cell '1' objects, considering diagonals.
  x2 = objects(I, True, True, True)
  x3 = sizefilter(x2, 1)
  x4 = colorfilter(x3, 1)
  # Paint the single-cell '1' objects back onto the modified grid.
  O = paint(x1, merge(x4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace '1's:** `replace(I, 1, 8)` replaces all occurrences of '1' with '8' in the input grid.
2. **Identify Single-Cell '1' Objects:** `objects(I, True, True, True)` identifies single-cell objects with the color '1', considering diagonal connections and excluding the background.
3. **Paint Single-Cell Objects:** `paint(x1, merge(x4))` paints the single-cell '1' objects back onto the modified grid (`x1`), effectively restoring their original color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find the indices of all '1's in the grid.
  x1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
  # Identify single-cell '1' objects, considering diagonals and without background.
  x2 = objects(I, True, True, True)
  x3 = sizefilter(x2, 1)
  x4 = merge(apply(toindices, x3))
  # Find indices of '1's that are not part of single-cell objects.
  x5 = difference(x1, x4)
  # Replace '1's with '8's at the identified indices.
  O = fill(I, 8, x5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Indices:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Identify Single-Cell '1' Objects:** `objects(I, True, True, True)` identifies single-cell '1' objects, considering diagonal connections and excluding the background.
3. **Isolate Non-Single-Cell '1' Indices:** `difference(x1, x4)` identifies the indices of '1's that are not part of single-cell objects.
4. **Selective Replacement:** `fill(I, 8, x5)` replaces '1's with '8's only at the identified indices (`x5`), effectively preserving single-cell '1' objects.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Create a copy of the input grid.
  O = I
  # Iterate through each cell in the grid.
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      # If the cell contains '1' and it's not a single-cell object...
      if index(I, (i,j)) == 1 and size(objects(crop(I, (i,j), (1,1)), True, True, True)) != 1:
        # ...replace it with '8'.
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through every cell in the grid. For each cell containing '1', it checks if it belongs to a single-cell object using `size(objects(crop(I, (i,j), (1,1)), True, True, True)) != 1`.
2. **Selective Replacement:** If the cell is not part of a single-cell object, it's replaced with '8' using `O = fill(O, 8, {(i,j)})`. This directly modifies the copy of the input grid (`O`).

Each of these versions utilizes different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the given DSL.
