## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves finding all digits '1' in the input grid and replacing the cells to their left with the digit '8', except when the '1' is at the beginning of a row or if there is already an '8' to its left.

**Example:**

Input:
```
9 9 1 1 1
```

Output:
```
9 9 8 8 1
```

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all '1' objects
  ones = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)
  # Get indices to the left of each '1', excluding out-of-bounds indices
  left_indices = mfilter(mapply(lambda obj: {(i, j-1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j > 0}, ones), lambda x: x)
  # Fill '8' at the identified indices, only if the original cell is not '8'
  O = underfill(I, EIGHT, left_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:** We use `colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)` to locate all connected regions of '1's.
2. **Get left indices:** For each '1' object, we generate a set of indices directly to their left using `(i, j-1)`. We exclude indices where `j` is 0 (leftmost column) to avoid going out of bounds. `mfilter` removes any empty sets generated.
3. **Fill with '8':** Finally, we use `underfill` to replace cells at the identified `left_indices` with '8', but only if the cell doesn't already contain an '8'.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of all '1's
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Shift each index one position to the left
  shifted_indices = apply(lambda x: (x[0], x[1]-1), ones_indices)
  # Filter out shifted indices that are out of bounds (j < 0)
  valid_indices = sfilter(shifted_indices, lambda x: x[1] >= 0)
  # Fill '8' at the valid indices, only if the original cell is not '8'
  O = underfill(I, EIGHT, valid_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:** We use `ofcolor(I, ONE)` to obtain the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Shift left:**  We apply a lambda function to shift each index one position to the left using `(x[0], x[1]-1)`.
3. **Filter invalid indices:** We use `sfilter` to keep only the shifted indices that are within the grid's bounds (column index >= 0).
4. **Fill with '8':** Similar to version 1, we use `underfill` to replace cells at valid indices with '8', only if they are not already '8'.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Start with a copy of the input grid
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])  # Get grid dimensions
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      # If current cell is '1' and not at the beginning of the row
      if I[i][j] == ONE and j > 0:
        # If the cell to the left is not '8', replace it with '8'
        if O[i][j-1] != EIGHT:
          O = fill(O, EIGHT, {(i, j-1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through every cell in the grid. If a cell contains '1' and is not in the first column, it replaces the cell to its left with '8' if it's not already an '8'. This approach directly implements the transformation logic without relying on object detection or index manipulation functions.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all '1' objects 
  ones = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE) 
  # Create a set to store indices to be filled with '8'
  fill_indices = set()
  for obj in ones:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j > 0 and index(I, (i, j-1)) != EIGHT:
        fill_indices.add((i, j-1))
  # Fill the collected indices with '8'
  O = underfill(I, EIGHT, frozenset(fill_indices)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over each '1' object and collects the indices of cells to their left that are not already '8'. It then uses these collected indices to perform a single `underfill` operation.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all '1' cells
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Get left neighbors of '1' cells, excluding out-of-bounds indices
  left_neighbors = sfilter(apply(lambda x: (x[0], x[1]-1), ones), lambda x: x[1] >= 0)
  # Fill '8' at the left neighbors, only if they are not part of a '1' object and not already '8'
  O = I
  for i, j in left_neighbors:
    if index(I, (i, j)) != ONE and index(O, (i, j)) != EIGHT:
      O = fill(O, EIGHT, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version finds all '1' cell indices, shifts them left, filters out-of-bounds indices, and then iterates over the remaining left neighbor indices. It fills a cell with '8' only if it's not part of a '1' object and doesn't already contain an '8'. This approach avoids modifying the original grid until the final loop, potentially offering slight efficiency gains in certain scenarios.
