## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects (connected regions) of a specific color (1 in the input) and recoloring them to a different color (8 in the output). The background color (9) remains unchanged.

**Example:**

* **Input_0:** A single object formed by the digit '1'.
* **Output_0:** The object formed by '1' in the input is recolored to '8'.

This pattern holds true for all input-output pairs.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects (connected regions)
    x2 = colorfilter(x1, 1)    # Filter objects with color 1
    O = fill(I, 8, merge(x2)) # Recolor the filtered objects to 8
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all connected regions (objects) in the input grid `I`. `T, F, T` specifies objects are univalued, not diagonally connected, and without background.
2. **`colorfilter(x1, 1)`:** Filters the identified objects, keeping only those with color value 1.
3. **`merge(x2)`:** Merges the filtered objects into a single set of indices.
4. **`fill(I, 8, ...)`:** Fills the indices of the merged objects with the color value 8 in the input grid `I`, effectively recoloring the objects.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid as output.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = asobject(I)            # Convert the input grid to an object representation
    x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda x: x[0] == 1)  # Filter cells with color 1
    x3 = toindices(x2)          # Extract indices from the filtered cells
    O = fill(I, 8, x3)          # Fill the extracted indices with color 8
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asobject(I)`:**  Converts the input grid `I` into an object representation, treating each cell as a potential object.
2. **`sfilter(x1, lambda x: x[0] == 1)`:** Filters the object representation to keep only cells with color value 1.
3. **`toindices(x2)`:** Extracts the indices of the filtered cells.
4. **`fill(I, 8, x3)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with color 8 at the extracted indices, effectively recoloring the '1' cells to '8'.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid as output.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I                        # Initialize output as input
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])      # Get grid dimensions
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if I[i][j] == 1:     # If cell color is 1
                O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)}) # Recolor the cell to 8
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:** Retrieves the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid.
3. **`for i in range(h):` and `for j in range(w):`:**  Iterates through each cell of the grid using row index `i` and column index `j`.
4. **`if I[i][j] == 1:`:** Checks if the current cell in the input grid has color value 1.
5. **`O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})`:** If the cell color is 1, the `fill` function recolors that specific cell in the output grid `O` to color 8. 
6. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid as output.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = ofcolor(I, 1)         # Get indices of cells with color 1
    O = fill(I, 8, x1)         # Fill the identified indices with color 8
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  This function directly identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the color value 1. 
2. **`fill(I, 8, x1)`:** This function takes the input grid `I` and recolors the cells at the indices provided by `x1` (which are the indices of cells with color 1) to the color value 8.
3. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid as output. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 =  [(i,j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if I[i][j] == 1] # Get coordinates of 1s
    O = fill(I, 8, x1) # Replace 1s with 8s
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`[(i,j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if I[i][j] == 1]`**:  This list comprehension iterates over the grid and creates a list of coordinates `(i, j)` where the cell value is equal to 1.
2. **`fill(I, 8, x1)`**: This function takes the input grid `I`, the new color 8, and the list of coordinates `x1`. It then replaces the values at the specified coordinates in the input grid with the new color.
3. **`return O`**: Returns the modified grid as output.
