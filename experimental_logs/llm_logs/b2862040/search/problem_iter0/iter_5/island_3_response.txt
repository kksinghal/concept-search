## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently modifies the input grids based on the following rule:

**For each '1' in the input grid that is not directly connected to the border, replace it with an '8'.** 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 
* Several '1's exist within a larger '9' background. 
* The '1's directly touching the border remain unchanged. 
* All other '1's are replaced by '8's.

**Input_1:**
* Similar to Input_0, only the enclosed '1's are changed to '8's. 
* '1's on the border, even if part of a larger '1' structure, stay as '1's.

**Input_2 & Input_3:** 
* The pattern holds true for these larger, more complex inputs. 
* Only non-border-touching '1's are modified.

## Program Versions & Explanations:

Here are five distinct code versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_cells = outbox(asindices(I))  # Find all border cell indices
  inner_ones = frozenset((1, loc) for loc in asindices(I) if index(I, loc) == 1 and loc not in border_cells)
  return paint(I, inner_ones) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_cells = outbox(asindices(I))`**: This line identifies and stores the indices of all border cells in the grid `I`.
2. **`inner_ones = ...`**:  This line constructs a set called `inner_ones`. It iterates through each cell in the grid. If a cell's value is '1' and it's not a border cell, it's added to `inner_ones` as a tuple `(1, loc)`. 
3. **`return paint(I, inner_ones)`**: This line uses the `paint` function to modify the input grid `I`. It iterates through the `inner_ones` set and "paints" each location with the value '1', effectively keeping them unchanged.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  is_border = rbind(bordering, I)
  modified_grid = tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if index(I, (i, j)) == 1 and not is_border({(i, j)}) else I[i][j] 
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      ) 
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_border = rbind(bordering, I)`**: Creates a function `is_border` to check if a given cell is on the border of the grid.
2. **`modified_grid = ...`**:  Constructs a new grid `modified_grid` by iterating through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. **`8 if index(I, (i, j)) == 1 and not is_border({(i, j)}) else I[i][j]`**: For each cell, if the cell value is '1' and the cell is not on the border, it's replaced by '8'; otherwise, the original cell value is retained. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  not_border_one = lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I)
  inner_one_objects = mfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), not_border_one)
  return fill(I, 8, merge(map(toindices, inner_one_objects)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`not_border_one = ...`**: Defines a function to identify objects that are color '1' and not bordering the grid.
2. **`inner_one_objects = ...`**: Finds all connected components (objects) in the grid that are color '1' and not touching the border.
3. **`return fill(I, 8, merge(map(toindices, inner_one_objects)))`**: Fills all cells belonging to the identified `inner_one_objects` with the value '8'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True): 
    if color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I):
      I = fill(I, 8, obj)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):`**: Iterates through all connected components (objects) in the grid.
2. **`if color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I):`**: If the object is color '1' and doesn't touch the grid border.
3. **`I = fill(I, 8, obj)`**: The object's cells are filled with '8'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def change_inner_ones(grid, loc):
    if index(grid, loc) == 1 and not bordering({loc}, grid):
      return 8
    return index(grid, loc)
  return tuple(
      tuple(change_inner_ones(I, (i, j)) for j in range(len(I[0])))
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def change_inner_ones(grid, loc):`**: Defines a function to check if a cell is a non-border '1' and replace it with '8'.
2. **`return tuple(...)`**: Creates a new grid by applying `change_inner_ones` to each cell of the input grid. 

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to solving the given transformation task using the provided DSL.
