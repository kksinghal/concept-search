## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying connected components (objects) of a specific color (1) in the input grid and changing their color to another specific color (8) in the output grid.  

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
- The input grid contains a single object formed by the digit '1'.
- The output grid replaces all occurrences of the '1' object with '8'.

**Input_1:**
- The input grid has multiple objects formed by the digit '1'.
- The output grid replaces all instances of these '1' objects with '8'.

**Input_2:**
- Similar to Input_1, the input grid has multiple '1' objects.
- The output grid again replaces all occurrences of these objects with '8'.

**Input_3:**
- This input showcases a more complex arrangement of '1' objects.
- The output consistently replaces all instances of these objects with '8'.


## Code Generation & Explanation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_150deff5(I):
    x1 = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects formed by color 1, ignoring diagonals and background
    O = fill(I, 8, merge(apply(toindices, x1))) # Fill all extracted object indices with color 8
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies connected components of color 1 (True), ignoring diagonal connections (False), and excluding the background (True).
2. **Get Indices:** `apply(toindices, x1)` extracts the indices of all cells belonging to the extracted objects.
3. **Merge Indices:** `merge(...)` combines the indices from all objects into a single set.
4. **Fill with 8:** `fill(I, 8, ...)` fills the cells at the merged indices with the color 8.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_150deff5(I):
    obj = frozenset({(1, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == 1})  # Directly create the object representation of '1' cells
    O = paint(I, recolor(8, obj))  # Recolor the object to 8 and paint it onto the input grid
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Direct Object Creation:** The code directly constructs the object representation of all cells with value '1' using a set comprehension.
2. **Recolor and Paint:**  `recolor(8, obj)` changes the color of the object to '8'. `paint(I, ...)` then paints this recolored object onto a copy of the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_150deff5(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all cells with color 1
  O = fill(I, 8, indices)  # Fill those indices with color 8
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Find Indices:**  `ofcolor(I, 1)` directly retrieves the indices of all cells containing the color '1'.
2. **Fill with 8:** `fill(I, 8, indices)` fills the cells at the obtained indices with the color '8'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_150deff5(I):
    O = replace(I, 1, 8)  # Directly replace all occurrences of 1 with 8
    return O 
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Direct Replacement:**  This version utilizes the `replace` function to directly substitute all occurrences of the color '1' with the color '8' within the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_150deff5(I):
  x1 = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects of color 1, ignoring diagonals and background
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), x1)  # Recolor each extracted object to 8
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for obj in x2:
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint each recolored object onto the output grid
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Extract and Recolor:** It extracts objects of color 1 (similar to previous versions) and then uses `apply` to recolor each extracted object to 8.
2. **Iterative Painting:** It initializes the output grid as a copy of the input. Then, it iterates through the recolored objects and paints each one onto the output grid.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
