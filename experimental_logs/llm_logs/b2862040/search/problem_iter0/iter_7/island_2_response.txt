## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples involves identifying connected components (objects) of the digit '1' in the input grid and replacing them with the digit '8' in the output grid. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The input grid has a single connected component of '1's. The output grid replaces this component with '8's.

**Pair 1:** Similar to Pair 0, but with two connected components of '1's, both transformed into '8's in the output.

**Pair 2:**  Again, all connected components of '1's are replaced by '8's in the output.

**Pair 3:**  This example confirms the pattern - all connected components of '1's are replaced by '8's.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # extract connected components of 1s
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1) # filter objects with color 1
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), filtered_objs)  # recolor to 8
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj) # paint the recolor object back to the grid 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Extracts connected components (objects) from the input grid `I`. `True, False, True` arguments ensure it considers only directly adjacent cells (not diagonal) and excludes the background color.
2. **`colorfilter(objs, 1)`:**  Filters the extracted objects to keep only those with color value '1'.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), filtered_objs)`:** Applies the `recolor` function to each object in `filtered_objs`, changing their color to '8'.
4. **Loop and `paint`:** Iterates through the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid `I`, resulting in the output grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    indices = ofcolor(I, 1)  # get indices of all '1's
    O = fill(I, 8, indices) # fill those indices with '8'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Directly identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1' in the input grid.
2. **`fill(I, 8, indices)`:**  Efficiently fills all the identified indices with the value '8' in a copy of the input grid, generating the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})  # Fill with '8' if cell is '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** This version iterates directly through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Conditional Fill:**  If a cell's value is '1', it uses `fill` to replace that specific cell with '8' in the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(tuple(8 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:** This version utilizes a concise list comprehension to achieve the transformation in a single line. It iterates through each row and cell, replacing '1's with '8's while keeping other values unchanged.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = asobject(I) # convert grid to object
  filtered_obj = sfilter(obj, lambda x: x[0] == 1) # filter cells with color 1
  recolored_obj = apply(lambda x: (8, x[1]), filtered_obj) # recolor cells to 8
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolored_obj) # paint on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the entire input grid into a single object, treating each cell as a (value, index) pair.
2. **`sfilter(obj, lambda x: x[0] == 1)`:** Filters this object to keep only cells with color value '1'.
3. **`apply(lambda x: (8, x[1]), filtered_obj)`:**  Changes the color of the filtered cells to '8' within the object.
4. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolored_obj)`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input and then paints the recolored object onto it, generating the final output.


Each of these program versions provides a distinct approach to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions, offering diverse solutions to the problem.
