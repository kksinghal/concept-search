## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify specific objects within the input grid and change their color to '8' while preserving the rest of the grid. The objects targeted for recoloring are defined by the following rules:

1. **Univalued Objects:** Each object consists of cells with the same digit value.
2. **Non-Bordering:** Objects must not touch the borders of the grid. 
3. **Specific Value (Optional):** Some transformations may target objects with a specific value (e.g., '1').

**Examples:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** All '1' objects not touching the border are recolored to '8'.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Same as above.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** Same as above.
* **Input_3 to Output_3:** Same as above.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Find univalued, non-background objects
  inner_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)) # Filter for non-bordering objects
  target_objs = sfilter(inner_objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1) # Filter for objects with color '1'
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, merge(target_objs)))  # Recolor and paint to the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds all univalued objects excluding the background.
2. **Filter Non-Bordering:** `sfilter` with `bordering` keeps objects not touching the grid border.
3. **Filter Target Value:**  Another `sfilter` with `color(obj) == 1` isolates objects with value '1'.
4. **Recolor and Paint:** `recolor(8, merge(target_objs))` changes the color of target objects to '8', `merge` combines them, and `paint` applies them to the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  inner_indices = sfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: not bordering({loc}, I)) # Find non-bordering indices
  target_indices = sfilter(inner_indices, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1)  # Find non-bordering '1' indices
  O = fill(I, 8, target_indices) # Fill '8' at target indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Non-Bordering Indices:** `sfilter` with `bordering` filters indices on the grid border.
2. **Find Target Indices:** Another `sfilter` finds indices of non-bordering cells with value '1'.
3. **Fill Target Cells:** `fill` replaces the values at the target indices with '8'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    canvas_8 = canvas(8, shape(I)) # Create canvas of '8's 
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Find univalued, non-background objects
    border_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I)) # Find bordering objects
    O = paint(canvas_8, difference(asobject(I), merge(border_objs))) # Paint non-bordering cells from input to canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create '8' Canvas:**  `canvas(8, shape(I))` creates a grid of the same size as the input filled with '8'.
2. **Find Bordering Objects:** Similar to previous versions, it identifies objects touching the border.
3. **Paint Non-Bordering Cells:** It calculates the difference between all cells in the input and the bordering objects, effectively selecting non-bordering cells. These cells, with their original values, are then painted onto the '8' canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = apply(
      lambda row: tuple(
          8 if not bordering({(i, j)}, I) and v == 1 else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ),
      enumerate(I)
  )
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Modify:** This version directly iterates through the rows and cells of the input grid using nested loops implied by `apply` and a list comprehension. 
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** For each cell, it checks if it's non-bordering (`not bordering`) and has a value of '1'. If both conditions are true, it recolors the cell to '8'; otherwise, it retains the original value. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  is_target = lambda loc: not bordering({loc}, I) and index(I, loc) == 1 # Function to check for target cell
  modified_indices = sfilter(asindices(I), is_target) # Find all target cell indices
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, toobject(modified_indices, I))) # Recolor and paint target cells 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Target Cell Function:** `is_target` checks if a location is non-bordering and has the value '1'.
2. **Find Target Indices:** `sfilter` uses `is_target` to identify indices of target cells.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** `toobject` converts the indices back to an object using values from the input grid. `recolor` changes the object color to '8', and finally, `paint` applies it to the input.
