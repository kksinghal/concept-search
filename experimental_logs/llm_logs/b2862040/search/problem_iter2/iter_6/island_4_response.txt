## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be extending all connected components of the digit '1' to the left, filling the space with the digit '8' until they reach another object or the edge of the grid. 

Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The '1' object at the top middle extends leftward with '8's, stopping before the rightmost '1' object. Similarly, the '1' object at the bottom left does the same, stopping before the '1' object above it.

**Pair 1:** This example demonstrates that the extension occurs for each separate '1' object. Notice how the two separate '1' objects in the top left both extend leftward with '8's independently. 

**Pair 2:** This example reaffirms the behavior observed in the previous examples.

**Pair 3:** This example further emphasizes the independent extension of each '1' object, even when they are close together.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_left(obj):
    if color(obj) != 1:
      return frozenset()
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    return frozenset((8, (i, k)) for i, j in toindices(obj) for k in range(min_j - 1, -1, -1) if index(I, (i, k)) == 9)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_left, objects(I, True, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_left(obj)` Function:** 
    - Takes an object `obj` as input.
    - If the object's color is not '1', it returns an empty set (no change).
    - Finds the leftmost column index (`min_j`) of the object.
    - Iterates through each cell `(i, j)` in the object and for each cell, iterates towards the left edge of the grid from `min_j - 1` to 0. 
    - If the cell at `(i, k)` contains '9' (background), it adds a new cell `(8, (i, k))` to the output set, effectively extending the object leftward with '8's.

2. **Main Program:**
    - Extracts all objects from the input grid `I` using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
    - Applies the `extend_left` function to each object using `apply`.
    - Merges the results of the `extend_left` function for all objects using `merge`.
    - Paints the merged set of new cells onto the input grid `I` using `paint`, resulting in the final output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  new_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, -1, -1):
          if index(I, (i, j)) == 9:
            new_cells.add((8, (i, j)))
          else:
            break
  return paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses a similar logic to Version 1 but iterates directly over the objects and cells.
- It creates a set `new_cells` to store the coordinates and color of the cells to be painted.
- For each object colored '1', it iterates over its rows and then each column to the left, painting cells with '8' until it encounters a non-'9' cell.
- Finally, it paints the `new_cells` onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_left(i, j):
    if index(I, (i, j)) != 9:
      return frozenset()
    return frozenset((8, (i, k)) for k in range(j, -1, -1) if index(I, (i, k)) == 9)
  one_indices = toindices(objects(I, True, False, True)[0])
  return paint(I, merge(apply(fill_left, *zip(*one_indices))))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses a `fill_left` function that takes a single cell coordinate as input and fills to the left.
- It first extracts the indices of all cells belonging to the '1' objects.
- Then, it applies `fill_left` to each cell coordinate, effectively checking and filling from each '1' cell individually.
- This version might be slightly less efficient as it checks and potentially fills the same area multiple times.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  def fill_row(i):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        return tuple(8 if v == 9 else v for v in I[i][:j]) + I[i][j:]
    return I[i]
  return tuple(fill_row(i) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version takes a row-by-row approach to the transformation.
- The `fill_row` function processes each row independently. 
- It iterates through the row, and if it finds a '1', it replaces all preceding '9's with '8's.
- The main program applies `fill_row` to each row and reconstructs the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_obj(obj):
    if color(obj) != 1:
      return frozenset()
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    extension = frozenset((i, k) for i, j in toindices(obj) for k in range(min_j - 1, -1, -1) if index(I, (i, k)) == 9)
    return recolor(8, extension)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_obj, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to Version 1 but uses `recolor` to directly paint the extension with '8's after finding the indices for the extension.
- This demonstrates a slightly different approach using existing DSL functions in a more combined way.

These five code versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation. Please note that these are just a few examples, and many other valid solutions might exist.
