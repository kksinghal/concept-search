## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying connected components (objects) in the input grid, where connectivity is defined by shared edges and having the same value. Then, the transformation shifts the left edge of each object one cell to the left and recolors it to the value 8.

**Let's analyze each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** The single object's left edge is shifted left, expanding the object and coloring the new cells with 8.
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:** The left edge of both objects is shifted, extending them to the left and introducing new 8-valued cells.
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:**  Similar to the previous examples, the left edge of each object is moved leftward, resulting in an expanded object with 8s at the new edge.
* **Input_3 -> Output_3:** The transformation is applied consistently â€“ each object's left edge is moved left and colored with 8. 


## Code Generation & Explanation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(recolor(EIGHT, shift(frozenset((i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)), (-1, 0))) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies connected components (objects) in the input grid `I`. Objects are defined by shared edges, same value, and excluding the background.
2. **`for obj in objects(...)`:** Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)`:** Generates the indices representing the left edge of the current object.
4. **`frozenset(...)`:** Converts the generated indices into a frozenset (a Patch).
5. **`shift(..., (-1, 0))`:** Shifts the left edge one cell to the left.
6. **`recolor(EIGHT, ...)`:** Recolors the shifted edge to have the value 8.
7. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the shifted and recolored edges of all objects into a single set.
8. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged edges onto the input grid `I`, effectively shifting and recoloring the left edges of all objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    left_edge = frozenset((i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))
    new_objs = combine(new_objs, recolor(EIGHT, shift(left_edge, (-1, 0))))
  return paint(I, new_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a loop and the `combine` function for a more explicit approach. The logic is the same as in version 1, but it iteratively builds the set of shifted and recolored edges before painting them onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mapply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, shift(frozenset((i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)), (-1, 0))), objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `mapply` function to apply the shifting and recoloring operation to each object in a more compact form. It avoids explicit loops by leveraging functional programming constructs.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, shift(frozenset((i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)), (-1, 0))), objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version replaces `mapply` with a combination of `apply` and `merge` to achieve the same outcome. While slightly more verbose, it demonstrates a different combination of DSL functions.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    left_edge = frozenset((i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))
    return recolor(EIGHT, shift(left_edge, (-1, 0)))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(process_object, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `process_object` to encapsulate the logic of shifting and recoloring an object's left edge. This improves code readability and modularity while demonstrating the use of nested functions within the DSL.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. They vary in their use of loops, functional programming constructs, and helper functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
