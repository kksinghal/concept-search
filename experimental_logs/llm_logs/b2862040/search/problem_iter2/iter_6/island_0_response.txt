## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected areas of the same color excluding the background) within the input grid and drawing a border around them using the color '8'. The border extends one cell outwards in the downward and rightward directions.

**Example:**

Input:
```
9 9 1
9 1 9 
1 9 9
```

Output:
```
9 9 1 9
9 1 9 8
1 9 9 8
9 8 8 8 
```

Here, the object consisting of '1's is identified, and a border of '8's is drawn around it, extending one cell down and right.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT), objs, objs)
  shifted_down = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), DOWN), objs, objs)
  border_indices = merge((shifted_right, shifted_down))
  return underpaint(I, recolor(8, border_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`. 
2. **Shift Indices:** `shifted_right` and `shifted_down` store the indices of each object after being shifted one cell to the right and down respectively. This uses `mapply` to apply the `shift` function to each object in `objs` along with `objs` itself as the second argument for `mapply`.
3. **Merge Indices:** `border_indices` merges the shifted indices to get all indices where the border should be drawn.
4. **Paint Border:** `underpaint(I, recolor(8, border_indices))` paints the border by first recoloring the `border_indices` to '8' and then painting them onto the input grid `I`, only affecting background cells.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  borders = mpapply(lambda obj: combine(shift(toindices(obj), DOWN), shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT)), objs, objs)
  return paint(I, recolor(8, borders))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects.
2. **Generate Borders:** `borders` calculates the border indices for each object by combining the indices shifted right and down using `combine`, and then merges all border indices using `mpapply`.
3. **Paint Borders:** `paint(I, recolor(8, borders))` paints the borders by recoloring `borders` to '8' and painting them onto the input grid `I`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def add_border(obj):
    return combine(shift(toindices(obj), DOWN), shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT))
  borders = mapply(add_border, objects(I, T, F, T), objects(I, T, F, T))
  return underpaint(I, recolor(8, borders))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `add_border`:** This function takes an object and returns the indices of its border by combining the indices shifted down and right.
2. **Calculate Borders:**  `borders` applies `add_border` to each object in the input and merges the resulting border indices using `mapply`.
3. **Paint Borders:** Similar to previous versions, this line paints the borders onto the input grid using `underpaint` and `recolor`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_border(obj):
    return toindices(combine(shift(obj, DOWN), shift(obj, RIGHT)))
  return underpaint(I, recolor(8, merge(apply(get_border, objects(I, T, F, T)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `get_border`:** This function takes an object and returns the indices of its border. It first shifts the object down and right, combines the shifted versions, and then extracts the indices.
2. **Apply and Merge:** This line applies `get_border` to all objects in the input using `apply` and merges the resulting border indices using `merge`.
3. **Paint Border:** This line is similar to previous versions, painting the calculated borders onto the input grid. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def border_indices(obj):
    return combine(shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT), shift(toindices(obj), DOWN))
  return paint(I, recolor(8, merge(apply(border_indices, objects(I, T, F, T))))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `border_indices`:** This function takes an object and returns the indices for its border by combining the right-shifted and down-shifted indices. 
2. **Calculate and Paint:** This line identifies objects, applies `border_indices` to each, merges the results, recolors them to '8', and finally paints them onto the input grid.
