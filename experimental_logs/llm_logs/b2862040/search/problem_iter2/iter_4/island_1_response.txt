## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying foreground objects within the input grid and extending them to the right by one cell with the color 8, but only if the rightward cell is initially the background color. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The single '1' object is extended rightward with '8's because the cells to the right are filled with the background color ('9').

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous example, all '1' objects are extended rightward.  Note how the extension happens even when the objects are on different rows.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  The '1' objects are extended rightward. Importantly, the rightmost '1' object does not extend beyond the grid boundary.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**  This example emphasizes that only '1' objects are extended. The lone '1' at the bottom right extends both horizontally and diagonally because the neighboring cells are background.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    extended_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        extended_obj = set(obj)
        for _, (i, j) in obj:
            if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg:
                extended_obj.add((8, (i, j + 1)))
        extended_objs.add(frozenset(extended_obj))
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), extended_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background & Objects:**  `bg = mostcolor(I)` determines the background color. `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts foreground objects. 
2. **Extend Objects:** The code iterates over each object (`obj` in `objs`). For every cell in the object, it checks if a rightward extension is possible (within grid bounds and background color). If so, a new cell with value 8 is added to the `extended_obj`.
3. **Paint Extended Objects:** A new canvas (`canvas(bg, shape(I))`) is created, and the extended objects are painted onto it.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  extended_objs = frozenset(
      frozenset(
          (8, (i, j + 1)) if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg else (c, (i, j))
          for c, (i, j) in obj
      ) for obj in objs
  )
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), extended_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background & Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Extend Objects:** This version uses nested set comprehensions for a more compact expression. It iterates over objects and their cells, adding a rightward extension with color 8 if conditions are met.
3. **Paint Extended Objects:** Identical to version 1.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    def extend_right(obj):
        return toobject(combine(toindices(obj), {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg}), I)
    extended_objs = frozenset(map(extend_right, objs))
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), recolor(8, extended_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background & Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Extend Objects:** This version defines a helper function `extend_right` to handle object extension. It combines the original object indices with potential rightward extension indices, then uses `toobject` to create the extended object. 
3. **Paint Extended Objects:** Similar to previous versions, but it uses `recolor` to change the color of the extended objects to 8.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != bg and j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg:
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:**  Finds the background color.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** This version directly iterates through the grid, cell by cell. If a cell is not background and has a rightward background neighbor, it paints an '8' onto the output grid at that neighbor's location.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  extension_indices = frozenset(
      (i, j + 1)
      for obj in objs
      for _, (i, j) in obj
      if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg
  )
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), recolor(8, extension_indices))
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background & Objects:** Same as before.
2. **Find Extension Indices:** This version first identifies all valid extension indices using a set comprehension. 
3. **Paint Extensions:** It then paints the color 8 directly onto those indices on a new canvas. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to solving the given transformation using the provided DSL, ranging from object-centric manipulations to direct grid iteration. Each version leverages different function combinations and logic flow, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
