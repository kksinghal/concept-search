## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background) in the input grid and extending them to the right. The extension is done by adding a column of '8's to the right of each object, effectively doubling its width. The height of the extended object remains the same. The background color remains unchanged during this transformation.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  extended_objs = frozenset(hconcat(crop(I, ulcorner(obj), shape(obj)), canvas(8, (height(obj), width(obj)))) for obj in objs)
  painted_grid = I
  for obj in extended_objs:
    painted_grid = underpaint(painted_grid, shift(asobject(obj), (ulcorner(objs.pop())[0], width(I))))
  return painted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:** Determine the background color (`bg`) and extract all objects (`objs`) from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Extend each object:** Iterate through each object (`obj`) in `objs`, and perform the following:
    -  Extract the object as a subgrid.
    -  Create a new grid of the same height and width filled with '8's.
    -  Horizontally concatenate the object grid and the '8's grid to create the extended object.
3. **Paint extended objects onto a new grid:** 
    - Initialize a new grid (`painted_grid`) as a copy of the input grid.
    -  For each extended object:
        -  Convert the extended object grid to an object representation.
        -  Shift the object to the right by the width of the original input grid.
        -  Paint the shifted object onto `painted_grid`, only overwriting background cells. 
4. **Return the transformed grid:** The final `painted_grid` represents the output with extended objects.

**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, (height(I), 2 * width(I)))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
      if I[i][j] != bg:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 8, {(i, j + width(I))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:** Create a new grid (`new_grid`) with double the width of the input grid (`I`) and filled with the background color (`bg`).
2. **Copy input and extend with '8's:** Iterate through each cell in the input grid:
    - Copy the value from the input grid to the corresponding cell in `new_grid`.
    - If the cell is not background, fill the cell to its right (offset by the width of the input grid) in `new_grid` with '8'. 
3. **Return the transformed grid:** The final `new_grid` represents the output with extended objects.

**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  extended_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    extended_grid = hconcat(extended_grid, canvas(8 if obj else bg, shape(obj)))
  return extended_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:** Determine the background color (`bg`) and extract all objects (`objs`) from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Extend the grid object by object:** 
    - Initialize a new grid (`extended_grid`) as a copy of the input grid.
    - Iterate through each object (`obj`) in `objs`:
        - Create a new grid with the same shape as the object, filled with '8's if the object exists, otherwise filled with the background color.
        -  Horizontally concatenate the `extended_grid` and the newly created grid.
3. **Return the transformed grid:** The final `extended_grid` represents the output with extended objects. 

**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      I[i][j] if j < width(I) else (8 if any(I[i][k] != bg for k in range(width(I))) else bg)
      for j in range(2 * width(I))
    )
    for i in range(height(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:** Determine the background color (`bg`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Construct the output grid:** Create a new grid with double the width of the input grid using nested loops and conditional logic within the loop:
    - For each cell in the new grid:
        - If the cell's column index is within the original grid's width, copy the value from the corresponding cell in the input grid. 
        - Otherwise, check if any cell in the same row of the input grid is not a background color. If true, fill the cell with '8'; otherwise, fill it with the background color.
3. **Return the transformed grid:** The constructed grid represents the output with extended objects.

**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return tuple(
    tuple(v if j < width(I) else (8 if any(c != bg for c in r) else bg) for j, v in enumerate(r))
    for i, r in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:** Determine the background color (`bg`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Construct the output grid:** Use nested loops and conditional logic within the loop to create the new grid:
    - Iterate through each row (`r`) and its index (`i`) in the input grid.
    - For each value (`v`) and its index (`j`) within the row:
        - If `j` is less than the original grid's width, keep the original value (`v`).
        - Otherwise, check if any cell (`c`) in the current row (`r`) is not the background color. If true, fill the cell with '8'; otherwise, fill it with the background color.
3. **Return the transformed grid:** The constructed grid represents the output with extended objects.
