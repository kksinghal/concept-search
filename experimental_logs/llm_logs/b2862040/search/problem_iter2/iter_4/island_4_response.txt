## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be extending the left side of objects with color 1 (target_color) horizontally to the left until it hits a non-background (color 9) and non-target_color cell. The extended area is filled with color 8 (extension_color). 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0 & Output_0:** The three objects formed by color 1 are extended leftwards. The top and bottom objects are blocked by color 1 itself, while the middle object extends until the left border.

* **Input_1 & Output_1:**  Similar to the previous example, the objects are extended leftwards. Notice how the extension on the bottom row goes past the object above it, highlighting that the extension isn't bound by other objects of the same color.

* **Input_2 & Output_2:**  The extension happens for all objects, even if they are partially out of bounds. The extension continues until it hits a non-background and non-target color.

* **Input_3 & Output_3:** The extension happens for objects even if they touch the border. This example emphasizes that the extension isn't stopped by the grid boundary.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    target_color = 1
    extension_color = 8
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Identify objects
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == target_color: # Target color objects
            min_j = leftmost(obj) # Leftmost column
            for i, j in toindices(obj):
                for k in range(j - 1, -1, -1): # Extend leftwards
                    if index(I, (i, k)) not in (9, target_color):
                        break
                    I = fill(I, extension_color, {(i, k)}) # Fill extension
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Set `target_color` and `extension_color`.
2. **Object Identification:** Identify objects in the grid using `objects`.
3. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through each object (`obj`) in the identified objects.
4. **Target Color Check:** If the object's color matches `target_color`, proceed.
5. **Leftmost Column:** Determine the leftmost column (`min_j`) of the object.
6. **Cell Iteration:** Iterate through each cell (`i`, `j`) within the object.
7. **Leftward Extension:**  For each cell, extend leftwards (`k`) until encountering a non-background and non-target color cell or the grid boundary.
8. **Fill Extension:** Fill the extended cells with `extension_color`.
9. **Return Modified Grid:** Return the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge({recolor(8, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j-1, -1, -1) if index(I, (i, k)) == 9)) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 1 for i, j in toindices(obj)}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more functional approach with nested comprehensions for conciseness. 
1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies objects using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Filter by Color:** It filters objects for those with `color(obj) == 1`.
3. **Iterate through Cells:** For each cell `(i, j)` in the filtered objects, it extends leftwards.
4. **Extend and Recolor:**  It generates a set of indices to extend leftwards (`(i, k)`) and recolors them to 8 using `recolor(8, ...)`.
5. **Merge and Paint:** The extended indices are merged using `merge` and painted onto the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1: # If cell color is target_color
        k = j - 1 # Start from the left adjacent cell
        while k >= 0 and I[i][k] == 9: # Extend left while background
          I = fill(I, 8, {(i, k)}) # Fill with extension color
          k -= 1 # Move to the next left cell
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates directly over the grid cells instead of using the `objects` function. This might be slightly less efficient for sparse grids but is simpler to understand.

1. **Grid Iteration:**  Iterate through each cell (`i`, `j`) of the grid.
2. **Target Color Check:** If the cell's value is the `target_color`, proceed.
3. **Leftward Extension:** Extend leftwards (`k`) from the current cell's position, filling with `extension_color` as long as the encountered cells are background color.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Finally, return the modified grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_obj(obj):
    if color(obj) != 1:
      return frozenset()
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    return frozenset((8, (i, k)) for i, j in toindices(obj) for k in range(j - 1, min_j - 1, -1) if index(I, (i, k)) == 9)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_obj, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a helper function `extend_obj` to calculate the extension for each object.  
1. **Object Identification:** It identifies objects in the grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Apply Extension:** It applies the `extend_obj` function to each object.
3. **Merge and Paint:** The extensions are merged and painted onto the original grid using `merge` and `paint`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def left_fill(grid, i, j):
    k = j - 1
    while k >= 0 and grid[i][k] == 9:
      grid = fill(grid, 8, {(i, k)})
      k -= 1
    return grid
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        I = left_fill(I, i, j)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `left_fill` for clarity, which handles the leftward extension logic. 
1. **Grid Iteration:** It iterates over the grid cells.
2. **Target Color Check:** If a cell has the `target_color`, it calls `left_fill`.
3. **Leftward Fill:** `left_fill` performs the extension and returns the modified grid.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** The final modified grid is returned.

These are five distinct versions of the program, each utilizing different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation. This demonstrates the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving this task.
