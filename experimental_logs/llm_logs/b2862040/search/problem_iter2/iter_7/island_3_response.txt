## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve the following steps:

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects (connected regions) of the digit "1" in the input grid.
2. **Expand Grid:** Expand the grid's dimensions to accommodate the transformed output. 
3. **Draw Outboxes:** For each identified object, draw an "outbox" around it. This outbox is essentially the perimeter of the bounding box surrounding the object, shifted one unit to the right and one unit down. The outbox is drawn using the digit "8".

**Specific Observations:**

* **Background Preservation:** The background color (digit "9") from the input grid is preserved in the output grid.
* **Object Expansion:** The outbox effectively creates an expansion effect around each object.
* **Overlapping Handling:** In cases where outboxes overlap, the overlapping cells retain the "8" value.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify the background color
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects of '1'
  O = canvas(bg, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))  # Create an expanded canvas
  O = fill(O, I, {(i + 1, j + 1) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I))})  # Place the input grid onto the expanded canvas
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, 8, shift(outbox(toindices(obj)), (1, 1)))  # Draw the shifted outbox for each object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation and Filling:**  Creates an expanded canvas (`O`) filled with the background color (`bg`) and then copies the input grid (`I`) onto it with a one-cell offset.
2. **Object Iteration and Outbox Drawing:**  Iterates over the extracted objects (`objs`) and for each object:
   - Calculates the `outbox`.
   - `shift`s the outbox one unit down and one unit right.
   - Uses `underfill` to draw the shifted outbox on the canvas (`O`) with the digit "8". 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    max_i = max([lowermost(obj) for obj in objs] + [0])  # Find the lowest row index
    max_j = max([rightmost(obj) for obj in objs] + [0])  # Find the rightmost column index
    O = canvas(bg, (max(height(I), max_i + 2), max(width(I), max_j + 2)))  # Dynamically size the canvas
    O = fill(O, I, asindices(I))  # Fill with the input grid
    for obj in objs:
        O = underfill(O, 8, shift(outbox(toindices(obj)), (1, 1))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dynamic Canvas Sizing:** Determines the required canvas size dynamically by finding the maximum row and column indices of objects plus two. This ensures the canvas is just large enough to fit the expanded objects.
2. **Direct Filling:** Uses `asindices` and `fill` to directly copy the input grid onto the appropriately sized canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    h, w = height(I), width(I)
    O = canvas(bg, (h + 2, w + 2))
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if I[i][j] != bg: 
                O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i + 1, j + 1)})  # Place non-background cells individually
    for obj in objs:
        O = underfill(O, 8, shift(outbox(toindices(obj)), (1, 1)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Selective Filling:** Instead of copying the entire input grid, this version iterates through its cells and only copies non-background cells to the canvas.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, outbox(toindices(obj))), (1, 1))) # Recolor and then shift the outbox
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1)))  # Finally, paint the original objects on top
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Outbox First, Objects Later:** This version prioritizes drawing the outboxes first. It recolors the outboxes to "8" and then shifts and paints them.
2. **Object Overlay:** Finally, it paints the original objects from the input grid on top of the outboxes, ensuring they are visible.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = canvas(bg, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != bg:
                O = fill(O, val, {(i + 1, j + 1)}) # Place non-background cells 
    for obj in objs:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1)]: # Define relative outbox offsets
            O = underfill(O, 8, shift(obj, (di, dj)))  # Draw the outbox by shifting the object itself
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object-Centric Outbox Drawing:** Instead of calculating the outbox indices separately, this version iterates over pre-defined relative offsets from the object's cells and directly uses `underfill` to draw the outbox. This approach simplifies the code and potentially improves efficiency.
