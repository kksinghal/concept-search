## Transformation Analysis:

**General Pattern:** The transformation involves identifying the object formed by the digit '1' (excluding background '9's) and then filling the space to the left of each '1' within the object with the digit '8'.

**Input 0:** 
- The object formed by '1' is a small plus sign.
- The space to the left of each '1' within the plus sign is filled with '8'.

**Input 1:** 
- The object formed by '1' is more spread out and touches the right edge.
- The filling with '8' occurs to the left of each '1' within this object, extending to the left edge for '1's in the same row.

**Input 2:** 
- The object is more complex and touches both left and bottom edges.
- The '8' filling is consistent, extending leftwards within the object boundaries.

**Input 3:** 
-  This example showcases the importance of object boundaries. 
-  The '8' filling respects the object shape, only affecting cells within the object formed by '1's.


## Code Generation:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Identify the object formed by '1's (excluding background)
    obj = objects(I, True, False, True)[0]
    
    # Get indices of '1's within the object
    one_indices = frozenset(loc for v, loc in obj if v == 1) 

    # Function to fill leftwards within the object
    def fill_left(i, j):
        # Only fill if current cell is within object and is a '9'
        if (1, (i, j)) in obj and index(I, (i, j)) == 9:
            return frozenset((8, (i, k)) for k in range(j-1, -1, -1) if (1, (i, k)) in obj)
        else:
            return frozenset()

    # Apply fill_left to all '1' indices and merge the results
    filled_cells = merge(apply(lambda loc: fill_left(*loc), one_indices))
    
    # Paint the filled cells onto the original grid
    return paint(I, filled_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object:** `objects(I, True, False, True)[0]` extracts the object formed by '1's.
2. **Find '1' Indices:** `one_indices` stores the locations of all '1's within the object.
3. **Fill Leftwards:** `fill_left(i, j)` handles the core logic:
    - It checks if the current cell (i, j) is both part of the object and contains a '9'.
    - If true, it fills all cells to the left with '8' until reaching the object boundary.
4. **Apply and Merge:** `apply(lambda loc: fill_left(*loc), one_indices)` applies `fill_left` to each '1' location, and `merge` combines the results.
5. **Paint to Grid:** `paint(I, filled_cells)` updates the original grid with the '8' fillings.

## Program Versions:

**Note:**  Since you haven't provided the two programs to be improved upon, I can only offer variations on the core logic above. Implementing significant differences would require knowing the limitations and features of the existing (unprovided) code.


**Version 1: Using `prapply` for filling:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = objects(I, True, False, True)[0]
    one_indices = toindices(frozenset((1, loc) for v, loc in obj if v == 1))
    def fill_condition(i, j):
        return (8, (i, j)) if (1, (i, j)) in obj and index(I, (i, j)) == 9 else None
    filled_cells = mfilter(prapply(fill_condition, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))), lambda x: x is not None)
    return paint(I, filled_cells)
```

**Version 2:  Iterative approach with `while` loop:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = objects(I, True, False, True)[0]
    filled_cells = frozenset()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
        if v == 1:
            k = j - 1
            while k >= 0 and (1, (i, k)) in obj and index(I, (i, k)) == 9:
                filled_cells = insert((8, (i, k)), filled_cells)
                k -= 1
    return paint(I, filled_cells) 
```

**Version 3:  Pre-compute fill ranges:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = objects(I, True, False, True)[0]
    fill_ranges = {}
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
        if v == 1:
            start = j
            while start > 0 and (1, (i, start-1)) in obj:
                start -= 1
            fill_ranges[(i, j)] = start
    filled_cells = frozenset((8, (i, k)) for (i, j), start in fill_ranges.items() for k in range(start, j))
    return paint(I, filled_cells)
```

**Version 4:  Using `hmirror` and conditional filling:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = objects(I, True, False, True)[0]
    mirrored_I = hmirror(I)
    def fill_condition(i, j):
        return 8 if (1, (i, j)) in obj and mirrored_I[i][j] == 9 else I[i][j]
    return hmirror(tuple(tuple(fill_condition(i, j) for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I))))
```

**Version 5: Utilizing `shift` and object intersection:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = objects(I, True, False, True)[0]
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, -1))
    filled_cells = frozenset((8, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in shifted_obj if (1, (i, j)) in obj and index(I, (i, j)) == 9)
    return paint(I, filled_cells) 
```

**Explanation of Variations:**

- **Version 1:**  Uses `prapply` to efficiently apply a fill condition to every cell in the grid, filtering for the desired '8' cells.
- **Version 2:** Employs a `while` loop to iteratively fill cells leftwards from each '1' within the object.
- **Version 3:**  Pre-computes the start and end indices for filling in each row, optimizing the filling process.
- **Version 4:** Leverages `hmirror` to reverse the grid, making the filling logic simpler. Then, it applies a conditional fill and mirrors the grid back. 
- **Version 5:**  Shifts the object leftwards and finds the intersection with the original object. This intersection represents the cells to be filled with '8'. 

These are just a few examples of how the core logic can be implemented in different ways. The best approach will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
