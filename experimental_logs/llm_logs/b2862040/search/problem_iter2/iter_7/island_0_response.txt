## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color) within the grid, excluding the background color (most frequent color). Then, a border is drawn around each object using a specific color (in this case, '8'). The border extends one cell outward from the object's boundary. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input 0:** The input has a single object formed by '1's. The output adds a border of '8's around this object.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, but with a more complex object shape. The output again adds a one-cell border of '8's around the object.

**Input 2:** This input has a more scattered object. The output consistently applies the bordering rule, extending the border outward even when it creates a slightly larger output grid.

**Input 3:**  This input features multiple objects. The output demonstrates that the border is applied independently to each object, even when they are close together.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects, excluding background
  borders = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs) # Calculate border indices
  return underpaint(I, recolor(8, merge(borders)))  # Paint borders on the grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Calculate Border Indices:** `mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs)` calculates the border indices for each object using the `delta` function, which returns the indices surrounding a given patch.
3. **Paint Borders:** `underpaint(I, recolor(8, merge(borders)))` paints the borders by first recoloring the border indices to '8' and then using `underpaint` to apply them to the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT), objs)
  shifted_down = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), DOWN), objs)
  border_indices = merge((shifted_right, shifted_down))
  return underpaint(I, recolor(8, border_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Shift Objects:** Shifts each object one cell to the right and down.
3. **Merge Shifted Objects:** Merges the shifted objects to get the border indices.
4. **Paint Borders:** Same as version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  borders = mfilter(lambda obj: outbox(toindices(obj)), objs)
  return underpaint(I, recolor(8, borders))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Calculate Outbox:** Calculates the outbox of each object's indices, which represents the border indices.
3. **Paint Borders:** Same as version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def add_border(obj):
    shifted_right = shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT)
    shifted_down = shift(toindices(obj), DOWN)
    return combine(shifted_right, shifted_down)
  
  borders = mapply(add_border, objects(I, T, F, T))
  return underpaint(I, recolor(8, borders))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `add_border` Function:**  A helper function to calculate border indices by shifting the object right and down and combining the results.
2. **Identify Objects and Apply `add_border`:** Applies the `add_border` function to each object identified in the grid.
3. **Paint Borders:** Same as version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), objs)
  borders = mfilter(lambda indices: len(indices - toindices(extract(objs, lambda o: indices.issuperset(toindices(o))))) > 0, expanded_objs)
  return underpaint(I, recolor(8, borders))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Expand Objects:** Calculates the backdrop of each object, which includes the object itself and its surrounding cells.
3. **Filter Borders:** Filters the expanded objects to keep only the border indices. This is achieved by checking if each index in the expanded object is also present in the original object. If not, it is a border index.
4. **Paint Borders:** Same as version 1.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Each version provides a unique solution while adhering to the constraints of the DSL.
