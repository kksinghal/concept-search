## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation revolves around identifying objects (clusters of connected digits with the same value, excluding the background digit '9') in the input grid and extending them to the right by a specific amount. The extension seems to be dependent on the size of the object:

* **Smaller Objects:** Smaller objects (like single digits or small clusters) are extended to the right by a fixed amount, creating a rectangular shape.
* **Larger Objects:** Larger objects experience more subtle rightward extensions, sometimes just adding a few cells to their rightmost edge. 

Let's break down the transformations observed in each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The single '1' digit object remains unchanged.
- The larger object formed by '1' digits is extended to the right by one cell, forming a rectangle.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The two single '1' digit objects remain unchanged.
- The larger '1' object is extended to the right by one cell, creating a near-rectangular shape.
- A new '8' digit is added to the right of the bottom-most '1' in the large object. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
-  The three single '1' digit objects are extended rightwards to form horizontal lines touching the right edge of the grid.
- The '1' object near the bottom is extended to the right by one cell, creating a rectangle.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**
-  The large '1' object is extended rightwards by varying amounts, with additional '8' digits filling the space to create a rectangular shape.


## Code Generation:

It's challenging to generate precise code without the exact programs used to achieve the given outputs (Program_A and Program_B). However, we can leverage the functions used in the provided example programs and the insights from the transformation analysis to propose potential solutions. 

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)  # Identify objects excluding background '9'
    bg = mostcolor(I)  
    new_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        w = width(obj)
        extension = (3 - w) if w <= 3 else 1
        new_obj = set()
        for _, (i, j) in obj:
            for k in range(extension):
                new_obj.add((8, (i, j+k)))
        new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(new_objs)) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1.  **Identify Objects:**  `fgpartition(I)`  isolates objects within the input grid, excluding the background color '9'.
2.  **Iterate and Extend:**  The code iterates through each identified object (`obj`). For each object:
    *   **Calculate Extension:** It determines the object's width (`width(obj)`). Based on this width, it calculates an extension amount - smaller objects (width  ≤ 3) are extended to a width of 3, while larger objects are extended by 1 unit.
    *   **Extend Rightward:**  For every cell in the object, it adds new cells with the value '8' to the right, effectively extending the object.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** A new canvas with the background color and the original grid's dimensions is created (`canvas(bg, shape(I))`). The extended objects are then painted onto this canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    small_objs = sizefilter(objs, 1) 
    large_objs = difference(objs, small_objs)
    shifted_small_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 2)), small_objs)
    extended_large_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(backdrop(obj), I), large_objs)
    O = paint(paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shifted_small_objs), extended_large_objs)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects (connected components) from the input grid, excluding the background.
2.  **Categorize Objects:** Objects are categorized into 'small' (single cells) and 'large' using `sizefilter` and `difference`.
3.  **Transform Objects:**
    *   **Small Objects:** `shift(obj, (0, 2))` shifts each small object two cells to the right.
    *   **Large Objects:**  `backdrop(obj)`  creates a bounding box around each large object. `toobject` then extracts the grid content within these bounding boxes. 
4.  **Combine and Paint:** A canvas is created with the background color, and the transformed small and large objects are painted onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    extension = lambda obj: (0, 3 - width(obj)) if width(obj) < 4 else (0, 1)
    extended_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, extension(obj)), objs)
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), extended_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  Similar to the previous versions, objects are extracted using  `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Dynamic Extension:** A lambda function `extension` calculates the rightward shift for each object based on its width—smaller objects are extended to a width of 3, while larger ones are shifted by 1 unit.
3. **Apply Extension:**  `mapply` applies the `shift` function with the calculated extensions to each object.
4. **Paint on Canvas:**  Finally, a canvas is generated with the background color and the transformed objects are drawn onto it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    modified_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        if len(obj) < 4:  # Small object
            rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
            new_cells = {(8, (i, j)) for _, (i, j) in obj for j in range(rightmost_col + 1, rightmost_col + 4)}
            modified_objs.add(obj | new_cells)
        else:  # Large object
            modified_objs.add(obj)
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(modified_objs))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify and Categorize:**  Objects are identified excluding background using `fgpartition`.
2.  **Iterate and Modify:** The code iterates over each object (`obj`):
    *   **Small Objects:**  If the object size is less than 4, its rightmost column is determined. New cells with the value '8' are added to extend the object to the right until it's at least 3 cells wide.
    *   **Large Objects:**  Large objects are left unchanged.
3.  **Combine and Paint:** The modified objects are merged, and the final output is generated by painting them on a canvas of the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    extended_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        right_edge = {(i, rightmost(obj)) for _, (i, _) in obj}
        extension = {(8, (i, j)) for i, j in product(range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)+1), range(rightmost(obj)+1, rightmost(obj)+2))}
        extended_objs.add(obj | (extension if len(obj) > 1 else right_edge))
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(extended_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** Objects are extracted, excluding the background, using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2.  **Iterate and Extend:**  The code iterates through the objects:
    *   **Identify Right Edge:**  The rightmost column of each object is found (`rightmost(obj)`) and a set `right_edge` is created containing the coordinates of cells on this edge.
    *   **Create Extension:** An extension area (`extension`) is generated one cell to the right of the object's right edge.
    *   **Conditional Extension:** If the object has more than one cell, it's extended using the `extension` set. Otherwise, only the `right_edge` is added, preserving single-cell objects.
3.  **Combine and Paint:**  The extended objects are merged, and the result is painted onto a background canvas to produce the final output.

These code examples provide five diverse approaches to achieve the transformation observed in the input-output pairs. Remember that without the exact code for Program_A and Program_B, these solutions are best-guess attempts based on the provided information and may need adjustments to achieve perfect accuracy.
