## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of the digit '1' in the input grid and expanding them outwards by one layer using the digit '8'. The expansion occurs only within the bounds of the original grid, and pre-existing digits other than '1' are preserved.

**Example:**

```
Input:              Output:
9 9 9 9            9 9 9 9 9
9 1 1 9            9 8 8 8 9
9 1 9 9            9 8 1 8 9 
9 9 9 9            9 8 8 8 9
                       9 9 9 9 9 
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Find objects of '1'
  bg = mostcolor(I)                    # Identify background color
  for obj in objs:
    expanded_obj = toindices(obj)
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      expanded_obj = expanded_obj | dneighbors(cell) # Expand each object by one layer
    I = fill(I, 8, expanded_obj)     # Fill expanded area with '8'
  I = replace(I, 8, bg)              # Restore original background
  I = replace(I, 1, 8)                # Replace remaining '1' with '8'
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Finds objects composed solely of the digit '1', excluding the background.
2. **Expand Objects:**  Expands each object by one layer in all four directions.
3. **Fill Expanded Area:** Fills the expanded area with the digit '8'.
4. **Restore Background:** Reverts any '8' placed on the original background back to the background color.
5. **Replace Remaining '1's:**  Replaces any remaining '1's (part of the original objects) with '8's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)          # Get indices of all '1's
  expanded_indices = obj_indices       # Initialize expanded indices
  for loc in obj_indices:
    expanded_indices = expanded_indices | dneighbors(loc) # Expand by one layer
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))   # Create output grid with background color
  O = fill(O, 8, expanded_indices)   # Fill expanded indices with '8'
  O = cellwise(I, O, index(I, (0, 0))) # Combine with input, prioritizing input values
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Indices:**  Identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **Expand Indices:** Expands the set of indices by including the direct neighbors of each '1' index.
3. **Create Background Grid:** Generates a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
4. **Fill Expanded Area:** Fills the cells at the expanded indices in the output grid with the digit '8'.
5. **Combine with Input:** Overlays the input grid onto the output grid, prioritizing values from the input grid in case of overlap.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Find objects of '1'
  bg = mostcolor(I)                   # Identify background color
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))            # Create output grid with background color
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in backdrop(obj):         # Iterate over bounding box of each object
      if manhattan(initset(cell), obj) <= 1: # Check if cell is within one layer
        O = fill(O, 8, initset(cell))  # Fill cell with '8' if within range
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Objects:** Identifies objects composed solely of the digit '1'.
2. **Create Background Grid:** Creates a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Expand:** Iterates over the bounding box of each object. For each cell in the bounding box, it calculates the Manhattan distance to the object. If the distance is less than or equal to 1 (indicating it's within one layer of the object), it fills that cell in the output grid with '8'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I                               # Initialize output as input
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1:                # If cell is '1'
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]: # Check surrounding cells
          new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]): # Bounds check
            if O[new_i][new_j] == mostcolor(I): # If surrounding cell is background
              O = fill(O, 8, initset((new_i, new_j))) # Fill with '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Expand:**  The code iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains the digit '1', it checks its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).
3. **Fill Background Neighbors:** If a neighboring cell is within the grid's bounds and contains the background color, it is filled with the digit '8' in the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded_I = canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2)) # Padded grid
  padded_I = paint(padded_I, shift(asobject(I), (1,1))) # Place input in center
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))                 # Output grid
  for i in range(1, len(padded_I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(padded_I[0]) - 1):
      if padded_I[i][j] == 1:                       # If cell is '1'
        O = fill(O, 8, dneighbors((i-1,j-1)))      # Fill neighbors in output
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Padded Grid:**  A padded grid is created, larger than the input grid by one cell in all directions. This padding is filled with the background color.
2. **Center Input:**  The input grid is placed in the center of the padded grid.
3. **Iterate and Fill:**  The code iterates through the non-padded portion of the padded grid. If a cell contains the digit '1', its direct neighbors in the corresponding location of the output grid are filled with the digit '8'.
