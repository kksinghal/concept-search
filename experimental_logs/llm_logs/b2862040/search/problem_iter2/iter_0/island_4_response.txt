## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation revolves around identifying objects of a specific color (1 in the input), extending them horizontally to the left until they encounter a different color, and then changing the color of the extended object to 8. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The object at the left edge of the grid is extended leftward by one cell, changing from color 1 to 8.
* The larger object in the center is extended leftward by one cell, changing from color 1 to 8.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The small objects at the right edge are extended leftward, changing from color 1 to 8. The extension stops when encountering color 9.
* The object spanning multiple rows is extended to the left, changing from color 1 to 8 and stopping at color 9. 

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The object at the bottom is extended leftward, changing color and stopping at color 9.
* Other objects experience similar extensions, demonstrating the transformation's consistency across various object shapes and positions.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:**

* Objects are extended leftward, changing color and stopping at 9. This input reinforces the rule observed in previous examples.


## Code Improvement & Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    obj1 = objects(I, True, False, True) # Identify objects in the grid
    target_color = 1  # Define the color to be extended
    extension_color = 8  # Define the color of the extension
    def extend_object(obj):
        if color(obj) == target_color:
            min_j = leftmost(obj)
            for j in range(min_j - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate leftward from the object's leftmost point
                if index(I, (uppermost(obj), j)) != target_color: # Check if the current cell is of the target color
                    return shift(recolor(extension_color, obj), (0, j - min_j + 1))  # Extend and shift
        return obj  # Return the object unchanged if it's not the target color
    extended_objects = frozenset(extend_object(obj) for obj in obj1)
    O = paint(cover(I, obj1), extended_objects)  # Paint the extended objects back onto the grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify individual objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **Define Target and Extension Colors:** Set the color of objects to extend (`target_color`) and the color of the extension (`extension_color`).
3. **Extend Object Function:** Define a function `extend_object` that:
   - Checks if the object's color matches the `target_color`.
   - Finds the leftmost column index (`min_j`) of the object.
   - Iterates leftward from `min_j`, checking for cells not matching the `target_color`.
   - If a non-matching cell is found, the object is extended and shifted, changing its color to `extension_color`.
4. **Apply Extension:** Apply the `extend_object` function to all identified objects.
5. **Paint Extended Objects:** Paint the extended objects onto a cleared version of the original grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    target_color = 1
    extension_color = 8
    def process_row(row_index):
        row = I[row_index]
        new_row = list(row) 
        for j in range(len(row)):
            if row[j] == target_color:
                for k in range(j-1, -1, -1):
                    if row[k] != target_color:
                        new_row[k+1:j+1] = [extension_color]*(j-k)
                        break
                break
        return tuple(new_row)
    O = tuple(process_row(i) for i in range(len(I)))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Colors:** Define `target_color` and `extension_color`.
2. **Process Row Function:** Define `process_row` to handle each row:
   - Create a modifiable copy of the row (`new_row`).
   - Iterate through cells, searching for `target_color`.
   - When found, iterate leftward to find the first non-matching color.
   - Fill the cells between the non-matching color and the original `target_color` cell with `extension_color`.
3. **Apply to All Rows:** Apply `process_row` to all rows in the grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Identify objects
    def extend_left(obj):
        leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
        for j in range(leftmost_j - 1, -1, -1):
            if index(I, (uppermost(obj), j)) != 1: 
                return shift(recolor(8, obj), (0, j - leftmost_j + 1))
        return obj 
    extended_objs = frozenset(extend_left(obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1)
    O = paint(cover(I, objs), extended_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Version 1, but with a more concise `extend_left` function.
* Directly uses the target and extension colors (1 and 8) within the code.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        for k in range(j-1, -1, -1):
          if row[k] != 1:
            O = fill(O, 8, connect((i, k+1), (i, j)))
            break
        else:
          O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Creates a blank canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input.
* Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
* If a cell has the target value (1), it iterates leftward.
* It fills the canvas with the extension color (8) from the first non-target value it encounters to the original target cell.
* If no non-target value is found to the left, it fills only the current cell with the extension color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    def extend_row(row):
        new_row = list(row)
        for j in range(len(row)):
            if row[j] == 1:
                k = j - 1
                while k >= 0 and row[k] == 1:
                    k -= 1
                new_row[k + 1:j + 1] = [8] * (j - k)
        return tuple(new_row)
    O = tuple(extend_row(row) for row in I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Defines an `extend_row` function that processes each row individually.
* Uses a `while` loop to efficiently find the leftmost extent of consecutive target values (1).
* Replaces the target values with the extension color (8) using slice assignment.
* Applies the `extend_row` function to each row of the input grid to generate the output grid.

These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. You can choose the version that best suits your needs or use them as inspiration to create even more refined solutions.
