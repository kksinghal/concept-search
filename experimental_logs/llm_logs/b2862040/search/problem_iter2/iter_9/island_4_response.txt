## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of a specific color (1) within the input grid and extending them horizontally to the right with a different color (8) until they hit another object. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The single object of '1's is extended rightwards with '8's until it reaches the right edge of the grid. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  Multiple objects of '1's are extended. The extension halts upon encountering another object, including the grid boundaries.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** Similar to the previous cases, '1' objects are extended rightwards with '8's, stopping at other objects or boundaries.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:** Again, the transformation consistently extends '1' objects rightwards with '8's, respecting existing object boundaries.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL, inspired by the provided programs and tailored to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, (height(I), width(I) + 1)) # Create a canvas one column wider than input
  for i, row in enumerate(I): # Iterate through rows
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      O = fill(O, value, ((i, j), (i, j))) # Copy input values to output
      if value == 1: # If the current cell is part of the object
        for k in range(j + 1, width(O)): # Check from next column to the right edge
          if index(I, (i, k)) != 9: # Stop if another object is encountered
            break
          O = fill(O, 8, ((i, k), (i, k))) # Fill with extension color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a canvas one column wider than the input to accommodate potential extensions without modifying the original grid.
2. Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. Copies the input value directly to the output canvas.
4. If the current cell value is '1' (target object), it iterates horizontally to the right, filling with '8' (extension color) until it encounters a non-background value in the input grid, indicating another object or the grid boundary.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid with background
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True): # Iterate through objects
    if color(obj) == 1: # Process only objects with target color
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # For each row occupied by the object
        j = rightmost(obj) + 1 # Start from the column right of the object
        while j < width(I) and index(I, (i, j)) == 9: # Extend right until a non-background cell
          O = fill(O, 8, ((i, j), (i, j))) # Fill with extension color
          j += 1
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the original object on the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Initializes the output grid with the background color.
2. Identifies objects in the input grid.
3. For each object of the target color ('1'), it iterates through its rows.
4. Starts from the column to the right of the object and extends horizontally with the extension color ('8') until a non-background cell is encountered in the input grid.
5. Paints the original object onto the modified grid to preserve its shape.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1:
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and index(I, (i, k)) == 9:
          O = fill(O, 8, ((i, k), (i, k)))
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1.  Initializes the output grid 'O' directly with the input grid 'I'.
2.  Iterates through each cell of the input grid using nested loops for row index 'i' and column index 'j'.
3.  If a cell with value '1' is found:
    *   It initializes a counter 'k' to the next column (j+1).
    *   Enters a loop that continues as long as 'k' is within the grid bounds and the corresponding cell in the input grid has the background color (9).
    *   Inside the loop, it fills the cell at (i, k) in the output grid with the extension color (8) and increments 'k' to move to the next column.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      min_row, max_row = uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)
      leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
      for i in range(min_row, max_row + 1):
        for j in range(leftmost_col, width(I)):
          if index(I, (i, j)) == 9:
            O = fill(O, 8, ((i, j), (i, j)))
          else:
            break
    O = paint(O, obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Initializes an empty canvas 'O' with the same dimensions as the input grid 'I', filled with the background color (9).
2.  Extracts all objects from the input grid using the `objects` function. The parameters indicate that objects should be identified based on connected cells with the same color, disregarding diagonals, and excluding the background.
3.  Iterates through each detected object 'obj' in the 'objs' set.
4.  If the color of the current object 'obj' is 1:
    *   Determines the bounding box of the object using `uppermost`, `lowermost`, and `leftmost` functions to find the minimum and maximum row indices and the leftmost column index.
    *   Iterates through the rows and columns within the object's bounding box.
    *   Fills each cell within the bounding box that has a value of 9 in the input grid with the extension color (8) in the output grid. The filling process stops for each row when a non-background cell is encountered (indicated by the `break` statement), effectively extending the object rightward until it hits another object or the grid boundary.
5.  Paints the original object 'obj' onto the output grid 'O' to preserve the object's shape and original color. This ensures that the extending color does not overwrite the object itself.
6.  Finally, returns the modified output grid 'O'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I))  # Initialize output with background
  for i in range(height(I)):
    extend = False  # Flag to indicate if extension is needed
    for j in range(width(I)):
      O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), ((i, j), (i, j)))  # Copy input to output
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 1: 
        extend = True  # Start extending if '1' is found
      if extend and index(I, (i, j)) == 9:  
        O = fill(O, 8, ((i, j), (i, j)))  # Extend with '8'
      else:
        extend = False  # Stop extending if non-'9' is encountered
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Initializes the output grid 'O' with the same dimensions as the input grid 'I', filled with the background color (9) using the `canvas` function.
2.  Iterates through each cell of the input grid using nested loops for row index 'i' and column index 'j'.
3.  Copies the value from the input grid 'I' to the corresponding cell in the output grid 'O' using `index` and `fill`. This ensures that all original values are preserved in the output.
4.  Uses a flag variable `extend` to keep track of whether the current cell should be extended. 
    *   Sets the `extend` flag to `True` if a cell with value 1 is encountered, indicating the start of an object to be extended.
    *   If the `extend` flag is `True` and the current cell in the input grid has the background value (9), fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with the extension color (8).
    *   Resets the `extend` flag to `False` when a non-'9' value is encountered, signaling the end of the extension. This ensures that the extension stops when it encounters another object or the grid boundary.
5.  Returns the modified output grid 'O' after processing all cells.
