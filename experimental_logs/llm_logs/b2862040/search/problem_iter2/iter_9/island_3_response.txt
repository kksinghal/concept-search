## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Objects:** The program identifies objects formed by connected cells of the same color (excluding the background color, which is the most frequent color). Objects are considered connected if they share a side (not just a corner).

2. **Create Outbox:** For each identified object, the program creates an "outbox". The outbox is a one-cell thick border surrounding the object.

3. **Expand Canvas:** The original input grid is placed on a larger canvas, extending one cell in each direction (top, bottom, left, right).

4. **Draw Outbox:** The outbox for each object is drawn on the expanded canvas using the color '8'. The outbox is drawn directly adjacent to the object's original border.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify background color
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects
  O = canvas(bg, add(shape(I), (2, 2)))  # Create expanded canvas
  O = fill(O, I, {(i + 1, j + 1) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I))})  # Place input grid onto canvas
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, 8, shift(outbox(toindices(obj)), (1, 1)))  # Draw the outbox
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly calculates the expanded canvas size and uses nested loops to fill the input grid onto the canvas.
* It shifts the `outbox` by (1, 1) to draw it correctly on the expanded canvas.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = canvas(bg, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))  # Directly specify canvas dimensions
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i + 1, j + 1)})  # Place input grid onto canvas
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, 8, shift(outbox(toindices(obj)), (1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly specifies the dimensions of the expanded canvas.
* It iterates through the input grid's cells and fills corresponding cells on the expanded canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = vconcat((canvas(bg, (1, width(I) + 2)),), hconcat((canvas(bg, (height(I), 1)),), vconcat((hconcat((canvas(bg, (height(I), 1)),), I, (canvas(bg, (height(I), 1)),)),), (canvas(bg, (1, width(I) + 2)),))))  # Construct canvas with borders
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, 8, shift(outbox(toindices(obj)), (1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version constructs the expanded canvas by concatenating the input grid with borders of the background color.
* It uses `hconcat` and `vconcat` to add borders around the input grid. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  padded_I = canvas(bg, add(shape(I), (2, 2)))
  padded_I = fill(padded_I, I, {(i + 1, j + 1) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I))})
  O = canvas(bg, shape(padded_I))
  for i in range(height(padded_I)):
    for j in range(width(padded_I)):
      if (i - 1, j - 1) in {(a, b) for obj in objs for a, b in toindices(obj)}:
        O = fill(O, padded_I[i][j], {(i, j)})  # Copy object cells
      else:
        O = underfill(O, 8, {(i, j)})  # Draw outbox for other cells
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version first creates a padded version of the input grid (`padded_I`) and then iterates over its cells.
* It copies object cells directly from `padded_I` to the output grid (`O`) and uses `underfill` to draw the outbox for other cells.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = canvas(bg, add(shape(I), (2, 2)))
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, 8, shift(outbox(toindices(obj)), (1, 1)))  # Draw outbox first
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i + 1, j + 1)})  # Then place input grid onto canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version draws the outboxes on the expanded canvas first. 
* It then iterates through the input grid and fills the corresponding cells on the canvas, overwriting any outbox segments that might be present.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. They showcase the flexibility of the DSL and highlight various ways to manipulate grids and objects within the given constraints.
