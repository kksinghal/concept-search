## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all input-output pairs follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Object Extension:** All objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background color) are extended to the right by one cell if the right neighbor cell is the background color.
2. **Color Change:**  The extended portions of the objects have their color changed to '8'.
3. **Canvas Expansion:** The canvas is expanded by one column to the right to accommodate the object extensions.

**Example (Input 0 -> Output 0):**
- Notice the objects formed by digit '1'. Each of these objects are extended one cell to the right with digit '8' in the output. 
- The canvas size is increased from 10x10 to 10x11.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    extended_objs = frozenset(
        toobject(combine(toindices(obj), {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg}), I)
        for obj in objs
    )
    extended_objs = recolor(8, extended_objs)
    O = paint(canvas(bg, (height(I), width(I) + 1)), extended_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background and Objects:** 
   - `bg = mostcolor(I)`: Determines the background color.
   - `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:  Identifies all objects in the input grid.

2. **Extend Objects:**
   -  The code iterates through each object (`for obj in objs`) and calculates the indices to extend (`{(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg}`). It then combines these indices with the original object indices using `combine` and converts them back to an object representation with the original colors from the grid using `toobject`.
   -  `extended_objs = frozenset(...)`:  Stores the extended objects as a frozenset.

3. **Recolor Extended Parts:**
   -  `extended_objs = recolor(8, extended_objs)`: Colors the extended parts of the objects with '8'.

4. **Paint on Expanded Canvas:**
   - `O = paint(canvas(bg, (height(I), width(I) + 1)), extended_objs)`: 
     - Creates a new canvas with an extra column on the right, filled with the background color.
     - Paints the extended and recolored objects onto this canvas.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = canvas(bg, (height(I), width(I) + 1))
  for obj in objs:
    for c, (i, j) in obj:
      O = fill(O, c, {(i, j)})
      if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Determines the background color (`bg`) and identifies objects (`objs`). Creates a new canvas `O` with an added column.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** Iterates over each cell of each object. If a cell's right neighbor is the background, it fills the corresponding cell on the new canvas with '8'. Otherwise, it fills with the cell's original color.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    extended_indices = set()
    for obj in objs:
        for _, (i, j) in obj:
            extended_indices.add((i,j))
            if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg:
                extended_indices.add((i, j + 1))
    O = paint(canvas(bg, (height(I), width(I) + 1)), recolor(8, frozenset(extended_indices)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Extensions:** The code identifies all indices that need to be filled, including the original object cells and the extension cells, storing them in `extended_indices`.
2. **Paint and Recolor:** It creates a new canvas and uses `recolor` to change the color of all indices in `extended_indices` to '8' before painting them onto the canvas.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (height(I), width(I) + 1))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i,j)})
      if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the process by iterating directly through each cell of the input grid. It copies the cell value to the output grid and extends the object with '8' to the right if applicable. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (0,1)) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, (height(I), width(I) + 1)), recolor(8, merge(shifted_objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Recolor:**  This version shifts all objects to the right by one cell (`shifted_objs`) and then recolors all cells of the shifted objects to '8' using `recolor` and `merge`.
2. **Paint on Canvas:** Finally, it paints the recolored shifted objects onto a new canvas with an extra column.

Each version provides a distinct approach to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic.
