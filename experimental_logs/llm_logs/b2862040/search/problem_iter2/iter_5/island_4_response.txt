## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves extending the leftmost object in each row to the right until it touches another object or the edge of the grid. The extended area is filled with a new color (8 in this case). Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The single 1-colored object in each row extends rightward, filling the space with 8 until it either reaches another 1 or the grid boundary.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Similar to Input_0, the leftmost 1-colored object extends. Notice that if the object spans multiple rows, the extension continues on each row individually.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**  Again, the same logic applies. The transformation doesn't distinguish between different object shapes.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:** This example highlights that the extension occurs independently for each row, even if the leftmost object is visually connected across rows.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions inspired by the provided programs but utilizing different strategies and function combinations from the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(9, shape(I)) # Create a canvas of 9s with the same shape as input
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if I[i][j] != 9:  # Find the first non-9 cell (object)
                O = fill(O, 8, ((i, j), (i, width(I)-1))) # Fill horizontally from object to the right edge
                break # Move to the next row
    O = cellwise(I, O, I[0][0]) # Merge the original objects onto the canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** A canvas of 9s is created with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The program iterates through each row. Upon finding the first non-9 cell (part of the leftmost object), it fills the canvas horizontally from that cell to the right edge with the color 8.
3. **Merge with Original:** The `cellwise` function merges the original input grid onto the canvas.  Wherever the canvas and input grid have the same value, that value is kept. Otherwise, the input grid's value is used, ensuring the original objects are placed on top.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I,T,F,T) # Get all objects in the grid
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj) # Find the leftmost column of the object
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)+1): # For each row the object occupies
      O = fill(O, 8, ((i, leftmost_j), (i, width(I)-1))) # Fill from leftmost column to right edge
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code identifies all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** It iterates through each object.
3. **Fill Rows:** For every row the object occupies, the program fills the grid horizontally from the object's leftmost column to the right edge with the new color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(9, shape(I))
    for i in range(height(I)):
        row_obj = next((v for v, (r, c) in asobject(I) if r == i and v != 9), None) # Find first non-9 value in row
        if row_obj:
            O = fill(O, 8, ((i, I[i].index(row_obj)), (i, width(I)-1))) # Fill from the first non-9 cell
    return cellwise(I, O, I[0][0]) # Merge with original objects 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Iteration:** Similar to version 1, it creates a 9s canvas and iterates through rows.
2. **Find Object Start:** Instead of nested loops, it finds the first non-9 value (object's color) in each row directly.
3. **Fill and Merge:**  It fills the canvas horizontally on that row starting from the object's position and merges it with the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        try:
            first_obj_index = row.index(next(filter(lambda x: x != 9, row))) # Find first non-9 cell
            O = fill(O, 8, ((i, first_obj_index), (i, width(I)-1))) # Fill to the right
        except StopIteration: # Handle rows with no objects
            pass
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Iteration:** It iterates directly through rows without creating a separate canvas.
2. **Find and Fill:**  It finds the index of the first non-9 cell in each row and fills the grid from that index to the right edge.
3. **Error Handling:** It handles cases where a row might not have any object (all 9s) using a `try-except` block. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I 
    for i in range(height(I)):
        obj_indices = {j for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] != 9} # Get indices of object cells in row
        if obj_indices:
            leftmost_index = min(obj_indices)
            O = fill(O, 8, ((i, leftmost_index), (i, width(I)-1)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification & Index Set:**  It works directly on the input grid and uses a set to store indices of object cells in each row.
2. **Find Leftmost and Fill:** If the set is not empty (object exists), it finds the minimum index (leftmost position) and fills the grid to the right.


These five versions provide a diverse set of approaches to accomplish the same grid transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and different coding styles. Each leverages a unique combination of functions and logic, offering a comprehensive understanding of how to solve this transformation task.
