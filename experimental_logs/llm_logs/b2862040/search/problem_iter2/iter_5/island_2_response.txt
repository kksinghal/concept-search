## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background color 9) in the input grid and extending them to the left by adding a new column of the same color as the object. The new column is filled with the digit '8'. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The single object formed by the digit '1' is extended to the left with a column of '8's.

**Pair 1:**  Both objects formed by the digit '1' are extended to the left with a column of '8's. Additionally, the bottom right object has its bottom edge extended by one cell to the left.

**Pair 2:** Similar to previous pairs, the objects formed by digits '1' are extended leftward with '8's. 

**Pair 3:**  Again, the objects formed by '1' are extended leftward with '8's. Notably, the object spanning the bottom two rows is treated as a single object for the extension.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL, along with explanations for each:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  new_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    left_edge = frozenset((i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))
    new_objs = new_objs | recolor(EIGHT, shift(left_edge, (-1, 0)))
  return paint(I, merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate and extend:** The code iterates through each object, calculates its left edge, shifts it one position to the left, and recolors it to '8'. 
3. **Paint the extension:** The extended edges are combined and painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(recolor(EIGHT, shift(frozenset((i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)), (-1, 0))) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic of version 1 into a single line using nested comprehensions. It directly paints the recoloured and shifted left edges of all objects onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(prapply(lambda i, obj: frozenset({(EIGHT, (i - 1, leftmost(obj))) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}), range(len(I)), objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `prapply` to iterate over a range and the set of objects. For each object, it creates a set of cells representing the left edge shifted one position left and filled with '8'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(I, merge(frozenset((EIGHT, (i, j - 1)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == leftmost(obj)) for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly iterates through each object's indices. If an index belongs to the leftmost column of the object, it is shifted left and added to a set with color '8'. Finally, the collected cells are merged and painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, shift(frozenset((i, 0) for i in range(height(obj))), (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj) - 1))), objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version first normalizes each object by moving its upper-left corner to the origin. It then generates a vertical line of '8's with the object's height and shifts it to the correct position before painting it onto the grid.

These are just five examples, and many other variations are possible using the DSL functions. The key is to identify the core elements of the transformation (object identification, edge calculation, shifting, and recoloring) and combine the DSL functions creatively to achieve the desired outcome.
