## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and outlining them with the digit '8'. The outlined object expands the original object's bounding box by one cell in all directions.

**Example:**

Input Grid:

```
9 9 9 9
9 1 1 9
9 1 9 9
9 9 9 9
```

Output Grid:

```
9 9 9 9 9 9
9 8 8 8 8 9
9 8 1 1 8 9
9 8 1 9 8 9
9 8 8 8 8 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 
```

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        O = fill(O, 8, outbox(toindices(obj)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`. 
2. **Iterate and Outline:** The code iterates through each object `obj` and outlines it with '8's:
    - `toindices(obj)` gets the indices of the object's cells.
    - `outbox(toindices(obj))` computes the outer bounding box indices.
    - `fill(O, 8, ...)` fills the outer bounding box with '8's in the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2)) 
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underpaint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, first(toindices(obj))), obj), (1,1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))` creates an output grid `O` filled with the background color, two cells larger in each dimension.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** The code iterates over each object in the input:
    - `index(I, first(toindices(obj)))` retrieves the color of the first cell of the object.
    - `recolor(..., obj)` creates a new object with the retrieved color.
    - `shift(..., (1, 1))` shifts the object by one cell down and right.
    - `underpaint(O, ...)` paints the shifted object onto the canvas `O`, only overwriting background cells.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = vconcat((canvas(mostcolor(I), (1, width(I))), I, canvas(mostcolor(I), (1, width(I)))))
    O = hconcat((canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(O), 1)), O, canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(O), 1))))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = fill(O, 8, shift(outbox(toindices(obj)), (1, 1)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Expand Canvas:** 
   - `vconcat(...)` adds rows of background color above and below the input grid.
   - `hconcat(...)` adds columns of background color to the left and right.
2. **Iterate and Outline:** The code iterates over each object:
    - `outbox(toindices(obj))` gets the outer bounding box indices.
    - `shift(..., (1, 1))` shifts the box by one cell down and right to align with the expanded canvas.
    - `fill(O, 8, ...)` fills the shifted bounding box with '8's. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))
    for obj in objs:
        shifted_obj = shift(obj, (1, 1))
        O = paint(O, shifted_obj)
        O = fill(O, 8, outbox(toindices(shifted_obj)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(...)` creates a larger output grid `O` filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate, Shift, and Outline:** For each object:
   - `shift(obj, (1, 1))` shifts the object down and right.
   - `paint(O, shifted_obj)` paints the shifted object onto the canvas.
   - `fill(O, 8, outbox(toindices(shifted_obj)))` outlines the painted object with '8's.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, 8, outbox(frozenset({(i, j)})))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** The code iterates over every cell in the input grid.
2. **Outline Non-Background Cells:** If a cell is not the background color:
   - `outbox(frozenset({(i, j)})))` creates a 3x3 box around the cell. 
   - `fill(O, 8, ...)` fills this box with '8's in the output grid.
