## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples involves extending objects of a specific color (target color = 1) leftward using an extension color (8) until they hit an obstacle (any color other than the target color). 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** 
* The two separate objects with color 1 are extended leftwards using color 8 until they hit the boundary (color 9). 

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
* Similar to Input_0, objects with color 1 are extended leftwards. 
* Notice how the extension stops upon encountering colors other than 1, creating a "hugging" effect against the obstacle.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
* The transformation extends color 1 objects leftwards, demonstrating the ability to handle more complex object shapes and obstacle placements.

**Input_3 - Output_3:**
* This example further emphasizes the "hugging" effect, with extensions stopping at the rightmost point of any obstacle encountered.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieves the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Identify objects, excluding background
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  def extend_left(obj):
    if color(obj) == target_color:  # Only process target color objects
      left_border = hfrontier((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj) - 1))  # Leftward frontier
      extension_area = intersection(backdrop(obj), left_border) # Area for extension
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, -1, -1): 
        if index(I, (uppermost(obj), j)) != target_color: # Stop at obstacle
          extension_area = frozenset((i, k) for i, k in extension_area if k >= j + 1)
          break
      return recolor(extension_color, toobject(extension_area, I)) # Extend with color
    return obj
  extended_objs = frozenset(extend_left(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(I, extended_objs)  # Paint extended objects onto original grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects in the input grid using `objects` function (excluding background).
2. **Iterate and Extend:** It iterates through each object and checks its color. If it matches the target color, it calculates the leftward frontier and the extension area. Then, it extends the object leftward using `recolor` and `toobject` functions. 
3. **Paint:** Finally, it paints all the extended objects back onto the original grid using the `paint` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  def extend_row(row, start_j):
    new_row = list(row) 
    for j in range(start_j, -1, -1):
      if new_row[j] != target_color:
        break
      new_row[j] = extension_color
    return tuple(new_row)
  new_grid = []
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    extension_start = len(row)
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == target_color:
        extension_start = j
        break
    new_grid.append(extend_row(row, extension_start))
  O = tuple(new_grid)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** This version iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Find Extension Start:** It finds the rightmost occurrence of the target color in the row, marking the start of the extension.
3. **Extend Leftward:** It extends the target color leftward from the starting point until it encounters a different color.
4. **Construct New Grid:** It constructs a new grid with the extended rows.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    target_color = 1
    extension_color = 8
    def extend_object(obj):
        if color(obj) != target_color:
            return obj
        min_j = leftmost(obj)
        extension = frozenset(((extension_color, (i, j)) for i, j in toindices(obj) | {(i, j) for i, j in product(range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1), range(min_j - 1, -1, -1)) if index(I, (i, j)) == 9}))
        return extension
    extended_objects = frozenset(extend_object(obj) for obj in objs)
    O = paint(cover(I, objs), extended_objects)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify objects in the input grid excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object, if it's the target color, determine its leftmost column (`min_j`). Create an extension set by combining the object's indices with indices to its left until a non-9 cell is encountered. Recolor the extension with the extension color.
3. **Paint Extensions:** Paint the extended objects back onto a cleared grid (original grid with objects removed).


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    target_color = 1
    extension_color = 8
    def extend_object(obj):
        if color(obj) != target_color:
            return obj
        ref_i = uppermost(obj)  # Use uppermost row as reference
        min_j = leftmost(obj)
        extension = frozenset({(extension_color, (ref_i, j)) for j in range(min_j - 1, -1, -1) if index(I, (ref_i, j)) == 9})
        return obj | extension  # Combine original object with extension
    extended_objects = frozenset(extend_object(obj) for obj in objs)
    O = paint(I, extended_objects)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object, if it's the target color, find its leftmost column (`min_j`) and use its uppermost row (`ref_i`) as a reference. Create an extension set by including cells to the left of `min_j` on the `ref_i` row until a non-9 cell is encountered. Combine the original object's cells with the extension cells, all colored with the extension color.
3. **Paint Extensions:** Directly paint the extended objects onto the original grid, overwriting any existing cells.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    target_color = 1
    extension_color = 8
    def process_row(row):
        new_row = list(row)
        extending = False
        for j in range(len(row) - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_row[j] == target_color:
                extending = True
            elif extending:
                if new_row[j] == 9:
                    new_row[j] = extension_color
                else:
                    extending = False
        return tuple(new_row)
    O = tuple(process_row(row) for row in I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** The code iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Extend from Right to Left:** For each row, it iterates through the cells from right to left. If it encounters the target color, it sets an "extending" flag. While this flag is set, it replaces any '9' with the extension color until it encounters a non-target and non-'9' cell.
3. **Construct Output Grid:** It constructs the output grid by processing each row.

These are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation using different approaches. Each version leverages different combinations of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided language.
