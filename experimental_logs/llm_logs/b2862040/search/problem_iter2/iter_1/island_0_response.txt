## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color) in the input grid and extending them horizontally to the right by one cell. This extension should only occur if the cell to the right is part of the background color (most frequent color in the grid).

**Example:**

Input:

```
9 9 9 9
9 1 1 9
9 1 9 9
9 9 9 9
```

Output:

```
9 9 9 9 9
9 1 1 9 9
9 1 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9
```

Here, the objects formed by the digit '1' are extended one cell to the right.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the described transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify objects, including diagonals, without background
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)

  # Create a set to store modified objects
  modified_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    # Shift the object one cell to the right
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, RIGHT)

    # Get the intersection between the shifted object and the input grid
    intersection = toobject(toindices(shifted_obj), I)

    # Check if the intersection is empty (meaning the shifted area is background)
    if len(intersection) == 0:
      # If empty, add the shifted object to the modified objects set
      modified_objs.add(shifted_obj)

  # Paint all modified objects onto a copy of the input grid
  O = I
  for obj in modified_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)

  # Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through each object and checks if a rightward shift would intersect with any existing object. If not, it paints the shifted object onto a copy of the input grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get background color
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)

  # Get all object indices, excluding background
  obj_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, bg_color))

  # Identify indices to be filled
  fill_indices = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in obj_indices if j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == bg_color)

  # Fill identified indices with their corresponding object colors
  O = fill(I, 8, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version directly identifies the background color and iterates over all non-background cell indices. For each such index, it checks if the cell to its right is background and fills it with '8' if true.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(hconcat(I, [[mostcolor(I)] * len(I[0])]), asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:** This version cleverly utilizes grid manipulation. It first concatenates the input grid with a column of the background color to its right. Then, it paints the original grid as an object onto this extended grid. This effectively achieves the rightward extension.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a lambda function to check if a cell's right neighbor is background
  is_right_bg = lambda i, j: j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == mostcolor(I)

  # Apply the lambda function to each cell of the input grid, creating a boolean mask
  mask = prapply(is_right_bg, *pair(astuple(height(I), 0), astuple(0, width(I))))

  # Fill the cells where the mask is True with '8'
  O = underfill(I, 8, mask)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version uses a lambda function and the `prapply` function to create a boolean mask representing cells eligible for rightward extension. It then uses `underfill` to apply the extension only to background cells.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define a function to extend an object to the right
  def extend_right(obj):
    return toobject(toindices(shift(obj, RIGHT)), I)

  # Apply the extend_right function to each object, filtering out empty intersections
  extended_objs = sfilter(apply(extend_right, objects(I, T, T, T)), lambda obj: len(obj) > 0)

  # Paint the extended objects onto a copy of the input grid
  O = I
  for obj in extended_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)

  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version defines a dedicated function `extend_right` to handle the extension logic for individual objects. It applies this function to all objects, filters out unsuccessful extensions, and paints the valid extensions onto the grid.


Each version leverages different combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same goal, showcasing the flexibility of the language and providing diverse solutions.
