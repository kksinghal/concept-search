## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the least common color in the input grid and expanding them horizontally. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
- The least common color is '1'.
- All connected '1's are identified as a single object.
- This object is expanded horizontally by one cell on both sides, replacing any '9's encountered.
- The expanded object is re-colored to '8'.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
- Same logic as Input_0, but the object expands downwards beyond the initial grid boundary.

**Input_2 - Output_2:** 
- Same logic, but with additional horizontal expansion on the right side due to the object's shape.

**Input_3 - Output_3:**
- Same logic, showcasing expansion across different object shapes and positions.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    target_color = leastcolor(I)
    target_object = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == target_color)
    expansion_indices = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] - 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}, toindices(target_object))
    expanded_object = toobject(combine(toindices(target_object), expansion_indices), I)
    O = paint(cover(I, target_object), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_object))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = leastcolor(I)`**: Identifies the least common color in the input grid.
2. **`target_object = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == target_color)`**: Extracts the object formed by the target color.
3. **`expansion_indices = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] - 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}, toindices(target_object))`**: Generates a set of indices representing the horizontal expansion of the target object.
4. **`expanded_object = toobject(combine(toindices(target_object), expansion_indices), I)`**: Creates the expanded object by combining the original object's indices with the expansion indices.
5. **`O = paint(cover(I, target_object), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_object))`**: Paints the expanded object (colored '8') onto a copy of the input grid where the original object has been removed.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    target_color = leastcolor(I)
    target_indices = ofcolor(I, target_color)
    expanded_indices =  frozenset({(i, j + dj) for i, j in target_indices for dj in (-1, 1)})
    expanded_object = toobject(combine(target_indices, expanded_indices), I)
    O = paint(cover(I, recolor(target_color, target_indices)), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_object))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = leastcolor(I)`**:  Identifies the least common color.
2. **`target_indices = ofcolor(I, target_color)`**:  Gets indices of cells with the target color.
3. **`expanded_indices = frozenset({(i, j + dj) for i, j in target_indices for dj in (-1, 1)})`**:  Computes indices for horizontal expansion.
4. **`expanded_object = toobject(combine(target_indices, expanded_indices), I)`**: Creates the expanded object using combined indices.
5. **`O = paint(cover(I, recolor(target_color, target_indices)), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_object))`**:  Paints the expanded object onto a cleaned grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = leastcolor(I)
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == c)
  shifted_objs = (shift(obj,(0,-1)), shift(obj,(0,1)))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj),recolor(EIGHT, obj)), recolor(EIGHT, merge(shifted_objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`c = leastcolor(I)`**:  Finds the least frequent color in the grid.
2. **`obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == c)`**: Isolates the object made of the least frequent color.
3. **`shifted_objs = (shift(obj,(0,-1)), shift(obj,(0,1)))`**:  Creates two copies of the object, shifting them left and right by one cell.
4. **`O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj),recolor(EIGHT, obj)), recolor(EIGHT, merge(shifted_objs)))`**: 
    - Removes the original object from the grid.
    - Paints the original object and its shifted copies back onto the grid, all in the color '8'.

## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  min_color = leastcolor(I)
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, min_color))
  expanded_obj = toobject(mapply(lambda p: {(p[0],p[1]-1),(p[0],p[1]),(p[0],p[1]+1)}, toindices(obj)), I)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`min_color = leastcolor(I)`**: Finds the least common color in the input grid.
2. **`obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, min_color))`**: Extracts the object formed by the least common color.
3. **`expanded_obj = toobject(mapply(lambda p: {(p[0],p[1]-1),(p[0],p[1]),(p[0],p[1]+1)}, toindices(obj)), I)`**: Creates the horizontally expanded object by taking each cell of the original object and including its immediate left and right neighbors.
4. **`O = paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_obj))`**: Paints the expanded object (in color 8) onto the grid where the original object was removed.


## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  object_indices = ofcolor(I, target_color)
  expanded_indices = frozenset((i, j + dj) for i, j in object_indices for dj in range(-1, 2)) 
  expanded_object = toobject(expanded_indices, I)
  O = paint(cover(I, recolor(target_color, object_indices)), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_object))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = leastcolor(I)`**:  Determine the least frequent color in the grid.
2. **`object_indices = ofcolor(I, target_color)`**:  Identify the positions of all cells with the target color.
3. **`expanded_indices = frozenset((i, j + dj) for i, j in object_indices for dj in range(-1, 2))`**:  For each cell of the target object, include its position, the position to its left, and the position to its right.
4. **`expanded_object = toobject(expanded_indices, I)`**:  Construct the expanded object using the collected positions and the original grid values.
5. **`O = paint(cover(I, recolor(target_color, object_indices)), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_object))`**:  Remove the original object from the grid and paint the expanded object in color '8' in its place.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same horizontal expansion transformation, utilizing a variety of DSL functions and logic.
