## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying distinct objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background) in the input grid and extending them to the right.  The extension consists of adding a new column to the right of each object, filled with the color '8'. The size of this extension appears to be related to the width of the object: wider objects get a wider extension. The exact relationship seems to vary slightly across examples, suggesting a more complex rule might be involved.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    O = canvas(bg, (height(I), width(I) + 3))  # Wider canvas
    for obj in objs:
        extension_width = width(obj) + 1  # Extension width based on object width
        O = paint(O, obj | {(8, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
                        for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1 + extension_width)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The background color (`bg`) is determined, and a canvas (`O`) is created, 3 cells wider than the input grid.
2. **Object Iteration:** The program iterates through each object (`obj`) in the input grid.
3. **Extension Calculation:**  The width of the extension is calculated as the object's width plus 1.
4. **Painting:** The object is painted onto the canvas. Then, a column of '8's is added to the right, extending the object's width.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(shift(obj, (0,width(obj) + 1)) for obj in objs))
    O = paint(O, merge(recolor(8, shift(obj, (0, 1))) for obj in objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Identify the background color (`bg`) and extract foreground objects (`objs`).
2. **Shifting Objects:** Shift each object to the right by a distance equal to its width plus 1.
3. **Recoloring and Merging:** Recolor the shifted objects to '8' and merge them with the original grid, overwriting the background.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    O = canvas(bg, (height(I), width(I) + max(width(obj) for obj in objs) + 1))
    for obj in objs:
        O = paint(O, obj)
        O = underfill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(O))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Determine the background color and extract foreground objects. Create a canvas with width extended by the maximum object width plus 1.
2. **Object Painting and Extension:** Paint each object onto the canvas.  Then, fill the area to the right of each object with '8's, effectively extending it to the edge of the canvas. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        extension_width = width(obj) + 1
        extension = {(8, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + extension_width + 1)}
        O = paint(O, obj | extension)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Identify the background color (`bg`) and extract foreground objects (`objs`). Initialize an empty canvas (`O`) with the same shape as the input.
2. **Object Iteration and Extension:** Iterate over each object and calculate the width of its extension. Create a set of new cells (`extension`) representing the extension, filled with the color '8' and positioned to the right of the object.
3. **Painting:** Paint both the original object (`obj`) and its extension (`extension`) onto the canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    shifted = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(shift(obj, (0,width(obj) + 1)) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)))
    extensions = merge(recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + width(obj) + 2)}) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True))
    O = paint(shifted, extensions)
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions, identify the background color and extract foreground objects.
2. **Shifting Objects:** Shift each object to the right by a distance equal to its width plus 1, creating space for the extension.
3. **Generating Extensions:** For each object, create a rectangular extension filled with the color '8'. The width of the extension is equal to the object's width plus 1.
4. **Painting:** Paint the shifted objects onto a blank canvas and then paint the generated extensions on top, overwriting any overlapping background.


Each of these program versions utilizes different function combinations and logic to achieve the desired transformation.
