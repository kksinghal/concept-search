## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves outlining objects of a specific color with the value '8'. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The single connected object formed by the digit '1' is outlined with '8'.

**Pair 1:**  All individual objects formed by the digit '1' are outlined with '8'. 

**Pair 2:** The transformation outlines the objects formed by both '1' digits. Notice that even though some objects are adjacent, the outline separates them.

**Pair 3:** Similar to Pair 2, this transformation outlines objects of '1' with '8', maintaining separation even when adjacent.


## Code Generation:

Based on the analysis, the core logic is to:

1. **Identify target objects:** Locate all objects formed by the least common color in the grid.
2. **Outline each object:** For every identified object, replace the surrounding cells with the value '8'.
3. **Combine and paint:** Merge all outlined objects back onto the original grid.


Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_objects = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Find all objects
  least_color = leastcolor(I) # Find the least common color in the grid
  filtered_objects = colorfilter(target_objects, least_color) # Filter for objects with the least common color
  outlined_objects = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, outbox(obj)), filtered_objects) # Outline each object
  O = paint(I, merge(outlined_objects)) # Combine and paint outlines onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_objects = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid (`I`) using the `objects` function.
2. **`least_color = leastcolor(I)`:**  Determines the least common color within the input grid using the `leastcolor` function.
3. **`filtered_objects = colorfilter(target_objects, least_color)`:** Isolates objects formed by the least common color using the `colorfilter` function.
4. **`outlined_objects = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, outbox(obj)), filtered_objects)`:**  This is where the outlining happens. It iterates through each object in `filtered_objects` and applies a lambda function:
   - `outbox(obj)`: Calculates the outer boundary of the current object.
   - `recolor(EIGHT, ...)`:  Replaces the cells within the boundary with the value '8', effectively outlining the object.
5. **`O = paint(I, merge(outlined_objects))`:** Merges all outlined objects and paints them onto the original input grid (`I`) using the `paint` function.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)  # Find the least common color
  object_indices = ofcolor(I, target_color)  # Get indices of cells with target color
  outline_indices = mfilter(object_indices, lambda loc: any(n not in object_indices for n in neighbors(loc)))  # Find outline
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, outline_indices)  # Fill outline indices with '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = leastcolor(I)`:** Identifies the least common color in the input grid.
2. **`object_indices = ofcolor(I, target_color)`:**  Gets the indices of all cells containing the target color.
3. **`outline_indices = mfilter(...)`:** This is the outline detection part:
   - It iterates over each cell index in `object_indices`.
   - For each cell, it checks if any of its neighboring cells (using `neighbors(loc)`) are NOT part of `object_indices`.
   - If so, the current cell is on the outline and its index is included.
4. **`O = fill(I, EIGHT, outline_indices)`:**  Fills the identified outline indices with the value '8' on the input grid.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  least_color = leastcolor(I)  # Find the least common color
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract all objects
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == least_color) # Find the object with the least common color
  outline = outbox(target_obj) # Find the outbox of the object
  O = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, outline)) # Paint the outline on the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`least_color = leastcolor(I)`:**  Determines the least common color in the input grid.
2. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extracts all distinct objects from the grid.
3. **`target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == least_color)`:**  Finds the specific object that has the least common color.
4. **`outline = outbox(target_obj)`:**  Calculates the outer boundary (outbox) of the target object.
5. **`O = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, outline))`:** Paints the outline onto the original grid using the value '8'. 

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  def outline_obj(obj):
    if color(obj) == target_color:
      return recolor(EIGHT, outbox(obj))
    else:
      return obj
  outlined_objects = apply(outline_obj, objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(outlined_objects))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = leastcolor(I)`:**  Finds the least common color.
2. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extracts all objects from the grid.
3. **`def outline_obj(obj): ...`:** Defines a helper function `outline_obj` to process each object:
    - If the object's color matches the `target_color`, it outlines the object using `recolor(EIGHT, outbox(obj))`.
    - Otherwise, it returns the object unchanged.
4. **`outlined_objects = apply(outline_obj, objs)`:** Applies the `outline_obj` function to each object in `objs`, effectively outlining only the target objects.
5. **`O = paint(I, merge(outlined_objects))`:** Merges the processed objects (outlined or unchanged) and paints them onto the input grid.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def outline_if_least(obj):
    return recolor(EIGHT, outbox(obj)) if color(obj) == leastcolor(I) else obj
  outlined_objects = apply(outline_if_least, objects(I, True, False, True))
  return paint(I, merge(outlined_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def outline_if_least(obj): ...`:** Defines a helper function `outline_if_least` that outlines an object with '8' if its color matches the least common color in the grid (`leastcolor(I)`), otherwise, it returns the object unchanged.
2. **`outlined_objects = apply(outline_if_least, objects(I, True, False, True))`:** Applies the `outline_if_least` function to every object extracted from the grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
3. **`return paint(I, merge(outlined_objects))`:**  Combines the processed objects and paints them onto the original grid.


These five program versions demonstrate various approaches to achieve the same transformation using the DSL. They showcase different ways to identify target objects, calculate outlines, and manipulate grid data.
