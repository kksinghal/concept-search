## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' (excluding the background color '9') and extending them leftwards by filling with the digit '8'. The extension should occur only within the boundaries of the object and should replace existing '9's. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input 0:** The '1' object spans from column 2 to column 4 and from column 7 to column 9. The transformation fills these columns with '8' from the leftmost '1' in each row until it reaches the left boundary of the object or encounters a digit other than '9'.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, the '1' objects are extended leftwards with '8'. Note that the extension stops at the object boundaries, even if there are '9's present within other objects.

**Input 2 & 3:** The same logic applies. The '1' objects, regardless of their shape or position, are extended leftwards with '8', replacing any '9's within the object boundary. 


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify the object formed by '1's (excluding background)
  obj = next(iter(objects(I, True, False, True)))
  
  # Get indices of '1's within the object
  one_indices = frozenset(loc for v, loc in obj if v == 1) 

  # Function to fill leftwards within the object
  def fill_left(i, j):
    # Only fill if current cell is within object and is a '9'
    if (1, (i, j)) in obj and index(I, (i, j)) == 9:
      return frozenset((8, (i, k)) for k in range(j-1, -1, -1) if (1, (i, k)) in obj)
    else:
      return frozenset()

  # Apply fill_left to all '1' indices and merge the results
  filled_cells = merge(apply(lambda loc: fill_left(*loc), one_indices))
  
  # Paint the filled cells onto the original grid
  return paint(I, filled_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies objects formed by '1's, excluding the background. `next(iter(...))` extracts the first (and likely only) object.
2. **Get '1' indices:** `one_indices` stores the locations of all '1' cells within the object.
3. **Fill leftwards:** `fill_left(i, j)` checks if a cell is within the object and contains '9'. If so, it generates a set of cells to be filled with '8' leftwards until the object boundary.
4. **Apply and merge:** `apply` applies `fill_left` to all '1' indices, and `merge` combines the resulting sets of filled cells.
5. **Paint the grid:** `paint` updates the original grid by painting the `filled_cells` with '8'.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next(iter(objects(I, True, False, True)))
  one_indices = toindices(frozenset((1, loc) for v, loc in obj if v == 1))
  def fill_condition(i, j):
    return (8, (i, j)) if (1, (i, j)) in obj and index(I, (i, j)) == 9 else None
  filled_cells = mfilter(prapply(fill_condition, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))), lambda x: x is not None)
  return paint(I, filled_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify object and '1' indices:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Fill condition:** `fill_condition(i, j)` checks if a cell belongs to the object and contains '9', returning the cell with '8' if true, else None.
3. **Apply, filter, and merge:** `prapply` applies `fill_condition` to all grid cells. `mfilter` filters out None values and merges the remaining cells into a single set.
4. **Paint the grid:** Similar to Version 1.


**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next(iter(objects(I, True, False, True)))
  filled_cells = frozenset()
  for v, (i, j) in obj:
    if v == 1:
      k = j - 1
      while k >= 0 and (1, (i, k)) in obj and index(I, (i, k)) == 9:
        filled_cells = insert((8, (i, k)), filled_cells)
        k -= 1
  return paint(I, filled_cells) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate and fill:** The code iterates through each cell of the object. If a '1' is encountered, it iterates leftwards, filling with '8' until it hits the object boundary or a digit other than '9'.
3. **Paint the grid:** Similar to Version 1.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next(iter(objects(I, True, False, True)))
  fill_ranges = {}
  for v, (i, j) in obj:
    if v == 1:
      start = j
      while start > 0 and (1, (i, start-1)) in obj:
        start -= 1
      fill_ranges[(i, j)] = start
  filled_cells = frozenset((8, (i, k)) for (i, j), start in fill_ranges.items() for k in range(start, j))
  return paint(I, filled_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Calculate fill ranges:** For each '1', the code finds the starting column for filling '8' and stores it in `fill_ranges`.
3. **Generate filled cells:** Based on `fill_ranges`, it generates a set of cells to be filled with '8'.
4. **Paint the grid:** Similar to Version 1.


**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next(iter(objects(I, True, False, True)))
  mirrored_I = hmirror(I)
  def fill_condition(i, j):
    return 8 if (1, (i, j)) in obj and mirrored_I[i][j] == 9 else I[i][j]
  return hmirror(tuple(tuple(fill_condition(i, j) for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Mirror the grid:**  `hmirror(I)` creates a horizontally mirrored copy of the input grid.
3. **Fill condition:** `fill_condition(i, j)` checks if a cell is in the object and its mirrored counterpart contains '9'. If so, it fills with '8'; otherwise, it retains the original value.
4. **Apply, mirror, and return:** The code applies `fill_condition` to all grid cells, mirrors the resulting grid back to its original orientation, and returns it. 

Each version implements the same logic with different DSL function combinations and approaches, showcasing the diversity and flexibility of the DSL.
