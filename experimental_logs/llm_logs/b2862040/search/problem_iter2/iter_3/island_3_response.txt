## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and drawing a bounding box around them, but with an offset of one cell outwards. The bounding box is filled with the value '8', and the original object remains untouched.

**Example:**

**Input:**
```
9 9 1 9 9 
9 1 1 1 9
9 1 9 1 9 
9 9 1 9 9 
9 9 9 9 9 
```

**Output:**
```
9 9 8 9 9 9 9
9 8 8 8 9 9 9
9 8 1 8 9 9 9
9 8 8 8 9 9 9
9 9 8 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 9
```

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))  # Create canvas with 2-cell border
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    O = fill(O, row, {(i + 1, j + 1) for j in range(len(row))})  # Place input onto canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, 8, shift(outbox(toindices(obj)), (1, 1)))  # Draw shifted outbox
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A canvas is created with dimensions two cells larger in both height and width than the input grid. This provides a border for the bounding boxes.
2. **Input Placement:** The input grid is copied onto the center of the created canvas.
3. **Object Iteration:** The program iterates through each object identified in the input grid.
4. **Shifted Outbox:** For each object, the `outbox` function calculates the outer boundary indices. These indices are then shifted by (1,1) to draw the box one cell outwards. Finally, the `fill` function draws the box on the canvas with the value '8'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = hconcat((canvas(bg, (height(I), 1)), I, canvas(bg, (height(I), 1))))  # Pad sides
  O = vconcat((canvas(bg, (1, width(O))), O, canvas(bg, (1, width(O)))))  # Pad top/bottom
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, 8, shift(outbox(toindices(obj)), (1, 1)))  # Draw shifted outbox
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Padding:** This version pads the input grid with a single-cell border on all sides using `hconcat` and `vconcat` instead of creating a larger canvas.
2. **Object Iteration & Shifted Outbox:**  The remaining steps are identical to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2)) # Create canvas with border
  for i, j in prapply(lambda i, j: (i + 1, j + 1), range(height(I)), range(width(I))):
    O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, j)}) # Place input on canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, 8, shift(delta(backdrop(obj)), (1, 1))) # Draw shifted delta
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Placement:** Similar to Version 1, a canvas is created with a border, and the input grid is placed onto it. However, `prapply` and `index` are used for a more generalized placement.
2. **Shifted Delta:** Instead of using `outbox`, this version utilizes `delta` and `backdrop` functions. The `backdrop` function obtains indices within the object's bounding box, and `delta` selects the indices on the box's perimeter. These indices are then shifted and filled.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    shifted_box = shift(box(toindices(obj)), (1, 1))  # Calculate shifted box
    O = fill(O, 8, sfilter(shifted_box, lambda ij: 0 <= ij[0] < height(I) and 0 <= ij[1] < width(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Drawing:** This version directly modifies the input grid.
2. **Shifted Box and In-Bounds Filtering:** For each object, `box` function directly calculates the bounding box indices, which are then shifted. The `sfilter` function is used to ensure only indices within the original grid's bounds are filled with '8'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for corner in corners(obj):
      O = fill(O, 8, neighbors(add(corner, (1, 1))))  # Fill neighbors of shifted corners
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Drawing and Corner Iteration:** This version also directly modifies the input grid. It iterates over each object's corners using the `corners` function.
2. **Neighbor Filling:**  For each corner, it calculates the neighbor indices after shifting the corner by (1, 1). These neighbor indices are then filled with '8'.

These five versions offer different approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL. Each version attempts to strike a balance between code conciseness and computational efficiency.
