## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects of color '1' to the left with color '8' until they encounter a non-background, non-'1' color. This extension occurs within the bounding box of the object. Here's a breakdown of the transformation for each example:

**Input 0:** The object at the center extends leftward, filling the background cells with '8' until it reaches the '9's on its left.

**Input 1:** The three objects of color '1' are extended leftwards. The top and bottom objects extend fully to the edge, while the middle object stops at the other '1' color.

**Input 2:** This input demonstrates that the extension occurs within the bounding box of each object. The bottom leftmost object doesn't extend past the column of the object above it.

**Input 3:** Similar to the previous examples, the extension happens within the object's bounding box and stops at non-background, non-'1' colors.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Identify objects in the grid
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  def extend_left(obj):
    if color(obj) == target_color: # Focus on target color objects
      min_j = leftmost(obj) # Find leftmost column of the object
      for i, j in toindices(obj): # Iterate through object cells
        for k in range(j-1, min_j - 1, -1): # Extend leftward within bounding box
          if index(I, (i, k)) != 9 and index(I, (i, k)) != target_color: # Stop at non-background, non-target
            break
          I = fill(I, extension_color, {(i, k)}) # Fill with extension color
    return obj
  extended_objs = frozenset(extend_left(obj) for obj in objs) # Apply extension to all objects
  O = paint(I, extended_objs) # Paint extended objects onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the target color objects and extends leftward within the object's bounding box. It fills encountered background cells with the extension color until it hits a non-background, non-target color.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid with background
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == target_color:
      for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I)): # Iterate through columns from object's leftmost
        extension_area = frozenset((i, k) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for k in range(j-1, leftmost(obj)-1, -1) if index(I, (i, k)) == 9)
        if len(extension_area) > 0:
          O = fill(O, extension_color, extension_area)
        O = paint(O, obj) # Paint original object on the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through columns from the object's leftmost point. For each column, it identifies potential extension areas within the object's bounding box. If an extension area exists, it fills it with the extension color before painting the original object onto the grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I)) # Start with a blank canvas
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == target_color:
      left_border = {(i, leftmost(obj) - 1) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)} # Define object's left border
      extension_area = backdrop(obj) & hfrontier((0, leftmost(obj) - 1)) # Intersection of backdrop and left frontier
      for i, j in extension_area:
        if index(I, (i, j)) != target_color and index(I, (i,j)) != 9:
          extension_area -= {(i, k) for k in range(j, leftmost(obj))} # Remove cells if non-target, non-background encountered
          break
      O = fill(O, extension_color, extension_area) # Fill the extension area
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the original object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Version 3 focuses on identifying the potential extension area using the intersection of the object's backdrop and a leftward horizontal frontier. It then refines the extension area by removing cells blocked by non-target, non-background colors.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I.copy() # Create a copy of the input grid
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == target_color:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # Iterate through object rows
        j = leftmost(obj) - 1 # Start from the cell left to the object
        while j >= 0 and index(I, (i, j)) in (9, target_color): # Extend left while background or target color
          O = fill(O, extension_color, {(i, j)}) # Fill with extension color
          j -= 1 # Move to the next left cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly modifies a copy of the input grid. It iterates through each row of the target color objects and extends leftward using a while loop. The loop continues as long as it encounters background or target color cells, filling them with the extension color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I)) # Initialize output with background
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == target_color:
      extension_indices = set()
      for i, j in toindices(obj): # Iterate through object cells
        k = j - 1 
        while k >= 0 and index(I, (i, k)) == 9: # Extend left while background
          extension_indices.add((i, k))
          k -= 1
      O = fill(O, extension_color, frozenset(extension_indices)) # Fill all identified extension indices
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Version 5 first identifies all the extension indices for each target color object using a while loop that traverses leftward as long as it encounters background cells. It then fills all these indices with the extension color before painting the original object.


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
