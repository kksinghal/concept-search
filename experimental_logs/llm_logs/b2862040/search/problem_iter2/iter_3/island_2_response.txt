## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the smallest object:** The program first identifies the smallest object in the input grid, excluding the background color (which is usually the most frequent color).
2. **Expand the object:** The object is then expanded horizontally by adding two columns to the right and one to the left. 
3. **Recolor the expansion:** The newly added cells are recolored with the digit '8'.
4. **Paint the expanded object:** Finally, the expanded and recolored object is painted back onto the input grid, replacing its original form.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") in the provided DSL, each achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  target_obj = argmin(objects(I, True, False, True), size)
  expanded_indices = frozenset((i,j) for i in range(uppermost(target_obj), lowermost(target_obj)+1) for j in range(leftmost(target_obj)-1, rightmost(target_obj)+2))
  expanded_obj = toobject(expanded_indices, I)
  O = paint(cover(I, target_obj), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `argmin(objects(I, True, False, True), size)`: This line identifies the smallest object in the grid `I`. It utilizes `objects` to get all objects (excluding background), then finds the smallest using `argmin` with `size` as the comparison key.
* `expanded_indices`: We create a set of indices representing the expanded object by iterating through rows and columns based on the original object's boundaries.
* `toobject`:  This function converts the expanded indices to an object using color information from the original grid.
* `paint(cover(I, target_obj), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_obj))`: This paints the expanded object (recolored with `EIGHT`) onto a copy of the input grid where the original object is removed using `cover`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  target_obj = argmin(objs, lambda obj: width(obj) * height(obj))
  O = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toobject(outbox(target_obj) - outbox(shift(target_obj, (0, -2))), I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `argmin(objs, lambda obj: width(obj) * height(obj))`: Finds the smallest object based on the product of its width and height.
* `outbox(target_obj) - outbox(shift(target_obj, (0, -2)))`:  Calculates the indices to be expanded as the difference between the outer box of the original object and a shifted version of the outer box.
* The rest is similar to Version 1, recoloring and painting the expanded area. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  for obj in sorted(objects(I, True, False, True), key=size):
    return paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(EIGHT, toobject(backdrop(shift(obj, (-1, -1))), I)))
```

**Explanation:**

* `sorted(objects(I, True, False, True), key=size)`:  Sorts the objects by size.
* `for obj in ... return ...`:  Iterates through the sorted objects and directly returns the transformation result for the first (smallest) object.
* `backdrop(shift(obj, (-1, -1)))`: Calculates the indices of the expanded object by shifting the original object one cell up and left, and then taking its backdrop.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  min_obj = min(objects(I, True, False, True), key=lambda o: len(o))
  return paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toobject(
      frozenset((i, j + k) for i, j in toindices(min_obj) for k in (-1, 0, 1, 2)), 
      I
  )))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version finds the smallest object similarly to previous versions.
* `frozenset((i, j + k) for i, j in toindices(min_obj) for k in (-1, 0, 1, 2))`: This line directly calculates the indices for the expansion by adding offsets (-1, 0, 1, 2) to the column index of each cell in the smallest object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  min_obj = min(objects(I, True, False, True), key=len)
  shifted_obj = shift(min_obj, (0, -1))
  expansion = difference(
      mapply(lambda idx: frozenset({(idx[0], idx[1] + k) for k in range(-1, 3)}), toindices(min_obj)), 
      toindices(shifted_obj)
  )
  return paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toobject(expansion, I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

* `min(objects(I, True, False, True), key=len)`: Finds the smallest object.
* `shifted_obj`: Creates a copy of the object shifted one cell to the left.
* `expansion`:  Calculates the indices for expansion by:
    - Creating a larger expansion area around each cell of the original object using `mapply` and a `lambda` function.
    -  Removing the indices of the shifted object from this larger expansion area using `difference`. 
* This approach avoids explicitly calculating the object's boundaries and relies on set operations for expansion. 

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing diversity in the code generation.
