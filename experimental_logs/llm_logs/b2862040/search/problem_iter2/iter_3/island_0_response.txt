## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color) in the input grid and extending them to the right. The extension fills the space until it encounters another object or the edge of the grid.  The extended area is filled with color '8'.

**Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The single '1' object is extended to the right, filling the space with '8' until reaching the existing '1's or the grid's edge.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, '1' objects are extended rightwards, filling with '8'. Notice the extension stops upon encountering another '1' object or the grid's edge.
* **Input_2:**  The transformation logic remains consistent.
* **Input_3:** Again, '1' objects are extended rightward, highlighting that the extension occurs for all identified objects within the grid. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I) 
  return hconcat(I, tuple(tuple(8 if any(v != bg for v in I[i][:j]) else bg for j in range(width(I))) 
                            for i in range(height(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Determines the background color of the input grid.
2. **`hconcat(I, ...)`:** Horizontally concatenates the input grid (`I`) with a new grid generated by the subsequent expression.
3. **`tuple(tuple(...) for i in range(height(I)))`:**  Iterates through each row of the input grid.
4. **`8 if any(v != bg for v in I[i][:j]) else bg for j in range(width(I))`:** For each cell in the row, checks if any cell to the left in the same row is not the background color. If true, it fills the cell with '8', otherwise, it keeps the background color. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  def right_expand(obj):
    return frozenset((color(obj), (i, j + k)) for i, j in toindices(obj)
                   for k in range(width(I) - j) if k == 0 or I[i][j + k] == mostcolor(I))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(right_expand, objects(I, T, F, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_expand(obj)`:** Defines a function that takes an object as input and returns a new object extended to the right. It iterates through each cell of the object and extends it rightward until it hits a non-background color or the edge of the grid.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`apply(right_expand, ...)`:** Applies the `right_expand` function to each identified object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the expanded objects into a single set of cells.
5. **`paint(canvas(...), ...)`:**  Paints the merged, expanded objects onto a blank canvas with the input grid's dimensions, filled with the background color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, (height(I), 2 * width(I)))
  return tuple(tuple(I[i][j] if j < width(I) else (8 if any(I[i][k] != bg for k in range(j)) else bg) 
                   for j in range(2 * width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Determines the background color.
2. **`new_grid = canvas(bg, (height(I), 2 * width(I)))`:** Creates a new grid twice the width of the input grid, filled with the background color.
3. **`tuple(tuple(...) for i in range(height(I)))`:**  Iterates through each row.
4. **`I[i][j] if j < width(I) else ... for j in range(2 * width(I))`:** Copies the input grid to the left half of the new grid. For the right half, it fills with '8' if any cell to the left in the same row is not the background, otherwise, keeps the background color.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def extend_right(row):
    extended = list(row)
    for j in range(len(row)):
      if extended[j] != mostcolor(I):
        extended[j+1:] = [8] * (len(row) - j - 1) 
        break
    return tuple(extended)
  return tuple(extend_right(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **`extend_right(row)`:** Defines a function to extend a row rightward. It iterates through each cell, and upon encountering a non-background color, fills the remaining cells to the right with '8'.
2. **`tuple(extend_right(row) for row in I)`:** Applies the `extend_right` function to each row of the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def right_fill(i, j):
    return 8 if any(I[i][k] != mostcolor(I) for k in range(j)) else mostcolor(I)
  return tuple(tuple(right_fill(i, j) for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_fill(i, j)`:** Defines a function that takes row and column indices and returns '8' if any cell to the left in the same row is not the background color, otherwise, returns the background color.
2. **`tuple(tuple(...) for i in range(height(I)))`:**  Iterates through each row and column, applying the `right_fill` function to determine the output grid's cell values.


These five program versions showcase different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the desired rightward object extension. Each version utilizes the DSL's capabilities for grid manipulation, color identification, and conditional logic to accurately perform the transformation.
