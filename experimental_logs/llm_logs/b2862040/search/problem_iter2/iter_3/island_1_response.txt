## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve the following steps for each input-output pair:

1. **Identify Non-Background Objects:** Identify all objects within the input grid that are not part of the background (most common color).
2. **Extend Objects Rightwards:** Extend each identified object by one cell to the right, but only if the cell to the right is within the grid's boundaries and is currently a background cell.
3. **Recolor Extended Objects:** Change the color of all cells within the extended objects to '8'.
4. **Reconstruct Grid:** Paint the extended and recolored objects onto a blank canvas (filled with the original background color) of the same size as the input grid.

## Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify background color
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Get non-background objects
  extended_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    extended_obj = set(obj)  # Create a copy of the object
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg:  # Check for valid rightward extension
        extended_obj.add((8, (i, j + 1)))  # Extend and recolor
    extended_objs.add(frozenset(extended_obj))  # Add extended object to the set
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), extended_objs)  # Paint on a new canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each non-background object, creates a copy, and extends the copy to the right if possible. The extended cell is immediately recolored to '8'. Finally, all extended objects are painted onto a new canvas.

## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  extended_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(combine(toindices(obj), {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg}), I), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), recolor(8, extended_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages functional programming aspects of the DSL. It uses `mapply` to apply a lambda function to each object. This lambda function combines the original object's indices with the indices of its rightward extension (if possible) and uses `toobject` to recreate the extended object from these indices. Finally, it recolors all extended objects to '8' and paints them.

## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  extended_objs = frozenset(frozenset((8, (i, j)) if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg else (c, (i, j)) for c, (i, j) in obj) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), extended_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested set comprehensions for a more compact representation. It directly modifies the object during iteration by conditionally including the rightward extension (and recoloring to '8'). 

## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  shifted_grid = hconcat(I, canvas(bg, (height(I), 1))) # Add a background column to the right
  objs = objects(shifted_grid, True, False, True)
  trimmed_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: loc[1] < width(I)), shifted_grid), objs)
  recolored_objs = recolor(8, trimmed_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the extension logic by first adding a temporary background column to the right of the input grid.  Then, it identifies objects on this extended grid, trims them back to the original grid size, recolors them, and paints them onto the canvas.

## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  def extend_right(obj):
    return toobject(combine(toindices(obj), {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg}), I)
  extended_objs = frozenset(map(extend_right, objs))
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), recolor(8, extended_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a separate function `extend_right` for readability.  It uses `map` to apply this function to each object and then proceeds with recoloring and painting.
