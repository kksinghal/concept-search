## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects of a specific color (target_color = 1) leftward on the grid. The extension is done using a different color (extension_color = 8) and stops upon encountering any obstacle (any color different from the target_color and the background color, which is assumed to be 9).

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** 
- The three 1-colored objects are extended leftward with color 8. 
- The top and bottom objects extend until they hit the grid boundary. 
- The middle object extends until it hits the 9-colored wall.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, but with more objects and obstacles.
- Note how the extension goes under the bottom-right object, indicating the extension occurs before considering object overlap.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
- This example showcases that extension can handle objects spanning multiple rows.

**Input_3 - Output_3:**
-  Further demonstrates the extension logic with various object shapes and positions.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using different DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1 (Inspired by Program_B's row-wise iteration and Program_A's object identification):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid with background color
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Get all objects in the input grid (excluding background)
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == target_color: # Only process target_color objects
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # Iterate through rows of the object
        for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate leftward from the object's left edge
          if index(I, (i, j)) != target_color and index(I, (i,j)) != 9: # Stop at non-target and non-background colors
            break
          O = fill(O, extension_color, {(i, j)}) # Fill the output grid with extension_color
        O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the original object onto the output grid 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) filled with the background color and identifies all objects (`objs`) in the input grid.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object (`obj`) in `objs`.
3. **Color Check:** Checks if the current object's color matches the `target_color`.
4. **Row Iteration:**  Iterates through each row (`i`) of the target object.
5. **Leftward Extension:** For each row, iterates leftward from the object's left edge (`j`) and fills the output grid with `extension_color` until it hits a non-target and non-background color.
6. **Object Painting:** After extending each row, paints the original object onto the output grid to ensure it's not overwritten. 

**Program Version 2 (Utilizing `hfrontier` and `intersection` for extension area):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  def extend_left(obj):
    if color(obj) == target_color:
      left_border = hfrontier((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj) - 1))
      extension_area = intersection(backdrop(obj), left_border)
      for (i, j) in extension_area:
        if index(I, (i, j)) != target_color and index(I, (i,j)) != 9:
          extension_area -= {(i, k) for k in range(j, leftmost(obj))}
          break
      return recolor(extension_color, toobject(extension_area, I))
    return obj
  extended_objs = frozenset(extend_left(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(I, extended_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to version 1, identifies objects and defines target/extension colors.
2. **`extend_left` Function:**  This function takes an object as input and extends it leftward if it's the target color.
   - `left_border`: Calculates the left frontier of the object.
   - `extension_area`:  Finds the intersection between the object's backdrop and the left border, representing the potential extension area.
   - **Obstacle Check:** Iterates through the `extension_area` and stops upon encountering a non-target and non-background color. The area to the right of the obstacle is removed from `extension_area`.
   - **Recoloring:** Recolors the final `extension_area` with the `extension_color`.
3. **Object Extension:** Applies `extend_left` to each object in `objs`.
4. **Painting:**  Paints the extended objects onto the original grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 3 (Emphasizing row-wise processing):** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I)) 
  h, w = shape(I)
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  for i in range(h):
    current_obj_start = None
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == target_color and current_obj_start is None:
        current_obj_start = j
      elif current_obj_start is not None and (I[i][j] != target_color and I[i][j] != 9):
        O = fill(O, extension_color, {(i, k) for k in range(current_obj_start - 1, j)})
        current_obj_start = None
    if current_obj_start is not None:
      O = fill(O, extension_color, {(i, k) for k in range(current_obj_start - 1, -1, -1)})
  O = paint(O, asobject(I)) 
  return O
```

 **Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a canvas and defines colors.
2. **Row Iteration:** Iterates through each row of the input grid.
3. **Object Tracking:** Tracks the starting column (`current_obj_start`) of potential `target_color` objects within each row.
4. **Extension Logic:** When an obstacle is encountered (`I[i][j] != target_color and I[i][j] != 9`), fills the output grid from the previous column of the object start (`current_obj_start - 1`) to the current column (`j`) with `extension_color`.
5. **End-of-Row Handling:**  If an object continues to the edge, extends it to the leftmost boundary.
6. **Final Painting:** Paints the original input onto the output to preserve the target objects.


**Program Version 4 (Leveraging object properties for targeted extension):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  def extend_left(obj):
    if color(obj) == target_color:
      extension = frozenset((extension_color, (i, j)) for i, j in product(range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1), range(leftmost(obj) - 1, -1, -1)) if index(I, (i, j)) == 9)
      return obj | extension
    return obj
  extended_objects = frozenset(extend_left(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), extended_objects)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **`extend_left` Function:**
   - Uses `product` to generate all potential extension coordinates within the object's bounding box, extending leftward.
   - Filters these coordinates using `index(I, (i, j)) == 9` to only include background cells.
   - Combines the original object with the re-colored extension.
3. **Object Extension:** Applies `extend_left` to all objects.
4. **Painting and Covering:**  Covers the original objects on the grid and then paints the extended objects.

**Program Version 5 (Direct grid manipulation with conditional filling):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I)) 
  h, w = shape(I)
  target_color = 1
  extension_color = 8
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == target_color:
        for k in range(j - 1, -1, -1):
          if I[i][k] != target_color and I[i][k] != 9: 
            break
          O[i][k] = extension_color
  O = paint(O, asobject(I)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a canvas and defines colors.
2. **Grid Iteration:**  Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Target Color Check:**  If a cell contains `target_color`, initiates leftward extension.
4. **Leftward Extension:**  Fills the corresponding cells in the output grid (`O`) with `extension_color` until a non-target, non-background color is found.
5. **Object Preservation:**  Finally, paints the original objects from the input grid onto the output to prevent overwriting.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same grid transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diverse problem-solving capabilities within the DSL.
