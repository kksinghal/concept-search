## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves the following steps:

1. **Identify and Separate Objects:** The input grid is analyzed to identify distinct objects based on connected cells with the same value (excluding the background color 9).
2. **Color Transformation:** All objects are recolored to the value 8.
3. **Horizontal Extension:** Each object is extended horizontally to the right by adding a single cell with the value 8. The extension only occurs if the added cell falls within the grid boundaries.
4. **Object Placement:** The transformed objects are placed back onto a blank canvas filled with the background color 9. The placement might involve shifting or aligning objects based on their relative positions in the input grid.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), objs)
    extended_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(combine(toindices(obj), {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < width(I) - 1}), I), recolored_objs)
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), extended_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identify all objects in the input grid `I`, considering only directly connected cells and excluding the background.
2. **`recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), objs)`**: Recolor all identified objects to have the value 8.
3. **`extended_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(combine(toindices(obj), {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < width(I) - 1}), I), recolored_objs)`**: Extend each object horizontally by one cell to the right, ensuring the extension stays within the grid boundaries.
4. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), extended_objs)`**: Create a new canvas filled with the background color and paint the transformed objects onto it.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      shifted_obj.add((8, (i, j)))
      if j < width(I) - 1:
        shifted_obj.add((8, (i, j+1)))
    shifted_objs.add(frozenset(shifted_obj))
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`**: Identify the background color of the input grid.
2. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`**: Extract all objects from the input grid, considering connected cells with the same value and excluding the background.
3. **Loop through each object:** Iterate through each object and its cells.
4. **`shifted_obj.add((8, (i, j)))`**: Add the current cell to the `shifted_obj` with color 8.
5. **`if j < width(I) - 1: shifted_obj.add((8, (i, j+1)))`**: If the current cell is not on the right edge, add a cell to its right with color 8, effectively extending the object horizontally.
6. **`shifted_objs.add(frozenset(shifted_obj))`**: Add the modified object to the set of shifted objects.
7. **`O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shifted_objs)`**: Create a canvas with the input grid's shape and background color, then paint the shifted objects onto it.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    extended_objs = mapply(
        lambda obj: toobject(
            mpapply(
                lambda loc: combine(initset(loc), {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)} if loc[1] < width(I) - 1 else initset(loc)),
                toindices(obj)
            ),
            I
        ),
        objs
    )
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(8, extended_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extract objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`extended_objs = ...`**: Extend each object horizontally:
    - For each object, convert it to indices.
    - For each index `(i, j)`:
        - Create a set containing the index itself.
        - If `j` is within the grid's width, add `(i, j + 1)` to the set (extend right).
        - Merge all sets into a single set of indices representing the extended object.
    - Convert the extended indices back to an object using `toobject`.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(8, extended_objs))`**: Create a canvas, recolor all extended objects to 8, and paint them onto the canvas.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  extended_grid = []
  for row in I:
    new_row = list(row) + [bg]
    extended_grid.append(new_row)
  extended_grid = tuple(tuple(row) for row in extended_grid)
  O = replace(extended_grid, bg, 8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`**:  Find the background color of the input grid.
2. **`extended_grid = []`**: Initialize an empty list to build the extended grid.
3. **Loop through rows:** For each row in the input grid:
     - `new_row = list(row) + [bg]` Create a new row by copying the current row and adding a background color cell at the end.
     - `extended_grid.append(new_row)`: Append the new row to the `extended_grid`.
4. **`extended_grid = tuple(tuple(row) for row in extended_grid)`**: Convert the `extended_grid` to a tuple of tuples, representing a valid grid format.
5. **`O = replace(extended_grid, bg, 8)`**: Replace all occurrences of the background color in the `extended_grid` with the color 8.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(bg, (height(I), width(I) + 1))
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
      if j < width(I) - 1:
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`**: Identify the background color.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extract objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`O = canvas(bg, (height(I), width(I) + 1))`**: Create a canvas one column wider than the input grid, filled with the background color.
4. **Loop through objects and cells:** Iterate through each object and its cells.
5. **`O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})`**: Paint the current cell onto the canvas with color 8.
6. **`if j < width(I) - 1: O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j + 1))})`**: If the current cell is not on the right edge, paint a cell to its right with color 8 on the canvas.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation. They vary in their use of DSL functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version analyzes the input grid, identifies objects, extends them horizontally, and places them back onto a canvas to generate the output grid.
