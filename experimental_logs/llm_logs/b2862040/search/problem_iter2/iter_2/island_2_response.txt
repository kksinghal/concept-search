## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the object with the least frequent color in the input grid and expanding it horizontally. The expanded object then replaces the original object and is colored with the value 8. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The least frequent color is 1. 
- The object formed by color 1 is expanded horizontally by one cell on both sides.
- The expanded object replaces the original and is colored 8.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The least frequent color is 1.
- The object formed by color 1 is expanded horizontally by one cell on both sides.
- Notice the expansion wraps around the edges for the object spanning the right edge.
- The expanded object replaces the original and is colored 8.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- The least frequent color is 1.
- The object formed by color 1 is expanded horizontally by one cell on both sides.
- The expansion respects the grid boundaries and doesn't overflow.
- The expanded object replaces the original and is colored 8.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**

- The least frequent color is 1.
- The object formed by color 1 is expanded horizontally by one cell on both sides.
- The expansion respects the grid boundaries.
- The expanded object replaces the original and is colored 8.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" function, leveraging the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I) # Find the least frequent color
  target_object = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == target_color) # Extract object with target color
  expansion_indices = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0], loc[1] - 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}), toindices(target_object)) # Generate indices to expand horizontally
  expanded_object = toobject(combine(toindices(target_object), expansion_indices), I) # Create the expanded object
  O = paint(cover(I, target_object), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_object)) # Paint the expanded object on the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version leverages `mapply` to apply the expansion logic to each cell index of the target object.
- `frozenset` is used within the lambda function to ensure hashability. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  min_color = leastcolor(I) 
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, min_color)) 
  expanded_indices = frozenset((i, j + dj) for i, j in toindices(obj) for dj in (-1, 1)) # Generate expansion indices
  expanded_obj = toobject(combine(toindices(obj), expanded_indices), I)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_obj)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version simplifies the index generation using a nested loop within a set comprehension. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  target_object = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == target_color)
  left_expansion = shift(target_object, (0, -1))  # Expand left
  right_expansion = shift(target_object, (0, 1)) # Expand right
  expanded_object = merge((target_object, left_expansion, right_expansion)) # Merge to get expanded object
  O = paint(cover(I, target_object), recolor(EIGHT, toobject(expanded_object, I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses `shift` function for a more intuitive approach to generate the expanded object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  min_color = leastcolor(I)
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, min_color))
  expanded_obj = toobject(frozenset((i, j + dj) for i, j in toindices(obj) for dj in (-1, 0, 1)), I) # Generate and convert to object in one step
  O = paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version combines the object expansion and conversion to object steps for conciseness.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  min_color = leastcolor(I)
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, min_color))
  h = height(obj)
  expanded_obj = toobject(frozenset((i,j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), uppermost(obj)+h) for j in range(leftmost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+2)), I) # Explicitly define expansion range
  O = paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(EIGHT, expanded_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly calculates the range of indices for the expanded object based on its dimensions.
