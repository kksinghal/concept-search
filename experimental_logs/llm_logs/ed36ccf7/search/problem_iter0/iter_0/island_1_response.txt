## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be rotating the non-background color pixels in the image by 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Let's break down each example:

* **Input_0 to Output_0:**  The block of 9s rotates 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** The three 6s rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** The block of 9s rotates 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
* **Input_3 to Output_3:** The arrangement of 2s rotates 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program `Program_to_be_generated` that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset({shift(obj, (1,-1)) for obj in objs})
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify the objects formed by the non-background color pixels using `objects` with `univalued=True` (treating each color as a separate object), `diagonal=False` (considering only direct neighbors), and `without_bg=True` (excluding the background color).
2. **Shift Objects:** We shift each identified object by (1, -1) using `shift`. This specific offset achieves the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation within the grid.
3. **Paint Shifted Objects:** We first cover the original objects on the input grid using `cover` and then paint the shifted objects onto the covered grid using `paint`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = rot270(I) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate the Grid:** This version directly uses the `rot270` function to rotate the entire input grid 270 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color_to_rotate = leastcolor(I) if leastcolor(I) != mostcolor(I) else mostcolor(I)
  indices_to_rotate = ofcolor(I, color_to_rotate)
  shifted_indices = shift(indices_to_rotate, (1,-1))
  O = fill(cover(I, indices_to_rotate), color_to_rotate, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Color to Rotate:** We identify the non-background color using `leastcolor` and `mostcolor`. If `leastcolor` is the same as `mostcolor`, it means there's only one color present, so we rotate that.
2. **Find Indices:** We get the indices of all cells with the identified color using `ofcolor`.
3. **Shift and Fill:** We shift the identified indices by (1, -1) using `shift`. Then, we cover the original color on the input grid using `cover` and fill the shifted indices with the identified color using `fill`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = dmirror(rot90(dmirror(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mirror, Rotate, Mirror:** This version achieves the rotation by combining mirror and rotation operations. It first mirrors the grid diagonally (`dmirror`), then rotates it 90 degrees clockwise (`rot90`), and finally mirrors it diagonally again (`dmirror`). This sequence results in a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O[j][h-1-i] = I[i][j]
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** We create an empty canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with the background color using `canvas`.
2. **Iterate and Place:** We iterate through each cell of the input grid. If the cell doesn't contain the background color, we calculate its rotated position and place it on the output canvas. The new position is calculated as `(j, h-1-i)`, effectively performing a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version uses distinct logic and function combinations to achieve the desired result.
