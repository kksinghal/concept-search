## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on identifying areas with the value '3' in the input grid and consolidating them into a single rectangular block at the bottom left corner of the output grid. The remaining space in the output grid is filled with '0'. 

**Let's analyze each example:**

* **Input_0:** The input has scattered '3's. The output consolidates these into a 3x2 block at the bottom left.
* **Input_1:** The input has a vertical line of '3's. The output consolidates them into a 2x1 block at the bottom left.
* **Input_2:** The input has a 3x3 block of '3's. The output keeps the block as is but moves it to the bottom left.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find indices of value '3'
  x1 = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  
  # Calculate height and width of the consolidated block
  x2 = astuple(size(x1) // THREE if size(x1) % THREE == ZERO else size(x1) // THREE + ONE, THREE if size(x1) >= THREE else size(x1)) 
  
  # Create a canvas filled with '0' of the required output dimensions
  x3 = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) 
  
  # Fill the bottom left corner with '3' based on calculated dimensions
  O = fill(x3, THREE, product(interval(ZERO, x2[0], ONE), interval(ZERO, x2[1], ONE)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify target cells:** `ofcolor(I, THREE)` locates all indices in the grid 'I' with the value '3'.
2.  **Calculate block dimensions:**  `astuple(...)` calculates the height and width of the consolidated block. It divides the total count of '3' by 3 (desired width) and adjusts for remainders to get the height.
3.  **Create empty canvas:** `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` generates a grid of '0's with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  **Fill the block:** `fill(...)` paints a rectangle of '3's starting from the top left corner (0,0) with the calculated height and width.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Extract object with color '3'
  x1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == THREE) 
  
  # Calculate the new position for the top-left corner of the block
  x2 = subtract(astuple(len(I), ONE), shape(x1)) 
  
  # Move the extracted object to the bottom left
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(x1, x2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract target object:** `extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == THREE)` identifies and extracts the object formed by cells with the value '3'.
2.  **Calculate new position:**  `subtract(astuple(len(I), ONE), shape(x1))` calculates the new position for the object's top-left corner to place it at the bottom left of the grid.
3.  **Move and paint:** `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(x1, x2))` creates an empty canvas, moves the extracted object to the calculated position, and then paints it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find height and width of input
  x1 = shape(I) 
  
  # Create a canvas of zeros with input dimensions
  x2 = canvas(ZERO, x1)
  
  # Find the bounding box of '3's
  x3 = backdrop(ofcolor(I, THREE)) 
  
  # Calculate the starting position for the block
  x4 = subtract(subtract(x1, shape(x3)), (ONE, ZERO))
  
  # Fill the calculated region with '3's
  O = fill(x2, THREE, shift(x3, x4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Get grid dimensions:** `shape(I)` finds the height and width of the input grid.
2.  **Prepare canvas:**  `canvas(ZERO, x1)` creates a grid of '0's with the input grid dimensions.
3.  **Identify target area:** `backdrop(ofcolor(I, THREE))`  finds the smallest rectangular region encompassing all '3's in the input.
4.  **Calculate new position:** `subtract(subtract(x1, shape(x3)), (ONE, ZERO))` calculates the top-left corner position for the consolidated block, ensuring it sits at the bottom left.
5.  **Relocate and fill:** `fill(x2, THREE, shift(x3, x4))` shifts the target area to the calculated position and fills it with '3's on the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find the bottom-left corner of the input grid
  x1 = subtract(shape(I), UNITY) 
  
  # Find the bounding box of '3's and get its shape (height, width)
  x2 = shape(backdrop(ofcolor(I, THREE))) 
  
  # Calculate the offset to shift the '3' block
  x3 = subtract(x1, subtract(x2, UNITY)) 
  
  # Create an empty canvas 
  x4 = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  
  # Fill the bottom-left area with '3's based on the calculated offset and block size
  O = fill(x4, THREE, product(interval(x3[0], x1[0] + ONE, ONE), interval(ZERO, x2[1], ONE)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find bottom-left corner:** `subtract(shape(I), UNITY)` calculates the index of the bottom-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Get target block size:**  `shape(backdrop(ofcolor(I, THREE)))` determines the height and width of the rectangular area containing all '3's.
3.  **Calculate shift offset:** `subtract(x1, subtract(x2, UNITY))` computes the offset required to move the block to the bottom left.
4.  **Create canvas:**  `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` generates a grid of '0's with the same dimensions as the input grid.
5.  **Fill the shifted block:** `fill(...)` fills a block of '3's starting from the calculated offset with the determined height and width on the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Create an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid
  x1 = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) 
  
  # Find all objects in the input grid
  x2 = objects(I, T, F, F) 
  
  # Find the object containing the value '3'
  x3 = extract(x2, lambda obj: THREE in palette(obj)) 
  
  # Calculate the new position to move the object
  x4 = subtract(subtract(shape(I), shape(x3)), UNITY)
  
  # Paint the extracted object onto the canvas at the new position
  O = paint(x1, shift(x3, x4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Prepare canvas:** `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates an empty grid of '0's matching the input dimensions.
2.  **Identify all objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all distinct objects within the input grid.
3.  **Extract target object:**  `extract(x2, lambda obj: THREE in palette(obj))` locates the specific object containing the value '3'.
4.  **Calculate new position:** `subtract(subtract(shape(I), shape(x3)), UNITY)` determines the top-left corner position to move the extracted object to the bottom left.
5.  **Relocate and paint:**  `paint(x1, shift(x3, x4))` moves the target object to the new position and paints it onto the prepared canvas.
