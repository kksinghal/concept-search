## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in these examples involves identifying the object made of the digit '3' in the input grid and repainting it on a new canvas. The size of the canvas and the position of the repainted object vary based on the height of the input grid:

**Input_0 & Output_0:**

* **Canvas Size:** 10x10 (because input height is less than 15)
* **Object '3' Position:** Shifted down by 6 rows and right by 2 columns from its original position. Additionally, the object is duplicated and shifted one row down from the previous position.

**Input_1 & Output_1:**

* **Canvas Size:** 10x10 (because input height is less than 15)
* **Object '3' Position:**  Shifted down by 2 rows and right by 5 columns from its original position. 

**Input_2 & Output_2:**

* **Canvas Size:** 15x15 (because input height is greater than or equal to 15)
* **Object '3' Position:** Shifted down by 2 rows and right by 2 columns from its original position.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find indices of '3'
  threes = ofcolor(I, 3)
  
  # 2. Canvas size based on input height
  canvas_size = (10, 10) if height(I) < 15 else (15, 15)
  
  # 3. Create blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, canvas_size)
  
  # 4. Paint if '3' exists
  if threes:
    # Shift based on canvas size
    offset = (6, 2) if canvas_size == (10, 10) else (2, 2) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(threes, offset)))
    
    # Duplicate and shift if small canvas
    if canvas_size == (10, 10):
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(threes, add(offset, (1, 0))))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '3' Indices:** Locates all occurrences of '3' in the input grid.
2. **Determine Canvas Size:**  Sets the canvas size based on input height.
3. **Blank Canvas:** Creates a canvas filled with '0's.
4. **Conditional Painting:**  If '3' exists in the input:
   - Calculates the shift offset based on canvas size.
   - Paints the shifted '3' object onto the canvas.
   - If the canvas is small (10x10), duplicates the '3' object and paints it one row below. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find '3' object
  threes = ofcolor(I, 3)

  # 2. Define functions for size and offset
  get_canvas_size = lambda h: (10, 10) if h < 15 else (15, 15)
  get_offset = lambda s: (6, 2) if s == (10, 10) else (2, 2)

  # 3. Create canvas and paint '3'
  O = paint(canvas(0, get_canvas_size(height(I))), 
            recolor(3, shift(threes, get_offset(get_canvas_size(height(I))))))
  
  # 4. Duplicate on small canvas
  if height(I) < 15:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(threes, add(get_offset(get_canvas_size(height(I))), (1, 0)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '3' Object:**  Finds all '3' occurrences.
2. **Size & Offset Functions:**  Defines lambda functions to calculate the canvas size and the object shift offset dynamically based on the canvas size.
3. **Canvas Creation & Painting:** Creates the canvas and paints the shifted '3' object using the defined functions.
4. **Small Canvas Duplication:**  If the canvas is small, duplicates and paints the '3' object one row below.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1.  Canvas size and offset based on height
  canvas_size = (10, 10) if height(I) < 15 else (15, 15)
  offset = (6, 2) if canvas_size == (10, 10) else (2, 2)
  
  # 2. Create blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, canvas_size)

  # 3. Paint '3' object with conditional duplication
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(ofcolor(I, 3), offset)))
  if canvas_size == (10, 10):
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(ofcolor(I, 3), add(offset, (1, 0)))))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dynamic Size and Offset:** Calculates the canvas size and the shift offset based on the input height.
2. **Canvas Initialization:**  Creates a canvas filled with '0's.
3. **Conditional Painting:** 
   - Paints the shifted '3' object onto the canvas.
   - If the canvas is small, duplicates and paints the '3' object one row below.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Determine canvas size
  canvas_size = (10, 10) if height(I) < 15 else (15, 15)
  
  # 2. Define shift function based on canvas size
  shift_object = lambda obj: shift(obj, (6, 2)) if canvas_size == (10, 10) else shift(obj, (2, 2))
  
  # 3. Create canvas and paint
  O = paint(canvas(0, canvas_size), recolor(3, shift_object(ofcolor(I, 3))))
  
  # 4. Duplicate on small canvas
  if canvas_size == (10, 10):
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(shift_object(ofcolor(I, 3)), (1, 0)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Size Calculation:**  Determines the canvas size based on the input height.
2. **Shift Function Definition:** Defines a lambda function `shift_object` to shift an object based on the canvas size.
3. **Canvas and Painting:** Creates the canvas and paints the shifted '3' object using the `shift_object` function.
4. **Small Canvas Duplication:** If the canvas is small, duplicates and paints the '3' object one row below.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find '3' object
  threes = ofcolor(I, 3)
  
  # 2. Define offset based on input height 
  offset = (6, 2) if height(I) < 15 else (2, 2)
  
  # 3. Apply transformations based on height
  if height(I) < 15:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(3, shift(threes, offset)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(threes, add(offset, (1, 0)))))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), recolor(3, shift(threes, offset)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '3' Object:** Identifies the '3' object in the input.
2. **Height-Based Offset:** Determines the shift offset based on input height.
3. **Conditional Transformations:**
   - If the input height is less than 15:
      - Creates a 10x10 canvas.
      - Paints the shifted '3' object.
      - Duplicates and paints the '3' object one row below.
   - Otherwise (input height greater than or equal to 15):
      - Creates a 15x15 canvas.
      - Paints the shifted '3' object.
