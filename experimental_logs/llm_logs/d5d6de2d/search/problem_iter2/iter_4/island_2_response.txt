## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on isolating and relocating objects consisting of the digit '3' from the input grid to a blank canvas. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* **Isolation:** The connected component of '3's is identified and extracted from the input grid. 
* **Relocation:**  The extracted '3' component is shifted and painted onto a 10x10 blank canvas at position (5,5).
* **Duplication:**  The '3' component is duplicated and painted again at position (6,6). The size of the duplicated component seems to be the same as the original.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* This transformation is identical to the Input_0 to Output_0 transformation except that there is no duplication of the extracted '3' component.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* This transformation is identical to the Input_0 to Output_0 transformation except that the canvas size is 15x15, the '3' component is painted at position (2,2), and the duplicated '3' component is painted at position (3,3).

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Check input height for canvas dimensions and paint location
  x1 = (10, 10) if height(I) < 15 else (15, 15)
  x2 = (5, 5) if height(I) < 15 else (2, 2)

  # 2. Create a blank canvas
  x3 = canvas(0, x1)

  # 3. Find occurrences of '3'
  x4 = ofcolor(I, 3)

  # 4. Check if '3' exists
  x5 = size(x4) > 0

  # 5. Conditionally paint the '3' component
  O = branch(x5, paint(x3, recolor(3, shift(x4, x2))), x3)
  
  # 6. Duplicate and paint the component if input height is less than 15
  O = branch(height(I) < 15, paint(O, recolor(3, shift(x4, add(x2, (1,1))))), O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Location:** Determines the canvas size and paint location based on the input height.
2. **Blank Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas with the determined dimensions.
3. **Find '3's:** Identifies the indices of all '3' occurrences in the input.
4. **Check Existence:** Verifies if any '3's exist in the input.
5. **Conditional Painting:** If '3's exist, paint them on the canvas at the calculated location.
6. **Conditional Duplication:** If the input height is less than 15, duplicate and paint the '3' component one position down and right.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find the connected component of '3'
  x1 = objects(I, True, False, True)
  x2 = next((obj for obj in x1 if color(obj) == 3), frozenset())

  # 2. Check if the '3' component exists
  x3 = size(x2) > 0

  # 3. Define canvas size and paint location based on input height
  x4 = (10, 10) if height(I) < 15 else (15, 15)
  x5 = (5, 5) if height(I) < 15 else (2, 2)

  # 4. Create a blank canvas
  x6 = canvas(0, x4)

  # 5. Conditionally paint the canvas
  O = branch(x3, paint(x6, recolor(3, shift(toindices(x2), x5))), x6)

  # 6. Duplicate and paint if input height is less than 15
  O = branch(height(I) < 15, paint(O, recolor(3, shift(toindices(x2), add(x5, (1,1))))), O) 
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '3' Component:**  Finds the connected component of '3's.
2. **Check Existence:** Verifies if the '3' component exists.
3. **Canvas and Location:**  Determines the canvas size and paint location based on the input height.
4. **Blank Canvas:**  Creates a blank canvas with the determined dimensions.
5. **Conditional Painting:**  If the '3' component exists, paint it on the canvas at the calculated location.
6. **Conditional Duplication:** If the input height is less than 15, duplicate and paint the '3' component one position down and right.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Extract the '3' component
  x1 = objects(I, True, False, True)
  x2 = extract(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3) if any(color(obj) == 3 for obj in x1) else frozenset()

  # 2. Define canvas size and paint location
  x3 = (10, 10) if height(I) < 15 else (15, 15)
  x4 = (5, 5) if height(I) < 15 else (2, 2)

  # 3. Create the output grid
  O = canvas(0, x3)

  # 4. Paint the extracted '3' component
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(toindices(x2), x4))) if x2 else O

  # 5. Duplicate and paint if input height is less than 15
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(toindices(x2), add(x4, (1,1))))) if height(I) < 15 else O
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '3' Component:**  Extracts the connected component of '3's.
2. **Canvas and Location:**  Defines the canvas size and paint location based on input height.
3. **Output Grid:** Creates the output grid with the determined dimensions.
4. **Paint Component:** Paints the extracted '3' component onto the output grid at the calculated location, only if the component exists.
5. **Conditional Duplication:**  Duplicates and paints the '3' component one position down and right if the input height is less than 15.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify '3' locations and check if they exist
  x1 = ofcolor(I, 3)
  x2 = size(x1) > 0

  # 2. Define canvas size and location based on input height
  x3 = (10, 10) if len(I) < 15 else (15, 15)
  x4 = (5, 5) if len(I) < 15 else (2, 2)

  # 3. Create a blank canvas
  x5 = canvas(0, x3)

  # 4. Conditionally paint the '3' component
  O = branch(x2, paint(x5, recolor(3, shift(x1, x4))), x5)

  # 5. Duplicate and paint if input height is less than 15
  O = branch(len(I) < 15, paint(O, recolor(3, shift(x1, add(x4, (1,1))))), O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '3's and Check Existence:**  Finds '3' locations and checks if any exist.
2. **Canvas and Location:** Defines canvas size and paint location based on input height.
3. **Blank Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas with the determined dimensions.
4. **Conditional Painting:** Conditionally paints the '3' component onto the canvas at the calculated location.
5. **Conditional Duplication:** Duplicates and paints the '3' component one position down and right if the input height is less than 15.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Define a function to extract and paint the '3' component
  def paint_three(canvas, start):
    # Extract the '3' component
    x1 = objects(I, True, False, True)
    x2 = extract(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3) if any(color(obj) == 3 for obj in x1) else frozenset()
    
    # Paint the component onto the canvas
    return paint(canvas, recolor(3, shift(toindices(x2), start))) if x2 else canvas
  
  # 2. Define canvas size and paint location based on input height
  x3 = (10, 10) if height(I) < 15 else (15, 15)
  x4 = (5, 5) if height(I) < 15 else (2, 2)

  # 3. Create a blank canvas
  x5 = canvas(0, x3)

  # 4. Conditionally paint the canvas
  O = paint_three(x5, x4)

  # 5. Duplicate and paint if input height is less than 15
  O = paint_three(O, add(x4, (1,1))) if height(I) < 15 else O
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`paint_three` Function:**  Defines a function to extract and paint the '3' component onto a given canvas at a given starting location.
2. **Canvas and Location:** Defines the canvas size and paint location based on the input height.
3. **Blank Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas with the determined dimensions.
4. **Conditional Painting:**  Calls `paint_three` to paint the '3' component onto the canvas at the calculated location.
5. **Conditional Duplication:** Calls `paint_three` again to duplicate and paint the '3' component one position down and right if the input height is less than 15.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation. They utilize various DSL functions and logic, providing distinct code variations while ensuring the desired output for each input.
