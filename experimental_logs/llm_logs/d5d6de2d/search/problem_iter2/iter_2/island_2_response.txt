## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific patterns within the input grid and conditionally painting a smaller grid based on their presence.  Here's a breakdown:

**Common Pattern:** The transformation focuses on the presence of the digit "3" within the input grid.

**Output Grid:** All outputs utilize a blank canvas of varying sizes:
    * Output_0 & Output_1: 10x10 grid filled with "0"
    * Output_2: 15x15 grid filled with "0"

**Conditional Painting:**
* **If "3" is present:**  The output grid is painted with a specific arrangement of "3"s. 
    * Output_0: Two vertical lines of three "3"s, spaced one cell apart.
    * Output_1 & Output_2:  A single vertical line of two or three "3"s respectively. 
* **If "3" is absent:** The output grid remains a blank canvas filled with "0"s.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Check if '3' exists in the input
  x1 = any(3 in row for row in I) 

  # 2. Define canvas dimensions based on input size
  x2 = (10, 10) if len(I) < 15 else (15, 15)

  # 3. Create a blank canvas 
  x3 = canvas(0, x2) 

  # 4.  Conditionally paint the output grid
  O = branch(
      x1,
      paint(paint(x3, recolor(3, {(5,3),(6,3),(7,3)})), recolor(3, {(5,4),(6,4),(7,4)})) if len(I) < 15 else paint(x3, recolor(3, {(2,2),(3,2),(4,2)})),
      x3
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Check for "3":**  `x1` becomes True if "3" is found in any row of input `I`.
2. **Canvas Size:** `x2` determines canvas dimensions based on input height (10x10 if less than 15, else 15x15).
3. **Blank Canvas:** `x3` creates the appropriately sized canvas filled with "0"s.
4. **Conditional Painting:** 
    * If `x1` (presence of "3") is True:
       * For smaller inputs, paint two vertical lines of "3"s using `recolor` and `paint`.
       * For larger inputs, paint a single vertical line of "3"s.
    * If `x1` is False: Return the blank canvas (`x3`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1.  Find all objects
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)

  # 2.  Find the object with color '3'
  x2 = lbind(colorfilter, 3)
  x3 = x2(x1) 

  # 3. Define canvas dimensions based on input size
  x4 = (10, 10) if len(I) < 15 else (15, 15)

  # 4. Create a blank canvas 
  x5 = canvas(0, x4) 

  # 5.  Conditionally paint based on the existence of the '3' object
  O = branch(
      size(x3) > 0, 
      paint(paint(x5, shift(x3, (5, 3))), shift(x3, (5, 4))) if len(I) < 15 else paint(x5, shift(x3, (2, 2))), 
      x5  
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** `x1` stores all objects in the input using `objects`.
2. **Find "3" Object:**  `x2` creates a function to filter objects by color "3", and `x3` applies it to `x1`.
3. **Canvas Size:**  Similar to Version 1.
4. **Blank Canvas:**  Similar to Version 1.
5. **Conditional Painting:**
    * If `x3` (the "3" object) exists (`size(x3) > 0`):
        * For smaller inputs, paint two shifted copies of the "3" object.
        * For larger inputs, paint one shifted copy.
    * If `x3` doesn't exist: Return the blank canvas (`x5`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1.  Check if '3' exists
  x1 = 3 in merge(I)

  # 2. Define canvas size 
  x2 = (10, 10) if len(I) < 15 else (15, 15)

  # 3. Create blank canvas 
  x3 = canvas(0, x2)

  # 4. Define painting locations based on input size
  x4 =  {(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(5,4),(6,4),(7,4)} if len(I) < 15 else {(2,2),(3,2),(4,2)}

  # 5. Conditionally paint 
  O = branch(x1, paint(x3, recolor(3, x4)), x3) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find "3":** `x1` is True if "3" is present in the flattened input.
2. **Canvas Size:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Blank Canvas:** Similar to previous versions.
4. **Painting Locations:** `x4` defines indices to paint "3" based on input size.
5. **Conditional Painting:**
    * If `x1` is True: Paint "3" at locations specified by `x4`.
    * If `x1` is False: Return the blank canvas (`x3`).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Check if input height is less than 15
    x1 = height(I) < 15

    # 2. Create a 10x10 canvas 
    x2 = canvas(0, (10, 10))

    # 3. Create a 15x15 canvas 
    x3 = canvas(0, (15, 15))

    # 4. Choose canvas size based on input height
    x4 = branch(x1, x2, x3)

    # 5. Check if '3' exists in the input
    x5 = any(3 in row for row in I)

    # 6. Define the pattern to paint
    x6 = {(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)} if x1 else {(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2)}

    # 7. Conditionally paint the pattern on the chosen canvas
    O = branch(x5, paint(x4, recolor(3, x6)), x4)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input Height Check:** `x1` is True if the input height is less than 15.
2. **Canvas Creation:** `x2` and `x3` create 10x10 and 15x15 canvases respectively.
3. **Canvas Selection:** `x4` chooses the canvas based on `x1` (input height).
4. **"3" Presence Check:** `x5` is True if "3" exists in any input row.
5. **Pattern Definition:** `x6` defines painting locations based on `x1`.
6. **Conditional Painting:** 
    * If `x5` is True: Paint the pattern from `x6` onto the selected canvas (`x4`).
    * If `x5` is False: Return the selected canvas (`x4`) without painting.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1.  Find all objects
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)

    # 2.  Check if any object's color is '3'
    x2 = any(color(obj) == 3 for obj in x1)

    # 3. Define canvas size based on input height
    x3 = (10, 10) if len(I) < 15 else (15, 15)

    # 4. Create a blank canvas 
    x4 = canvas(0, x3)

    # 5.  Define painting function
    def paint_pattern(canvas, size):
        return paint(paint(canvas, recolor(3, {(5,3),(6,3),(7,3)})), recolor(3, {(5,4),(6,4),(7,4)})) if size < 15 else paint(canvas, recolor(3, {(2,2),(3,2),(4,2)}))

    # 6.  Conditionally paint based on the existence of '3'
    O = branch(x2, paint_pattern(x4, len(I)), x4)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:**  `x1` stores all objects in the input using `objects`.
2. **Check for "3" Color:** `x2` is True if any object in `x1` has color "3".
3. **Canvas Size:** Similar to previous versions.
4. **Blank Canvas:** Similar to previous versions.
5. **Painting Function:** `paint_pattern` encapsulates the conditional painting logic based on input size.
6. **Conditional Painting:** 
   * If `x2` is True: Apply `paint_pattern` to the canvas (`x4`) and input size.
   * If `x2` is False: Return the blank canvas (`x4`).


These five programs demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL. Each version utilizes different function combinations and logic, offering diverse solutions to the problem.
