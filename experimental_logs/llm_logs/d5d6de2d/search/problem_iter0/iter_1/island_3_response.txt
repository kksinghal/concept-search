## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic appears to involve identifying the horizontal center line of each object in the input grid and drawing a short vertical line, with a value of '3', centered on that line.  

**Let's break down each input-output example:**

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** The transformation identifies two objects. For each object, it calculates the middle column and draws a vertical line of '3's three cells high, centered on the original object's row center.
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:**  This input has one object. The program draws a two-cell vertical line of '3's, centered on the object's middle row and column.
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:** This input showcases the handling of horizontally wider objects. The transformation identifies two objects and draws horizontal lines of '3's, each spanning three cells and centered on the object's middle row.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects from the input grid
  lines = mapply(lambda obj: connect((uppermost(obj) + halve(height(obj) - 1), (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj)) // 2), (uppermost(obj) + halve(height(obj) + 1), (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj)) // 2)), objs) # Calculate the endpoints of the vertical lines for each object
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(lines)) # Fill the vertical lines with value 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** This line extracts all non-background objects from the input grid `I`. 
2. **`lines = mapply(...)`:** For each object in `objs`, this line calculates the starting and ending points of the vertical line to be drawn. The line starts and ends at the middle column of the object and spans three rows centered on the object's vertical center.
3. **`O = fill(I, 3, merge(lines))`:** This line merges all the calculated line segments and then fills them with the value '3' on the input grid `I` to produce the output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Get all objects
  center_points = apply(lambda obj: ((uppermost(obj) + lowermost(obj))//2, (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj))//2), objs) # Calculate the center point of each object
  line_indices = mapply(lambda p: frozenset({(p[0]-1, p[1]),(p[0],p[1]),(p[0]+1,p[1])}), center_points)  # Generate indices for a 3-cell vertical line centered at each object's center
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(line_indices))  # Merge and fill lines 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies and isolates distinct objects within the input grid.
2. **`center_points = apply(...)`:** Calculates the center point of each object.
3. **`line_indices = mapply(...)`:** Generates indices for a vertical line spanning three cells, centered on each object's center point.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, merge(line_indices))`:** Merges the generated line indices and fills the corresponding cells in the input grid with the value '3'. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract the objects 
  def create_line(obj):
    center_j = (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj)) // 2  # Find the middle column of the object
    center_i = (uppermost(obj) + lowermost(obj)) // 2 # Find the middle row of the object
    return frozenset((center_i - 1, center_j), (center_i, center_j), (center_i + 1, center_j))  # Return indices for a vertical line 

  line_indices = mapply(create_line, objs)  # Create lines for each object
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(line_indices)) # Fill the lines on the grid 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** This line identifies and groups connected cells of the same color into distinct objects.
2. **`def create_line(obj): ...`:**  Defines a function that takes an object as input and returns the indices for a vertical line segment spanning three cells centered on that object.
3. **`line_indices = mapply(create_line, objs)`:** Applies the `create_line` function to each object in `objs`, generating a set of indices for each vertical line segment.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, merge(line_indices))`:** Merges all the line indices and then modifies the input grid `I` by setting the cells at the merged indices to '3' to produce the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def draw_vline(obj): 
    start_i = max(0, (uppermost(obj) + lowermost(obj)) // 2 - 1)  # Calculate the starting row index, ensuring it's within the grid bounds
    end_i = min(len(I) - 1, start_i + 2)  # Calculate the ending row index, ensuring it's within the grid bounds
    center_j = (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj)) // 2  # Calculate the middle column index of the object
    return frozenset((i, center_j) for i in range(start_i, end_i + 1)) # Generate indices for the vertical line

  line_segments = mapply(draw_vline, objs)  # Generate line segments for each object
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(line_segments)) # Fill the line segments with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies distinct objects within the input grid.
2. **`def draw_vline(obj):`:** Defines a function to draw a vertical line for each object. 
    - It calculates the starting and ending row indices for the line, ensuring they remain within the grid boundaries.
    - It determines the middle column of the object to position the line.
    - It generates and returns the indices for the vertical line segment.
3. **`line_segments = mapply(draw_vline, objs)`:**  Applies the `draw_vline` function to each object, generating a set of line segments.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, merge(line_segments))`:** Merges all line segments and fills the corresponding cells in the input grid with '3'.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    def make_line(obj):
        top = uppermost(obj)
        bottom = lowermost(obj)
        middle_col = (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj)) // 2
        return frozenset([(i, middle_col) for i in range(max(0, top + (bottom - top) // 2 - 1), min(len(I), top + (bottom - top) // 2 + 2))])

    lines = mapply(make_line, objs)
    O = fill(I, 3, merge(lines))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** This line identifies separate objects within the input grid.
2. **`def make_line(obj): ...`:** Defines a function that takes an object as input and returns a set of indices representing a vertical line. It first calculates the top and bottom rows and the middle column of the object. Then, it constructs a line that spans three cells vertically, centered on the object's middle row and column, ensuring the line doesn't go out of bounds of the input grid.
3. **`lines = mapply(make_line, objs)`:** This line applies the `make_line` function to each object in the `objs` set, generating a set of indices for each vertical line.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, merge(lines))`:**  This line merges all the generated line indices from each object and then fills the corresponding cells in the input grid `I` with the value '3', creating the output grid `O`.

These five versions showcase different ways to achieve the same transformation, offering diversity in logic and function utilization.
