## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following logic:

1. **Identify the target object:** The object formed by the digit '2' in the input grid is identified.
2. **Determine the new location:** The target object's position is shifted to a specific location in the output grid.
3. **Recolor the object:** The object's color is changed from '2' to '3'.
4. **Clear the input:**  All other digits in the input grid are replaced with '0'.

**Specific Observations:**

* **Output_0:** The target object is moved one cell up and its color is changed to '3'.
* **Output_1:** The target object is moved one cell to the right and its color is changed to '3'.
* **Output_2:** The target object is moved two cells to the left and one cell up, and its color is changed to '3'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  target_color = 2
  target_object = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), target_color))
  new_location = subtract(ulcorner(target_object), (1, 0))
  shifted_object = shift(target_object, subtract(new_location, ulcorner(target_object)))
  recolored_object = recolor(3, shifted_object)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolored_object)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `target_color = 2`: Defines the color of the object to be moved.
2. `target_object = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), target_color))`: Extracts the object formed by the `target_color`.
3. `new_location = subtract(ulcorner(target_object), (1, 0))`: Calculates the new upper-left corner position of the object.
4. `shifted_object = shift(target_object, subtract(new_location, ulcorner(target_object)))`: Shifts the object to the new location.
5. `recolored_object = recolor(3, shifted_object)`: Changes the color of the shifted object to '3'.
6. `O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolored_object)`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the recolored object onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), 2))
  new_ulcorner = subtract(ulcorner(obj), (1, -1))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(3, shift(obj, subtract(new_ulcorner, ulcorner(obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), 2))`: Extracts the object formed by '2' using `partition` for efficiency.
2. `new_ulcorner = subtract(ulcorner(obj), (1, -1))`:  Directly calculates the new upper-left corner by subtracting a fixed offset.
3. The remaining code performs object shifting, recoloring, and painting on a blank canvas, similar to Version 1. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  target_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  new_indices = shift(target_indices, (-1, 1))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, j in new_indices:
    if 0 <= i < len(O) and 0 <= j < len(O[0]):
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `target_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)`: Retrieves indices of cells containing '2'.
2. `new_indices = shift(target_indices, (-1, 1))`: Shifts the indices to their new positions.
3. This version directly iterates through `new_indices`, filling the corresponding cells in the output grid with '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2))
  offset = (-1, 1)
  moved_obj = shift(obj, offset)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(3, moved_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2))`: Identifies the object formed by the digit '2'.
2. `offset = (-1, 1)`: Defines the offset for moving the object.
3. `moved_obj = shift(obj, offset)`: Moves the object by the defined offset.
4. `O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(3, moved_obj))`: Creates a blank canvas and paints the moved and recolored object onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  obj_indices = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2)))
  shifted_indices = shift(obj_indices, (-1, 1))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, j in shifted_indices:
    if 0 <= i < len(O) and 0 <= j < len(O[0]):
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. `obj_indices = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2)))`: Extracts the indices of the object formed by the digit '2'.
2. `shifted_indices = shift(obj_indices, (-1, 1))`: Shifts the indices based on the required movement.
3. The code iterates through `shifted_indices`, filling corresponding cells on a blank canvas with '3' only if they are within the grid boundaries.


## Notes:

* Each program version uses distinct DSL functions or logic combinations to achieve the desired transformation.
* These versions demonstrate diverse approaches for solving the problem within the constraints of the DSL. 
* You can further explore and experiment with different DSL functions to discover more solutions.
