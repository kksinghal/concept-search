## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes the largest object composed of the digit '2' and shrinks it horizontally, keeping only its left half. This shrunk version is then shifted down by two units and painted with the digit '3' onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object with color 2
  target_obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) if color(obj) == 2 else 0)

  # Calculate the width of the left half
  half_width = width(target_obj) // 2

  # Create the shrunk object by filtering indices
  shrunk_obj = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in target_obj if j < leftmost(target_obj) + half_width)

  # Shift the shrunk object down
  shifted_obj = shift(shrunk_obj, (2, 0))

  # Paint the shifted object with color 3 on a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(3, shifted_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Object:**  Identifies the largest object made of '2' using `objects` and `argmax`.
2. **Calculate Half Width:** Determines the width of the object's left half.
3. **Create Shrunk Object:** Filters the original object's cells, keeping only those within the left half.
4. **Shift Down:** Shifts the shrunk object two units down.
5. **Paint on Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the shifted, shrunk object with '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of target color
  target_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)

  # Create a mask from the indices
  mask = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1, target_indices))

  # Split the mask and concatenate the left half
  shrunk_mask = hsplit(hconcat(hsplit(mask, 2)[0], hsplit(mask, 2)[1]), 2)[0]

  # Shift the shrunk mask down
  shifted_mask = shift(asobject(shrunk_mask), (2, 0))

  # Paint color 3 where the shifted mask is 1 on a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(3, toindices(asobject(shifted_mask))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Mask:** Generates a mask where '1' represents the target object ('2' in the input).
2. **Shrink Mask:** Splits the mask horizontally and keeps the left half.
3. **Shift Mask:** Shifts the shrunk mask down by two units.
4. **Paint From Mask:** Creates a blank canvas and paints '3' wherever the shifted mask has a '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the leftmost and rightmost columns of the target object
  target_obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) if color(obj) == 2 else 0)
  left_col = leftmost(target_obj)
  right_col = left_col + width(target_obj) // 2

  # Create a new object by filtering cells within the left half
  new_obj = frozenset((3, (i, j + 2)) for v, (i, j) in target_obj if left_col <= j < right_col)

  # Paint the new object onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Boundaries:**  Identifies the left and middle column indices of the target object.
2. **Filter and Create:**  Constructs the new object by directly filtering and shifting the cells of the original object within the left half boundaries.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the new object with its designated color ('3').

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the target object
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) if color(obj) == 2 else 0)

  # Crop the left half of the object
  cropped_obj = toobject(crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), width(obj)//2)), I)

  # Shift the cropped object down
  shifted_obj = shift(cropped_obj, (2, 0))

  # Paint the shifted object onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(3, shifted_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target:**  Locates the largest object composed of '2'.
2. **Crop Left Half:**  Extracts the left half of the target object using `crop` based on its dimensions.
3. **Shift Downward:**  Moves the cropped object two units down.
4. **Paint with New Color:**  Paints the shifted, cropped object onto a blank canvas using '3' as the color.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the target object and calculate its half width
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) if color(obj) == 2 else 0)
  half_width = width(obj) // 2

  # Create a horizontal split line at the half width
  split_line =  frozenset((0, (i, leftmost(obj) + half_width)) for i in range(height(I)))

  # Remove everything right of the split line from the object
  left_half_obj = difference(obj, toobject(shoot((0, leftmost(obj) + half_width), (0, 1)), I))

  # Shift the left half down and paint it with color 3 on a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(3, shift(left_half_obj, (2, 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate and Measure:**  Finds the largest object ('2') and calculates its midpoint horizontally.
2. **Generate Split Line:**  Creates a vertical line of '0's at the calculated midpoint.
3. **Remove Right Half:**  Subtracts all cells from the target object that lie to the right of the split line, effectively removing its right half.
4. **Shift and Paint:**  Shifts the remaining left half down by two units and paints it with the new color ('3') on a blank canvas.
