## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples follows these steps:

1. **Identify the non-background object:** The input grids consist of a background color (0) and a single non-background object (represented by the digit '2').
2. **Determine the bounding box of the object:**  Find the smallest rectangle that fully encloses the object.
3. **Color the top line of the bounding box with a new color (3):**  The output grid retains the original object and background but adds a new color (3) to the top line of the object's bounding box.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  
  upper_left = ulcorner(obj)
  upper_right = urcorner(obj)
  line = connect(upper_left, upper_right)
  O = fill(I, THREE, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`:** Identifies the non-background object in the input grid `I`. `objects` function with `univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T` ensures only the object formed by the digit '2' is extracted.
2. **`upper_left = ulcorner(obj)`:** Finds the indices of the upper-left corner of the object.
3. **`upper_right = urcorner(obj)`:** Finds the indices of the upper-right corner of the object.
4. **`line = connect(upper_left, upper_right)`:** Generates a set of indices representing the horizontal line connecting the upper-left and upper-right corners, forming the top line of the bounding box.
5. **`O = fill(I, THREE, line)`:**  Fills the cells at the indices specified by `line` with the value '3' on the input grid `I`, creating the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = asobject(I)
  obj = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[0] != ZERO)
  upper_row = minimum(frozenset(i for _, (i, _) in obj))
  left_col = minimum(frozenset(j for _, (_, j) in obj))
  right_col = maximum(frozenset(j for _, (_, j) in obj))
  line = frozenset((upper_row, j) for j in range(left_col, right_col + 1))
  O = fill(I, THREE, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = asobject(I)`:** Converts the entire grid `I` into an object representation.
2. **`obj = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[0] != ZERO)`:** Filters out the background cells from the object, leaving only cells with the object color.
3. **`upper_row = minimum(frozenset(i for _, (i, _) in obj))`:**  Finds the row index of the topmost object cell.
4. **`left_col = minimum(frozenset(j for _, (_, j) in obj))`:** Finds the column index of the leftmost object cell.
5. **`right_col = maximum(frozenset(j for _, (_, j) in obj))`:** Finds the column index of the rightmost object cell.
6. **`line = frozenset((upper_row, j) for j in range(left_col, right_col + 1))`:** Creates a set of indices representing the horizontal line at the `upper_row` spanning from the `left_col` to `right_col`, forming the top line of the bounding box.
7. **`O = fill(I, THREE, line)`:** Fills the cells at the indices in `line` with the value '3' on the input grid `I`, creating the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  bbox = backdrop(obj) 
  top_line = sfilter(bbox, lambda cell: cell[0] == uppermost(obj))
  O = fill(I, THREE, top_line) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`:** Extracts the non-background object from the grid `I`.
2. **`bbox = backdrop(obj)`:**  Determines the set of indices within the bounding box of the object. 
3. **`top_line = sfilter(bbox, lambda cell: cell[0] == uppermost(obj))`:** Filters the `bbox` indices, keeping only those in the same row as the object's uppermost cell, resulting in the top line indices. 
4. **`O = fill(I, THREE, top_line)`:**  Fills the `top_line` indices with the value '3' on the input grid `I` to generate the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T)) 
  shifted_down = shift(obj, DOWN)
  unioned = obj | shifted_down 
  top_line = difference(backdrop(unioned), backdrop(shifted_down)) 
  O = fill(I, THREE, top_line)  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`:**  Extracts the non-background object from the grid `I`.
2. **`shifted_down = shift(obj, DOWN)`:** Creates a copy of the object shifted one row down.
3. **`unioned = obj | shifted_down`:**  Combines the original and shifted objects.
4. **`top_line = difference(backdrop(unioned), backdrop(shifted_down))`:** Calculates the set difference between the bounding box indices of the combined object and the shifted object. This results in the indices of the top line of the original object's bounding box.
5. **`O = fill(I, THREE, top_line)`:** Fills the cells at `top_line` indices with '3' on the input grid `I`, creating the output grid `O`.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  top_left = ulcorner(obj)
  width = rightmost(obj) - leftmost(obj) + 1
  line = frozenset((top_left[0], top_left[1] + j) for j in range(width))
  O = fill(I, THREE, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`:**  Extracts the non-background object.
2. **`top_left = ulcorner(obj)`:**  Gets the upper-left corner of the object.
3. **`width = rightmost(obj) - leftmost(obj) + 1`:** Calculates the width of the object's bounding box.
4. **`line = frozenset((top_left[0], top_left[1] + j) for j in range(width))`:**  Generates the indices for the top line of the bounding box, starting from the `top_left` corner and extending horizontally for the calculated `width`.
5. **`O = fill(I, THREE, line)`:**  Fills the `line` indices with '3' on the input grid `I` to produce the output grid `O`.
