## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying each distinct object (connected component) in the input grid and replacing a portion of it with a 2x2 square of color '3'. The square's position is determined by the object's original top-left corner, shifted two rows upwards. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The transformation affects both objects. The top-left corner of the first object (value '2') is shifted two rows up and a 2x2 square of '3' is placed there.  The same logic is applied to the second object.
* **Input_1:** Only the first object is affected as it's the only one with values other than the background '0'. Its top-left corner is shifted two rows up, and a 2x2 '3' square is placed. Since the shift pushes the square off the grid, only the bottom row of the square is visible in the output.
* **Input_2:** Similar to Input_0, the transformation is applied to all objects. However, since the shift pushes the 2x2 square of the second object off the grid, only the bottom row of that square is visible in the output.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T) # Find all non-background objects
  shifted_corners = apply(lambda obj: shift(frozenset({ulcorner(obj)}), (-2, 0)), objs)  # Shift top-left corner of each object upwards
  squares = mapply(lambda corner: frozenset((3, (i, j)) for i, j in backdrop(corner) if i in range(uppermost(corner), uppermost(corner) + 2) and j in range(leftmost(corner), leftmost(corner) + 2)), shifted_corners)  # Generate 2x2 square objects
  O = paint(I, merge(squares))  # Paint squares onto the original grid 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all connected components (objects) in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Shift Corners:** For each object, `shift(frozenset({ulcorner(obj)}), (-2, 0))` finds its top-left corner and shifts it two rows up.
3. **Generate Squares:** Using `backdrop` and the shifted corners, 2x2 squares are generated as objects.
4. **Paint Squares:** Finally, `paint` draws these squares onto the input grid `I` to produce the output.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  
    top_left_corners = apply(lambda obj: ulcorner(obj), objs) 
    shifted_corners = apply(lambda cell: (cell[0] - 2, cell[1]), top_left_corners)  
    squares = apply(lambda cell: frozenset({(cell[0] + i, cell[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}), shifted_corners)  
    O = fill(I, 3, merge(squares))  
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects & Corners:** Similar to version 1, this identifies objects and their top-left corners.
2. **Shift and Create Squares:** It shifts the corners two rows up and then uses a nested loop within `frozenset` to generate the 2x2 square indices.
3. **Fill Squares:** Finally, it directly fills the grid `I` with '3' at the calculated square indices.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-2, 0)), objs) # Shift each object two rows up
    squares = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0<=i<2 and 0<=j<2), shifted_objs)  # Extract the top-left 2x2 square from each shifted object
    O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(squares))) # Paint the squares with color '3'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Objects:** This version directly shifts each entire object two rows up.
2. **Extract Squares:** It then extracts the top-left 2x2 portion from each shifted object, handling cases where objects might be smaller than 2x2.
3. **Recolor & Paint:** It recolors the extracted squares to '3' and paints them onto the original grid. 


**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  tops = apply(lambda obj: crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (1, width(obj))), objs)  # Extract top row of each object
  shifted_tops = apply(lambda top: shift(top, (-2, 0)), tops)  # Shift top row two rows up
  squares = mapply(lambda top_row: frozenset((3, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in asobject(top_row) for k in range(2) for l in range(2) if 0<=i + k < len(I) and 0<= j + l < len(I[0])), shifted_tops)  # Generate squares from shifted top rows
  O = paint(I, merge(squares))  # Paint squares onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Shift Top Rows:** This version extracts the top row of each object and shifts it two rows up.
2. **Generate Squares:**  It then uses the shifted top row to determine the square's position, generating the 2x2 square indices.
3. **Paint Squares:** Finally, it paints the generated squares onto the original grid.


**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    shifted_indices = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), (-2,0)), objs)
    squares = mapply(lambda indices: frozenset((3, (i, j)) for i, j in indices if i in range(2)), shifted_indices)
    O = paint(I, merge(squares))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Object Indices:** This version directly shifts the indices of all cells belonging to each object two rows up.
2. **Filter for Squares:** It then filters the shifted indices, keeping only those that fall within the top two rows (i.e., forming the 2x2 squares).
3. **Paint Squares:** Finally, it paints the squares onto the original grid using the filtered indices.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version leverages different combinations of DSL functions, offering distinct logic and code structures.
