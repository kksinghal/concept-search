## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shrinks the target object (color 2) horizontally, keeping only the left half, shifts it down by 2 units, recolors it to 3, and paints it on a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Input 0:**

- The target object is shrunk horizontally, preserving its height.
- The shrunk object is shifted down by 2 units.
- The color of the shifted object is changed to 3.
- The transformed object is painted onto a blank canvas.

**Input 1 & 2:**

- The same logic is applied to these inputs, resulting in a horizontally shrunk, downward shifted, and recolored object painted on a blank canvas.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Find the target object
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) if color(obj) == 2 else 0)

  # Calculate the shrinking point
  shrink_point = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)

  # Shrink object horizontally by cropping
  shrunk_obj = toobject(frozenset((i,j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < shrink_point[1]), I)

  # Shift and recolor the shrunk object
  transformed_obj = recolor(3, shift(shrunk_obj, (2, 0)))

  # Paint on canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), transformed_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Object:**  Identifies the largest object with color 2.
2. **Calculate Shrinking Point:** Determines the column index where the object should be split for shrinking.
3. **Shrink Object:** Crops the object horizontally using the shrinking point.
4. **Shift and Recolor:** Shifts the shrunk object down by 2 units and changes its color to 3.
5. **Paint on Canvas:** Paints the transformed object onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # Find the target object
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) if color(obj) == 2 else 0)
  
  # Create a mask for the left half of the object
  mask = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(obj)) for j in range(width(obj) // 2))
  
  # Apply the mask to the object
  shrunk_obj = toobject(shift(mask, ulcorner(obj)), I)

  # Shift and recolor the shrunk object
  transformed_obj = recolor(3, shift(shrunk_obj, (2, 0)))

  # Paint on canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), transformed_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create Mask:** Generates a mask representing the left half of the object's bounding box.
3. **Apply Mask:** Shifts the mask to the object's position and extracts the corresponding cells from the input grid.
4. **Shift and Recolor:**  Same as Version 1.
5. **Paint on Canvas:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  # Find the target object's bounding box
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) if color(obj) == 2 else 0)
  bbox = backdrop(obj)

  # Shrink the bounding box horizontally
  shrunk_bbox = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in bbox if j < leftmost(bbox) + width(bbox) // 2)

  # Shift the shrunk bounding box down
  shifted_bbox = shift(shrunk_bbox, (2, 0))

  # Paint the new object within the shifted bounding box
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(3, toobject(shifted_bbox, I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Bounding Box:**  Finds the bounding box of the target object.
2. **Shrink Bounding Box:**  Shrinks the bounding box horizontally to encompass only the left half.
3. **Shift Bounding Box:** Shifts the shrunk bounding box down by 2 units.
4. **Paint within Bounding Box:** Paints the area within the shifted bounding box with color 3 on a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # Find the target object
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) if color(obj) == 2 else 0)

  # Extract the left half of the object directly
  shrunk_obj = frozenset((color(obj), (i, j)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)

  # Shift and recolor the shrunk object
  transformed_obj = recolor(3, shift(shrunk_obj, (2, 0)))

  # Paint on canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), transformed_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Extract Left Half:**  Directly extracts the left half of the object based on column indices.
3. **Shift and Recolor:**  Same as Version 1.
4. **Paint on Canvas:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  # Find the target object
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) if color(obj) == 2 else 0)

  # Shrink object horizontally using hsplit
  shrunk_obj = toobject(asindices(hsplit(subgrid(obj, I), 2)[0]), I)

  # Shift and recolor the shrunk object
  transformed_obj = recolor(3, shift(shrunk_obj, (2, 0)))

  # Paint on canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), transformed_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shrink Object with hsplit:** Splits the object's subgrid horizontally into two halves and takes the first half.
3. **Shift and Recolor:**  Same as Version 1.
4. **Paint on Canvas:** Same as Version 1.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions or function combinations, offering a diverse set of solutions to the problem.
