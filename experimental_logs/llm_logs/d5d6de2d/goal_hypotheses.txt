['Turn all the red blocks into black blocks. Then, for each group of red blocks, count the number of red blocks in that group. Finally, draw a horizontal line of green blocks with the same number of blocks as the count, centered at the same horizontal position as the original group of red blocks.', 'Identify each cluster of red blocks in the input. Replace each cluster with a horizontal green line of the same width, centered at the same horizontal position. All other blocks become black.', 'Change all red blocks to black. For each group of connected red blocks in the input, count the number of blocks in the group. Draw a horizontal green line of that length, centered horizontally where the red group was located.', 'For every cluster of adjacent red blocks, replace it with a horizontal green line of equal length, positioned at the same horizontal center. All other blocks become black.', 'Locate each connected group of red blocks. Count the number of red blocks in each group. Replace each group with a horizontal line of green blocks of the same length, centered at the same horizontal position as the original red group. All other blocks should be black. ']["Find the first object in the input that is colored with a color other than 0. Create a 3x(width of the object) rectangle of color 3. Move the new shape two spaces down from the original object's position. Paint the moved shape onto a blank canvas the same size as the input.", "Identify the first non-zero colored object. Create a horizontal bar of color 3, three units tall, spanning the width of the identified object, and position it two rows below the original object's location on an empty canvas of the same dimensions.", 'Locate the first object with a color different from 0. Create a new rectangle of color 3, three units high and as wide as the object. Shift this rectangle two units down from the original object. Place this shifted rectangle on a blank canvas matching the input size.', 'For the first non-zero color object found, replace it with a horizontal line of color 3, three units thick, directly below its original position, maintaining the same width, on a blank canvas of identical dimensions.', 'Detect the first object with a color other than 0. Generate a horizontal line of color 3, three units in height, with the same width as the detected object, and position it two units below the original object on a blank canvas of the same size.
