## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve re-arranging the columns of the input grid based on the values present in the first row. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
```
2 2 1
1 5 1
5 2 2
```
**Output_0:**
```
2 1 5
2 5 2
1 1 2
```
- The first row of the input (2 2 1) dictates the column order in the output. 
- The output grid has columns arranged as: column with value '2', column with value '1', and column with value '5'.

**Input_1:**
```
2 2 5
6 2 2
5 5 5 
```
**Output_1:**
```
2 6 5
2 2 5
5 2 5
```
- Similar to the previous example, the output columns are arranged based on the order of values in the first row of the input: '2', '6', and '5'.

**Input_2:**
```
9 9 5
5 5 8
5 8 9 
```
**Output_2:**
```
9 5 5
9 5 8
5 8 9
```
- Output column order: column with '9', column with '5', and column with '5' (repeated value retains its order from the input).

**Input_3:**
```
2 6 6
2 1 1
2 6 2
```
**Output_3:**
```
2 2 2
6 1 6
6 1 2
```
- Output column order: column with '2', column with '2' (repeated), and column with '6'.


## Code Generation:

Based on the analysis, the transformation can be achieved by identifying the unique values in the first row of the input grid and then constructing the output grid by extracting columns corresponding to these values in order. 

**Note:** Since I don't have access to the two unprovided programs you mentioned, the following solutions are inspired by the provided programs and general DSL usage, aiming to provide diversity in logic and function combinations.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Extract the first row of the input grid
  x1 = I[0]

  # Get unique values from the first row
  x2 = dedupe(x1) 

  # Create a list to store the rearranged columns
  x3 = initset(()) 

  # Iterate through the unique values
  for v in x2:
    # Extract columns corresponding to the current value
    x4 = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if I[0][j] == v)

    # Append the extracted column to the list
    x3 = combine(x3, (x4,)) 

  # Transpose the list to get the final output grid
  O = dmirror(x3) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1.  `x1 = I[0]`: Extracts the first row of the input grid.
2.  `x2 = dedupe(x1)`: Removes duplicate values from the first row to get the unique column identifiers.
3.  `x3 = initset(())`: Initializes an empty tuple to store rearranged columns.
4.  The `for` loop iterates over each unique value (`v`) in `x2`:
    *   `x4 = ...`: Extracts columns from the input grid (`I`) where the first row value matches `v`.
    *   `x3 = combine(x3, (x4,))`: Appends the extracted column (`x4`) to the list `x3`.
5.  `O = dmirror(x3)`: Transposes the list of columns (`x3`) to form the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Get unique values from the first row and their indices
  x1 = tuple((I[0][j], j) for j in range(width(I)))
  x2 = dedupe(x1)

  # Construct the output grid
  O = tuple(
      tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)) for v, j in x2 if j == k) 
      for k in range(width(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `x1 = ...`: Creates a tuple of pairs, each containing a value from the first row and its column index.
2.  `x2 = dedupe(x1)`:  Removes duplicate pairs from `x1`, keeping the first occurrence of each unique value and its index.
3.  `O = ...`: Constructs the output grid directly using nested loops:
    *   The outer loop iterates through column indices (`k`) of the output grid.
    *   The inner loop iterates through the unique values and their indices (`v, j`) from `x2`.
    *   If the column index `j` from `x2` matches the current output column index `k`, the corresponding value from the input grid (`I[i][j]`) is added to the output column.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Get indices of unique values in the first row
  x1 = tuple((I[0][j],j) for j in range(width(I)))
  x2 = dedupe(x1)
  x3 = tuple(j for v,j in x2)

  # Construct the output grid by rearranging columns
  O = tuple(
      tuple(I[i][j] for j in x3) 
      for i in range(height(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `x1 = ...`:  Creates a tuple of pairs, each containing a value from the first row and its column index.
2.  `x2 = dedupe(x1)`: Removes duplicate pairs, preserving order.
3.  `x3 = tuple(j for v,j in x2)`: Extracts only the column indices from the deduplicated pairs.
4.  `O = ...`: Constructs the output grid:
    *   The outer loop iterates through rows of the input grid.
    *   The inner loop iterates through the rearranged column indices (`x3`) and picks values from the input grid based on these indices, effectively rearranging the columns.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Create a function to extract a column based on value and index
  def extract_column(grid, value, index): 
    return tuple(grid[i][index] for i in range(height(grid)))

  # Get unique values and their indices from the first row
  x1 = tuple((I[0][j], j) for j in range(width(I)))
  x2 = dedupe(x1)

  # Construct the output grid by extracting columns
  O = tuple(extract_column(I, v, j) for v, j in x2) 
  O = dmirror(O) # Transpose the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `extract_column(grid, value, index)`: Defines a helper function to extract a specific column from a grid based on a value and its index.
2.  `x1 = ...` and `x2 = ...`:  Same logic as in previous versions to get unique values and their indices from the first row.
3.  `O = ...`: Constructs the output grid:
    *   Iterates through the unique values and indices (`v, j`) in `x2`.
    *   Uses the `extract_column` function to retrieve the entire column corresponding to the current value and index.
    *   `O = dmirror(O)`: Finally, transposes the constructed grid to get the correct output orientation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Create a function to find the column index of a value in the first row
  def find_column(grid, value):
    return next((j for j in range(width(grid)) if grid[0][j] == value), None)

  # Get unique values from the first row
  x1 = dedupe(I[0])

  # Construct the output grid
  O = tuple(
      tuple(I[i][find_column(I, v)] for v in x1)
      for i in range(height(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `find_column(grid, value)`: Defines a helper function to find the index of the first occurrence of a specific value in the first row of the grid.
2.  `x1 = dedupe(I[0])`:  Gets unique values from the first row of the input grid.
3.  `O = ...`:  Constructs the output grid:
    *   The outer loop iterates through each row of the input grid.
    *   The inner loop iterates through the unique values (`v`) from `x1`.
    *   For each unique value, `find_column` is used to locate its column index in the first row.
    *   The value at the located index from the current row is then added to the output grid, effectively rearranging the columns. 

Remember to test these programs thoroughly with various input grids to ensure they consistently produce the expected output.
