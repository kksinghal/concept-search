## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves swapping the rightmost object of one color with the leftmost object of another color. 

Let's break down each example:

**Input_0:**

* Rightmost '5' object swaps with the leftmost '1' object.

**Input_1:**

* Rightmost '2' object swaps with the leftmost '6' object.

**Input_2:**

* Rightmost '9' object swaps with the leftmost '5' object.

**Input_3:**

* Rightmost '6' object swaps with the leftmost '2' object.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects from the grid
  x2 = apply(color, x1) # Get colors of all the objects
  x3 = astuple(first(x2), last(x2)) # Construct a tuple of first and last colors
  x4 = lbind(colorfilter, x1) # Bind colorfilter to object list
  x5 = rbind(argmax, rightmost) # Bind argmax to rightmost function
  x6 = compose(x5, x4) # Find the rightmost object of specific color
  x7 = mapply(x6, x3) # Get rightmost objects for both colors
  x8 = apply(ulcorner, x7) # Get the upper-left corner indices of the objects
  x9 = astuple(index(I, first(x8)), index(I, last(x8))) # Get the colors of the objects
  x10 = apply(lbind(colorfilter, x1), x9) # Filter objects based on colors
  x11 = apply(rbind(argmin, leftmost), x10) # Find the leftmost objects for both colors
  x12 = merge(x11) # Merge all the objects
  O = move(move(I, first(x12), subtract(last(x8), first(x8))), last(x12), subtract(first(x8), last(x8))) # Swap the objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract objects and their colors from the input grid.
2. Identify the colors of the rightmost and leftmost objects.
3. Locate the rightmost object of the first color and the leftmost object of the second color.
4. Swap the positions of these two objects using the `move` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = objects(I, T, F, T)
  colors = totuple(palette(obj))
  rightmost_obj = argmax(obj, rightmost)
  rightmost_color = color(rightmost_obj)
  leftmost_obj = argmin(sfilter(obj, lambda o: color(o) == other(colors, rightmost_color)), leftmost)
  O = move(move(I, leftmost_obj, gravitate(leftmost_obj, rightmost_obj)), rightmost_obj, gravitate(rightmost_obj, leftmost_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Extract objects and their colors.
2.  Identify the rightmost object and its color.
3.  Find the leftmost object with a different color.
4.  Calculate the relative movement needed for swapping using `gravitate`.
5.  Perform the swap using the calculated movements and the `move` function.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  colors = palette(objs)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, rightmost)
  rightmost_color = color(rightmost_obj)
  other_color = first(difference(colors, {rightmost_color}))
  leftmost_obj = argmin(colorfilter(objs, other_color), leftmost)
  offset = subtract(ulcorner(rightmost_obj), ulcorner(leftmost_obj))
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I, rightmost_obj), leftmost_obj), shift(leftmost_obj, offset)), shift(rightmost_obj, invert(offset)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Extract objects and identify the rightmost object and its color.
2.  Find the other color present in the grid.
3.  Locate the leftmost object with the "other" color.
4.  Calculate the offset between the upper-left corners of the two objects.
5.  Use `cover` to remove both objects from the grid.
6.  Use `paint` and `shift` to place the objects at their swapped positions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    right_color = color(argmax(objs, rightmost))
    left_color = other(palette(objs), right_color)
    right_obj = extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == right_color)
    left_obj = extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == left_color)
    r_corner = ulcorner(right_obj)
    l_corner = ulcorner(left_obj)
    new_grid = paint(cover(I, right_obj), shift(right_obj, subtract(l_corner, r_corner)))
    O = paint(cover(new_grid, left_obj), shift(left_obj, subtract(r_corner, l_corner)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Identify the color of the rightmost object and find the other color.
2.  Extract the rightmost object with the 'right_color' and the leftmost object with the 'left_color'.
3.  Get the upper-left corner coordinates of both objects.
4.  Calculate the offset needed for the swap.
5.  Remove the rightmost object, shift it to the left, and paint it back.
6.  Remove the leftmost object, shift it to the right, and paint it back.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, rightmost)
  rightmost_color = color(rightmost_obj)
  leftmost_obj = argmin(sfilter(objs, lambda o: color(o) != rightmost_color), leftmost)
  r_indices = toindices(rightmost_obj)
  l_indices = toindices(leftmost_obj)
  moved_grid = fill(fill(I, rightmost_color, l_indices), color(leftmost_obj), r_indices)
  O = paint(cover(moved_grid, rightmost_obj), rightmost_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Extract all objects from the grid.
2.  Find the rightmost object and its color.
3.  Locate the leftmost object with a different color.
4.  Get the indices of cells belonging to both objects.
5.  Overwrite the leftmost object with the rightmost object's color.
6.  Overwrite the rightmost object's original location with the leftmost object's color.
7.  Finally, repaint the rightmost object at its original location, effectively swapping them.

These five programs showcase diverse ways to achieve the desired object swapping transformation within the DSL constraints. Each version utilizes a distinct combination of functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
