## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extracting objects consisting of the digit '5' from the input grid, removing them from their original position, and then placing them back onto the grid but shifted to the right edge, aligned with their original top edges. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- Two distinct '5'-objects are identified. 
- The 3x3 square object is moved to the right edge, maintaining its top row alignment.
- The 2x1 vertical object is similarly shifted to the right edge, retaining its top row position.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- A single '5'-object in an 'L' shape is identified.
- This object is shifted to the right edge, maintaining its top row alignment.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
-  Similar to Input_1, a single '5'-object in an altered 'L' shape is identified and shifted to the right edge, keeping the top row alignment.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), 5)  # Extract '5'-objects
  shifted_fives = frozenset(shift(obj, (len(I[0]) - rightmost(obj) - 1, 0)) for obj in fives)  # Shift each object
  return paint(cover(I, merge(fives)), merge(shifted_fives))  # Paint shifted objects onto a cleared grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract '5'-objects:** We use `colorfilter` and `objects` to isolate the '5'-objects from the input grid.
2. **Shift each object:** For each extracted object, we calculate the shift amount to align it with the right edge while maintaining its top row position using `shift` and `rightmost`.
3. **Paint onto a cleared grid:**  We first use `cover` and `merge` to remove the original '5'-objects from the input grid. Then, we use `paint` and `merge` again to place the shifted objects onto the cleared grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      replace(I, 5, 0),  # Replace '5' with background color
      merge(
          shift(recolor(5, obj), (len(I[0]) - rightmost(obj) - 1, 0))
          for obj in objects(replace(I, 5, 1), True, False, True) # Extract objects after temporarily marking '5' as non-background
      )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Replace '5' with background:** Temporarily replace '5' with the background color (0) to easily extract other objects.
2. **Extract objects and shift:** Extract all objects (including those originally '5's) and shift them to the right edge using `objects`, `shift`, and `rightmost`.
3. **Recolor and paint:** Recolor the shifted objects back to '5' using `recolor` and paint them onto the grid where '5's were replaced with background color using `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = partition(replace(I, 5, 1))  # Partition after temporarily marking '5' as a unique color
  other = asobject(replace(I, 5, 0))  # Extract all non-'5' cells
  shifted_fives = merge(
      shift(obj, (len(I[0]) - rightmost(obj) - 1, 0))
      for obj in fives if color(obj) == 1  # Select and shift the objects that were originally '5's
  )
  return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), other), shifted_fives)  # Paint non-'5's first, then shifted '5's
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Partition and extract:**  Temporarily recolor '5's and use `partition` to separate all objects. Extract non-'5' cells using `asobject`.
2. **Shift '5'-objects:**  Filter for objects that were originally '5's and shift them to the right edge.
3. **Paint in layers:** Create a blank canvas and paint the non-'5' cells first. Then, paint the shifted '5'-objects on top.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      replace(I, 5, 0),  # Replace '5's with background
      merge(
          shift(obj, (len(I[0]) - rightmost(obj) - 1, 0)) 
          for obj in objects(asobject(I), True, False, True) if color(obj) == 5  # Extract and shift only '5'-objects
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Replace '5's:** Replace all '5' occurrences with the background color.
2. **Extract and shift '5'-objects:** Extract all '5'-objects from the original input using `objects` and `asobject` and shift them to the right edge.
3. **Paint shifted objects:** Paint the shifted '5'-objects onto the modified grid where '5's were replaced with background.

**Program Version 5:** 
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)  # Get indices of all '5's
  O = fill(I, 0, five_indices)  # Clear the original '5's
  for i, j in five_indices:
    new_j = len(I[0]) - 1  # Calculate the new column index for right edge alignment
    O = paint(O, {(5, (i, new_j))})  # Paint individual '5's at the new positions
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify and clear '5's:** Find the indices of all '5's using `ofcolor` and replace them with the background color using `fill`.
2. **Shift and paint individual cells:** Iterate through the '5' indices, calculate the new column index for right alignment, and paint individual '5's at the new location using `paint`.
