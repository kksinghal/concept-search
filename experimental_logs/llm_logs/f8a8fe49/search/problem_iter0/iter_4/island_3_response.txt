## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects within the grid and relocating them to new positions. 

**Object of Interest:** The object composed of the digit '5'.

**Movement Pattern:** The '5' object is extracted and shifted to a new location based on its orientation:

* **Horizontal Orientation:** If the object's width is greater than its height, it's moved two cells upwards.
* **Vertical Orientation:** If the object's height is greater than its width, it's moved two cells to the right.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_five = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FIVE))
  is_horizontal = greater(width(obj_five), height(obj_five))
  direction = (0, -2) if is_horizontal else (2, 0)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_five), shift(obj_five, direction))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the '5' Object:** `first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FIVE))` extracts the object composed of the digit '5' from the input grid 'I'.
2. **Determine Orientation:** `greater(width(obj_five), height(obj_five))` checks if the width of the '5' object is greater than its height. 
3. **Set Movement Direction:**  The `direction` is set to `(0, -2)` (upwards) if horizontal, otherwise `(2, 0)` (right).
4. **Relocate the Object:** `paint(cover(I, obj_five), shift(obj_five, direction))` first removes the original '5' object from the grid and then paints a copy at the new location determined by the `direction`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_five = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FIVE)
  offset = (0, -2) if width(obj_five) > height(obj_five) else (2, 0)
  O = paint(I, shift(obj_five, add(ulcorner(obj_five), offset)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '5' Object:**  `extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FIVE)`  locates the object with color '5'.
2. **Calculate Offset:**  `(0, -2)` for horizontal orientation, else `(2, 0)`.
3. **Calculate New Position:** `add(ulcorner(obj_five), offset)` determines the new upper-left corner position based on the offset.
4. **Paint at New Location:**  The '5' object is painted directly onto the grid at the calculated new position.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  move_up = width(five_indices) > height(five_indices)
  new_indices = shift(five_indices, (0, -2)) if move_up else shift(five_indices, (2, 0)) 
  O = fill(cover(I, five_indices), FIVE, new_indices)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' Indices:** `ofcolor(I, FIVE)` gets indices of cells with value '5'.
2. **Decide Upward Move:**  `width(five_indices) > height(five_indices)` checks for horizontal orientation to move upwards.
3. **Calculate New Indices:** Shift indices up by 2 or right by 2 based on orientation.
4. **Fill at New Indices:**  Clear original '5' cells and fill '5' at the new indices. 


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FIVE)
  move_right = height(five_obj) > width(five_obj) 
  new_obj = shift(five_obj, (2, 0)) if move_right else shift(five_obj, (0, -2)) 
  O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), FIVE, toindices(new_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '5' Object:**  `argmax` finds the object where `color(obj) == FIVE` is True.
2. **Check Vertical Orientation:** `height(five_obj) > width(five_obj)` determines if a rightward move is needed.
3. **Shift Object:** Shift the object either right or up based on the orientation.
4. **Paint Shifted Object:**  Clear the original object and paint the shifted version.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = next(obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == FIVE)
  horizontal = width(fives) > height(fives)
  new_fives = shift(fives, (0, -2) if horizontal else (2, 0))
  O = paint(I, FIVE, toindices(difference(new_fives, fives)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '5' Object:**  Iterate through objects to find the one with color '5'.
2. **Check Horizontal Orientation:** Determine if the object is wider than it is tall.
3. **Calculate Shifted Object:** Shift the object based on its orientation.
4. **Paint Only New Cells:**  Efficiently paint only the newly shifted cells of the object.
