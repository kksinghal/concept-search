## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (5 in this case) and moving them to the right edge of the grid while maintaining their relative vertical positions. The remaining objects remain unchanged. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The object formed by digit '5' is moved to the right edge of the grid, maintaining its vertical position.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** 
* Similar to Input_0, the object formed by '5' is shifted to the right edge, preserving its vertical arrangement.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* The transformation remains consistent: the '5' object is moved to the right edge while retaining its vertical structure.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 5)
  other_objs = difference(objs, target_objs)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (0, 14 - rightmost(obj))) for obj in target_objs)
  O = I
  for obj in other_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  for obj in shifted_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid `I` (`objs`).
2. **Filter Target Objects:** Isolate objects of color '5' (`target_objs`).
3. **Separate Remaining Objects:**  Get the remaining objects (`other_objs`).
4. **Shift Target Objects:** Move each '5' object to the right edge (`shifted_objs`).
5. **Paint Objects:** Paint all objects back onto the grid, starting with `other_objs` then `shifted_objs`, resulting in the final output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  five_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
  O = move(I, five_obj, (0, 14 - rightmost(five_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Target Object:** Directly extract the object formed by digit '5' (`five_obj`).
2. **Move and Paint:** Calculate the shift needed to move the object to the right edge and use `move` to execute this shift and paint the object on the grid, generating the output `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)
  O = fill(I, 0, five_indices)
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(5, five_indices), (0, 14 - rightmost(five_indices))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Indices:** Identify the indices of all cells containing the digit '5' (`five_indices`).
2. **Clear Target Cells:** Fill the identified cells with the background color (0) (`O`).
3. **Shift and Paint:**  Shift the '5' indices to the right edge, recolor them to 5, and paint them onto the cleared grid (`O`).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  five_patch = extract(partition(I), lambda p: color(p) == 5)
  offset = (0, 14 - rightmost(five_patch))
  O = paint(cover(I, five_patch), shift(five_patch, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Target Patch:** Partition the grid into single-color patches and extract the patch containing '5' (`five_patch`).
2. **Calculate Offset:**  Determine the offset required to move the patch to the right edge (`offset`).
3. **Cover, Shift, and Paint:**  Cover the original patch with the background color, then shift and paint the extracted patch to its new position, generating the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  fives = asobject(replace(I, 5, 1))
  other = asobject(replace(I, 5, 0))
  shifted = shift(fives, (0, 14 - rightmost(fives)))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), other), shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate '5's and Others:** Create separate object representations for '5's and all other digits (`fives`, `other`).
2. **Shift '5' Object:**  Shift the '5' object to the right edge (`shifted`).
3. **Construct Output:** Build the output grid `O` by painting 'other' onto a blank canvas, followed by painting the 'shifted' '5' object.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. They showcase different approaches to object manipulation, index manipulation, and grid construction, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
