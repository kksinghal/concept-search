## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the object made of the digit '5' to a new location relative to the object made of the digit '2'.  Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The '5' object moves to the right of the '2' object, aligning with the top of the '2' object.

**Input_1:** The '5' object moves to the right of the '2' object and centers vertically beside the '2' object.

**Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, the '5' object moves to the right of the '2' object and centers vertically beside it.

**Overall Logic:**

The transformation consistently repositions the '5' object to the right of the '2' object. The vertical positioning varies, either aligning with the top or the vertical center of the '2' object.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for the "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objs, 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objs, 5))
  target_pos = (uppermost(obj2), rightmost(obj2) + 1) 
  moved_obj5 = shift(obj5, subtract(target_pos, ulcorner(obj5)))
  O = paint(paint(I, obj2), moved_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  The code identifies the objects formed by digits '2' and '5' in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Target Position:** It determines the target position for the '5' object - one column to the right of the rightmost '2' cell, aligned with the top of the '2' object.
3. **Shift '5' Object:** The '5' object is shifted to the target position.
4. **Paint Objects:** The original '2' object and the shifted '5' object are painted onto a blank canvas, effectively moving the '5' object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  h_offset = rightmost(obj2) - leftmost(obj5) + 1
  v_offset = uppermost(obj2) - uppermost(obj5)
  O = paint(I, shift(obj5, (v_offset, h_offset)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to version 1, the code identifies the objects formed by '2' and '5'.
2. **Calculate Offsets:** It calculates the horizontal and vertical offsets needed to move the '5' object next to the '2' object.
3. **Shift and Paint:**  The '5' object is shifted by the calculated offsets, and the shifted object is painted directly onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objs, 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objs, 5))
  new_obj5 = shift(
      obj5, 
      (uppermost(obj2) - uppermost(obj5), rightmost(obj2) - leftmost(obj5) + 1)
  )
  O = paint(paint(I, obj2), new_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly calculates the shift amounts within the `shift` function, making it more concise. It first identifies objects like the previous versions and then calculates the row and column differences to directly shift the '5' object to the right of the '2' object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  target = (uppermost(obj2), rightmost(obj2) + 1)
  O = paint(
      I, 
      frozenset(
          (v, add(index, subtract(target, ulcorner(obj5)))) 
          for v, index in obj5
      )
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly modifies the indices of the '5' object. It calculates the target position and then iterates over each cell of the '5' object, adjusting its position relative to the target and the original top-left corner of the '5' object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  return paint(I, shift(obj5, subtract((uppermost(obj2), rightmost(obj2) + 1), ulcorner(obj5))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version further simplifies the code by combining several operations. It directly paints the shifted '5' object onto the input grid. The shift amount is calculated inline by subtracting the top-left corner of the '5' object from the target position (to the right of the '2' object).

These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each leverages different function combinations and logic flow, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
