## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '5' and moving them to a new location within the grid. The movement is specific to each '5' object and is not a uniform translation across all objects. 

Let's break down the movement for each example:

**Input_0:**

* The '5' object is moved from the middle-right to the top center.

**Input_1:**

* The '5' object is split into two identical objects.
* One object remains in its original position.
* The other object is moved to the left edge, mirroring its original vertical position. 

**Input_2:**

* The '5' object is moved to the left edge, mirroring its original vertical position and retaining its original shape. 


## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL from `dsl.py` to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5)
  O = I
  for obj in fives:
    new_obj = shift(obj, subtract((2,7),centerofmass(obj)))
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5' Objects:**  `colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5)` isolates objects formed by the digit '5'.
2. **Iterate and Move:**  The code iterates through each identified '5' object.
3. **Calculate Offset:** `subtract((2,7),centerofmass(obj))` determines the offset needed to move the object's center of mass to coordinate (2,7).
4. **Shift and Paint:** The object is shifted using the calculated offset and painted onto a copy of the input grid (`O`) where the original object was erased. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)
  O = fill(I, 0, five_indices)
  for i, j in five_indices:
    new_i = 2 + abs(6-i) 
    O = paint(O, {(5, (new_i, j))})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' Indices:**  `ofcolor(I, 5)` retrieves the indices of all cells containing '5'.
2. **Clear '5' Cells:** `fill(I, 0, five_indices)` creates a copy of the input with '5' cells replaced by '0'.
3. **Calculate New Row:** `new_i = 2 + abs(6-i)` calculates the new row index for each '5' cell, effectively mirroring it across row 6.
4. **Paint at New Location:** Each '5' cell is painted at its new location on the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shift(five_obj, subtract((2,7),centerofmass(five_obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is a simplification of Version 1, assuming there's only one '5' object.

1. **Get the '5' Object:** `first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))` gets the single '5' object.
2. **Calculate Offset, Shift, and Paint:** This part is identical to Version 1, moving the object based on its center of mass.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target = (2,7) 
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)
  O = fill(I, 0, five_indices)
  for i, j in five_indices:
    new_location = add((i,j), gravitate({(0, (i, j))}, {(0, target)}))
    O = paint(O, {(5, new_location)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `gravitate` function for movement.

1. **Define Target:** `target = (2,7)` sets the destination point.
2. **Find '5' Indices and Clear:** Similar to Version 2.
3. **Calculate Movement:** `gravitate({(0, (i, j))}, {(0, target)}))` calculates the direction and magnitude to move each '5' cell towards the target. 
4. **Apply Movement and Paint:**  The movement is applied to the original indices, and the '5' is painted at the new location.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  h, w = shape(five_obj)
  target_ulcorner = (2, 7 - w // 2)
  O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shift(five_obj, subtract(target_ulcorner, ulcorner(five_obj)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on aligning the upper-left corner of the '5' object with a target location.

1. **Get the '5' Object and Dimensions:**  Get the object and its height and width.
2. **Calculate Target Corner:** Determine the target location for the object's upper-left corner.
3. **Calculate Offset, Shift, and Paint:** Similar to previous versions, calculate the offset, shift the object, and paint it onto the modified grid. 

## Note:

These programs are tailored to the specific examples provided. If the transformation logic in unseen examples differs, you might need to adjust these programs using other DSL functions and logic.
