## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the objects made of the digit '5' in the input grid to specific locations in the output grid, while leaving other digits unchanged.

* **Horizontal Movement:** The '5' objects are moved horizontally towards the right edge of the grid.
* **Vertical Movement:** The '5' objects are also shifted vertically, their final vertical position depends on their original position in the input grid.

**Specific Observations:**

* **Input_0:** The top '5' object moves to the right edge and up by one row. The middle '5' object moves to the right edge and down by two rows. The bottom '5' object moves to the right edge and down by three rows.
* **Input_1:** The '5' objects move to the right edge. Each '5' object shifts down by a number of rows equal to its original row index.
* **Input_2:**  Similar to Input_1, the '5' objects move to the right edge and shift down. The amount of downward shift for each '5' object is again determined by its original row index.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  fives = colorfilter(objs, 5)
  moved_fives = frozenset(
      shift(obj, (i - uppermost(obj), 14 - rightmost(obj)))
      for i, obj in enumerate(fives)
  )
  O = paint(cover(I, merge(fives)), merge(moved_fives))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Filter '5' Objects:** Extract objects consisting only of the digit '5' using `colorfilter(objs, 5)`.
3. **Calculate Movement:** For each '5' object, calculate the horizontal and vertical shift based on its position.
4. **Move Objects:** Move the '5' objects to their new positions using `shift(obj, (vertical_shift, horizontal_shift))`.
5. **Combine and Paint:** Combine the moved '5' objects and paint them onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = asobject(replace(I, 5, 1))
  other = asobject(replace(I, 5, 0))
  shifted_fives = frozenset(
      shift(obj, (i - uppermost(obj), 14 - rightmost(obj))) 
      for i, obj in enumerate(objects(fives, True, False, True))
  )
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), other), merge(shifted_fives))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Separate '5's:** Replace '5's with '1's and everything else with '0's to isolate them.
2. **Create Objects:** Convert the isolated '5's (now '1's) into objects.
3. **Calculate and Apply Shifts:** Similar to Version 1, calculate and apply the shifts to each '5' object.
4. **Reconstruct:** Paint the original non-'5' elements and the shifted '5' objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 5:
        O = move(O, {(5, (i, j))}, (i - j, 14 - j))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Move:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Move '5's:** If a cell contains a '5', it's moved to its new location based on its row and column index.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = partition(replace(I, 5, 1))[1]
  other = asobject(replace(I, 5, 0))
  shifted_fives = frozenset(
      (5, (i, 14 - len(I) + i)) 
      for i, j in sorted(toindices(fives), key=lambda x: x[0])
  )
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), other), shifted_fives)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate and Partition:** Isolate '5's, partition the grid into objects, and extract the '5' object.
2. **Calculate New Positions:** Calculate the new positions of the '5' cells based on their row indices.
3. **Reconstruct:** Similar to Version 2, reconstruct the output by painting non-'5' elements and shifted '5's.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = asobject(replace(I, 5, 1))
  other = asobject(replace(I, 5, 0))
  shifted_fives = frozenset()
  for obj in objects(fives, True, False, True):
    i = uppermost(obj)
    shifted_fives |= shift(obj, (i - uppermost(obj), 14 - rightmost(obj)))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), other), shifted_fives)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate and Form Objects:** Similar to previous versions, isolate '5's and convert them into objects.
2. **Iterate and Shift:** Iterate through each '5' object and calculate its shift based on its position.
3. **Reconstruct Output:** Similar to other versions, reconstruct the output by combining non-'5' elements with shifted '5's on a blank canvas.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, leveraging various DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a distinct way to solve the problem, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
