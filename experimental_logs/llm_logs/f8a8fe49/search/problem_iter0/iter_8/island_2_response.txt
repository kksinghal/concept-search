## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the object composed of the digit '5' to border the object composed of the digit '2'. Specifically, the '5' object is moved to the right of the '2' object, aligning their top edges. 

**Let's break down the movement of the '5' object based on the examples:**

* **Example 0:** The '5' object is moved horizontally to the right, aligning with the top edge of the '2' object.
* **Example 1:** Similar to Example 0, the '5' object is moved horizontally to the right, aligning with the top edge of the '2' object.
* **Example 2:** This example showcases that the movement is not simply aligning centers but specifically aligning the top edges, as the '5' object is shifted upwards slightly compared to Example 1.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program in the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  hdiff = height(obj2) - height(obj5)
  wdiff = width(obj2)
  shift_amount = (0, wdiff)
  moved_obj5 = shift(obj5, shift_amount)
  O = paint(paint(I, obj2), moved_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The program first identifies the objects composed of '2' (obj2) and '5' (obj5) using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
2. **Calculate Shift:** The difference in width between the '2' object and '5' object (`wdiff`) is calculated to determine the horizontal shift required.
3. **Shift Object:** The '5' object (`obj5`) is shifted rightwards by `wdiff` using the `shift` function. 
4. **Paint Objects:** Finally, the '2' object and the shifted '5' object are painted onto a blank canvas using the `paint` function to produce the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  target_loc = add(urcorner(obj2), (0, 1))
  shift_amount = subtract(target_loc, ulcorner(obj5))
  moved_obj5 = shift(obj5, shift_amount)
  O = paint(paint(I, obj2), moved_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, the program identifies `obj2` and `obj5`.
2. **Calculate Target Location:** The target location for the upper-left corner of the '5' object is determined as one position to the right of the upper-right corner of the '2' object (`target_loc`).
3. **Calculate Shift:** The `subtract` function calculates the required shift to move the '5' object to the `target_loc`.
4. **Shift Object & Paint:** The '5' object is shifted, and both objects are painted onto a blank canvas to create the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  new_obj5 = toobject(shift(toindices(obj5), subtract((0, leftmost(obj5)), (0, rightmost(obj2) + 1))), I)
  O = paint(paint(I, obj2), new_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The program identifies `obj2` and `obj5`.
2. **Calculate Shift:** This version calculates the shift directly within the `shift` function by finding the difference between the '5' object's leftmost position and the desired position (one cell to the right of the '2' object's rightmost position).
3. **Shift & Reconstruct Object:** The `toindices` function extracts the indices of the '5' object, which are then shifted. The `toobject` function reconstructs the object from the shifted indices, using values from the input grid.
4. **Paint Objects:** The objects are painted onto the canvas to produce the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  shift_amount = (uppermost(obj2) - uppermost(obj5), width(obj2))
  moved_obj5 = shift(obj5, shift_amount)
  O = paint(paint(I, obj2), moved_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, `obj2` and `obj5` are identified.
2. **Calculate Shift:** This version explicitly calculates both horizontal and vertical shifts. The horizontal shift is the width of the '2' object, and the vertical shift aligns the top edges of both objects.
3. **Shift Object & Paint:**  The '5' object is shifted, and both objects are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  moved_obj5 = toobject(prapply(lambda i, j: (i + uppermost(obj2) - uppermost(obj5), j + rightmost(obj2) + 1), range(height(obj5)), range(width(obj5))), I)
  O = paint(paint(I, obj2), moved_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The program identifies `obj2` and `obj5`.
2. **Calculate Shift and Reconstruct:** This version employs the `prapply` function to simultaneously calculate new indices for each cell of the '5' object. The lambda function within `prapply` handles the shift calculation for each cell, aligning it with the top edge and right side of the '2' object. 
3. **Paint Objects:**  The '2' object and the shifted '5' object are painted onto a blank canvas.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same outcome, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version focuses on different aspects of the transformation logic, offering unique combinations of DSL functions.
