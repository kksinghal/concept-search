## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of the digit '5' within the input grid and moving them to the right edge of the grid. The objects are moved without changing their shape or orientation, and they are placed as close as possible to their original vertical position. 

**Specific Observations:**

* **Object Preservation:** The '5' objects retain their original shape and structure during the transformation.
* **Right Alignment:** The '5' objects are aligned to the right edge of the grid.
* **Vertical Position:**  While shifted horizontally, the '5' objects maintain their relative vertical positioning as much as possible. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(replace(I, 5, 1), True, False, True)  # Identify '5' objects
  shifted_objs = (shift(obj, (len(I[0]) - rightmost(obj) - 1, 0)) for obj in objs)  # Shift each object to the right
  return paint(replace(I, 5, 0), merge(shifted_objs))  # Paint shifted objects onto a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5' Objects:**  We first replace all occurrences of '5' with '1' and then use the `objects` function to find all connected components of '1's, representing the original '5' objects. 
2. **Shift to the Right:** For each identified object, we calculate the shift amount needed to align its rightmost point with the right edge of the grid and then use the `shift` function to move it.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** Finally, we create a blank canvas using `replace(I, 5, 0)` (replacing all '5's with the background color) and paint the shifted objects onto it using `paint` and `merge`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      replace(I, 5, 0),  # Create blank canvas
      merge(shift(recolor(5, obj), (len(I[0]) - rightmost(obj) - 1, 0)) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 5)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:**  Similar to Version 1, we begin by creating a blank canvas.
2. **Filter and Shift:** This version directly iterates through all objects in the input grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`. For each object, we check if its color is '5' using `color(obj) == 5`. If it is, we recolor it to '5' using `recolor(5, obj)`, calculate the rightward shift, and apply it using `shift`.
3. **Paint and Merge:** Finally, we merge all the shifted objects and paint them onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = ofcolor(I, 5)  # Get indices of all '5's
  shifted_fives = frozenset((i, len(I[0]) - 1 - j) for i, j in fives)  # Calculate new indices after shifting
  return paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(5, shifted_fives))  # Paint onto a blank canvas 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' Indices:** We directly extract the indices of all cells containing '5' using `ofcolor(I, 5)`.
2. **Calculate Shifted Indices:**  For each '5' index, we calculate its new column position after the shift, keeping the row index the same.
3. **Paint Shifted '5's:** We create a blank canvas and directly paint the '5's at their new positions using `paint` and `recolor`.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      replace(I, 5, 0),  # Blank canvas
      merge(
          shift(
              {(5, (i, j))}, (len(I[0]) - j - 1, 0)
          )
          for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 5
      )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Shift:**  This version iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains '5', it creates a single-cell object at that location and calculates its shift amount to reach the right edge.
2. **Paint and Merge:**  The shifted single-cell objects are then merged and painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          5 if 5 in row[j:] else 0 
          for j in range(len(row))
      ) 
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version directly manipulates the grid data structure. It iterates through each row and within each row, it checks for the presence of '5' from the current cell onwards.
2. **Shift within Row:** If a '5' is found, it fills the current cell with '5'; otherwise, it fills it with '0'.  This effectively shifts the '5's within each row to the right edge. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the transformation task within the DSL constraints. Each utilizes distinct logic and combinations of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL.
