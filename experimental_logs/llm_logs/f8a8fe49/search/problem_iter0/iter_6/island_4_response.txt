## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three input-output pairs aims to move the object made of digit '5' to the right edge of the object made of digit '2', vertically aligning their centers. 

Let's break down each example:

**Input 0:** The '5' object is moved upwards to align with the '2' object's center and then shifted to the right edge of the '2' object.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, the '5' object is vertically aligned with the '2' object and then moved to its right edge.

**Input 2:** Again, the '5' object is vertically aligned and placed on the right edge of the '2' object.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  v_offset = center(obj2)[0] - center(obj5)[0]
  h_offset = rightmost(obj2) - leftmost(obj5) + 1
  return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj2), shift(obj5, (v_offset, h_offset)))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify and extract the objects formed by digits '2' and '5' from the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Offsets:** Calculate the vertical (`v_offset`) and horizontal (`h_offset`) distances needed to move the '5' object to the desired location. 
3. **Shift and Paint:** Create a blank canvas, paint the '2' object in its original position, and then paint the '5' object after shifting it by the calculated offsets.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj5_shifted = shift(obj5, (center(obj2)[0] - center(obj5)[0], rightmost(obj2) - leftmost(obj5) + 1))
  return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj2), obj5_shifted) 

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Extract objects formed by '2' and '5' from the input grid.
2. **Calculate Shift:** Determine the shift amount for the '5' object to be positioned correctly.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Create a blank canvas, paint the original '2' object, then paint the shifted '5' object onto the canvas.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  return paint(
      paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj2),
      shift(obj5, add(subtract(center(obj2), center(obj5)), (0, 1)))
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Extract objects formed by '2' and '5'.
2. **Compute Shift:**  Calculate the shift needed for alignment using vector operations.
3. **Shift and Combine:** Create a blank canvas, place the '2' object, then position the shifted '5' object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  return paint(
      paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj2),
      shift(obj5, (center(obj2)[0] - center(obj5)[0], rightmost(obj2) - leftmost(obj5) + 1)) 
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Isolate the objects composed of '2' and '5' from the grid.
2. **Shift Calculation:** Determine the shift required for the '5' object to be correctly placed.
3. **Combine on Canvas:**  On a new canvas, position the '2' object, followed by placing the shifted '5' object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objs, 2))
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objs, 5))
  return paint(
      paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj2),
      shift(obj5, (center(obj2)[0]-center(obj5)[0], rightmost(obj2)-leftmost(obj5)+1))
  )

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate Objects:** Extract the objects formed by the digits '2' and '5' from the input grid.
2. **Determine Shift:** Calculate the amount by which the '5' object needs to be shifted.
3. **Position on Canvas:** Create a new canvas, place the '2' object at its original location, and then place the '5' object after applying the calculated shift. 

Each program version utilizes different combinations of DSL functions while achieving the same transformation goal. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
