## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the shape formed by the digit '5' and mirroring it across a vertical axis located at the center of the grid. The mirrored shape is then painted back onto the grid, replacing any existing digits in those positions.

**Example:**

In `Input_0`, the '5' shape is located on the right side of the grid. The transformation mirrors this shape to the left side of the grid, resulting in `Output_0`. The same logic applies to `Input_1` and `Input_2`, with the mirrored '5' shape being placed symmetrically across the vertical center line.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  center_j = len(I[0]) // 2
  shift_amount = (center_j - 1) - rightmost(obj_5)
  mirrored_obj = hmirror(shift(obj_5, (0, 2 * shift_amount)))
  O = paint(I, mirrored_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Isolate:** The code first identifies the object composed of the digit '5' using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
2. **Calculate Shift:** It then calculates the horizontal distance (`shift_amount`) needed to move the object so that its rightmost edge aligns with the vertical center line of the grid.
3. **Mirror and Position:** The object is then mirrored horizontally using `hmirror` and shifted to its final position on the left side of the grid. 
4. **Paint:** Finally, the mirrored object is painted onto the original grid (`I`) using the `paint` function, resulting in the final output (`O`).

**Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  center_j = len(I[0]) // 2
  mirrored_obj = frozenset((v, (i, 2 * center_j - j - 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj_5) 
  O = paint(I, mirrored_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object:** Similar to Version 1, the object made of '5's is identified.
2. **Direct Mirroring:** Instead of shifting and mirroring, this version directly calculates the mirrored indices of each cell in the object using the formula `2 * center_j - j - 1` for the column index.
3. **Paint:** The mirrored object is then painted onto the original grid to produce the output.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  left_grid = crop(I, (0, 0), (len(I), len(I[0]) // 2))
  right_grid = hmirror(left_grid)
  O = hconcat(left_grid, right_grid)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object (Implicit):** This version implicitly uses the knowledge that the '5' object is always on the right side of the grid. 
2. **Split and Mirror:** It splits the grid into two halves vertically. The left half is kept as is, and the right half is mirrored horizontally.
3. **Concatenate:** The two halves are then concatenated back together to form the final output.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  indices_5 = toindices(obj_5)
  mirrored_indices = frozenset((i, len(I[0]) - j - 1) for i, j in indices_5)
  O = fill(I, 5, mirrored_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object and Indices:** Similar to other versions, it finds the '5' object. Then it extracts just the indices of the object cells.
2. **Mirror Indices:**  It directly mirrors the indices of the '5' object across the vertical center line.
3. **Fill:**  Instead of painting an entire object, this version directly fills the mirrored indices with the value '5' on the original grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  O = I
  for v, (i, j) in obj_5:
    O = paint(O, {(v, (i, len(I[0]) - j - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object:**  It identifies the '5' object.
2. **Iterative Painting:** This version iterates through each cell of the '5' object. For each cell, it calculates the mirrored index and paints that single cell onto a copy of the original grid. 

These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic.
