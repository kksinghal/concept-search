## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the object made of '5's, removing it from its original location, and painting it around the object made of '2's. Let's break down the movement for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The '5' object moves up and slightly to the right, centering itself horizontally with the top of the '2' object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The '5' object rotates 90 degrees counter-clockwise and positions itself to the right of the '2' object, aligning its center horizontally with the '2' object's center. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  The '5' object rotates 90 degrees counter-clockwise and positions itself to the right of the '2' object, aligning its bottom with the '2' object's top.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  target_row = uppermost(obj_2) - height(obj_5)
  target_col = leftmost(obj_2) + width(obj_2)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, (target_row - uppermost(obj_5), target_col - leftmost(obj_5))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Find the objects composed of '5's (obj_5) and '2's (obj_2).
2. **Calculate Target Position:** Determine the target position's upper-left corner for the '5' object. The target row is above the '2' object, and the target column is immediately to the right of the '2' object.
3. **Move and Paint:** Remove the '5' object from its original position, shift it to the target location, and paint it onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, (uppermost(obj_2) - height(obj_5) - uppermost(obj_5), rightmost(obj_2) - leftmost(obj_5))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Locate the objects formed by '5's and '2's.
2. **Calculate Offset:** Directly compute the offset required to move the '5' object to its target position relative to its current position.
3. **Move and Paint:** Erase the '5' object, shift it using the calculated offset, and draw it at its new location.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  row_offset = uppermost(obj_2) - height(obj_5) - uppermost(obj_5)
  col_offset = rightmost(obj_2) - leftmost(obj_5)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, (row_offset, col_offset)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** Identify the objects made of '5's and '2's.
2. **Determine Offsets:**  Separately calculate the vertical and horizontal offsets needed to reposition the '5' object.
3. **Shift and Draw:**  Clear the '5' object, move it using the calculated offsets, and paint it in its final position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  two = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  shift_amount = (uppermost(two) - height(five) - uppermost(five), rightmost(two) - leftmost(five))
  return paint(cover(I, five), shift(five, shift_amount))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Objects:**  Find the objects formed by '5's and '2's.
2. **Compute Shift:** Calculate the shift vector required to move the '5' object to its desired location.
3. **Apply Transformation:** Remove the '5' object, apply the shift to its position, and paint it onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  two = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  new_five = shift(five, (uppermost(two) - height(five) - uppermost(five), rightmost(two) - leftmost(five)))
  return paint(cover(I, five), new_five)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** Identify the objects composed of '5's and '2's.
2. **Create Shifted Object:** Calculate the shifted position of the '5' object and create a new object representing this position.
3. **Update Grid:** Remove the original '5' object and paint the shifted object onto the grid.
