## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves moving the object composed of the digit '5' relative to the object composed of the digit '2'. Let's break down the specific movement for each example:

**Example 0:** The '5' object is moved from its original position to be above the '2' object, maintaining its original orientation.

**Example 1:** The '5' object is moved to the left and right sides of the '2' object. The left '5' is vertically mirrored, while the right '5' retains its original orientation. 

**Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, the '5' object is moved to the left and right sides of the '2' object. However, in this case, both the left and right '5' objects are vertically mirrored. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  center_2 = center(obj_2)
  center_5 = center(obj_5)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, (center_2[0] - center_5[0], 2 * center_2[1] - center_5[1])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Find the objects formed by digits '5' and '2'.
2. **Calculate Centers:** Determine the center coordinates of both objects.
3. **Calculate Offset:** Calculate the offset needed to move the '5' object to the desired position relative to the '2' object.
4. **Move and Paint:** Erase the original '5' object, shift it by the calculated offset, and paint it back onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  v_offset =  uppermost(obj_2) - lowermost(obj_5) - 1 
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, (v_offset, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Find the objects formed by digits '5' and '2'.
2. **Calculate Vertical Offset:** Determine the vertical offset to place the '5' object directly above the '2' object.
3. **Move and Paint:** Erase the original '5' object, shift it vertically by the calculated offset, and paint it back onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  h_offset =  width(obj_2) + 1
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(hmirror(obj_5), (0, h_offset)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Find the objects formed by digits '5' and '2'.
2. **Calculate Horizontal Offset:** Determine the horizontal offset to position the mirrored '5' object to the right of the '2' object.
3. **Mirror, Move, and Paint:**  Erase the original '5' object, mirror it horizontally, shift it horizontally by the calculated offset, and paint it back onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  center_2 = center(obj_2)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, (center_2[0] - uppermost(obj_5) - height(obj_5) // 2, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Find the objects formed by digits '5' and '2'.
2. **Calculate Centers:**  Determine the center coordinate of the '2' object.
3. **Calculate Offset:**  Calculate the vertical offset required to align the center of the '5' object with the center of the '2' object. 
4. **Move and Paint:**  Erase the original '5' object, shift it vertically by the calculated offset, and paint it back onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(vmirror(obj_5), (uppermost(obj_2) - lowermost(obj_5) - 1, width(obj_2) + 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find the objects formed by digits '5' and '2'.
2. **Calculate Offsets:**  Determine the vertical and horizontal offsets required to position the mirrored '5' object to the right of the '2' object.
3. **Mirror, Move, and Paint:**  Erase the original '5' object, mirror it vertically, shift it by the calculated offsets, and paint it back onto the grid.
