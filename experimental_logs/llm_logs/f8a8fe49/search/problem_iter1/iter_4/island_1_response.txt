## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently moves the object made of digit '5' to a new position relative to the object made of digit '2'. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The '5' object is moved two rows above its original position.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** The '5' object is moved one column to the left and three rows above its original position.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** The '5' object is moved one column to the left and two rows above its original position.

Based on these observations, the transformation can be generalized as follows:

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identify the objects formed by digits '2' and '5' in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Offset:** Determine the desired vertical and horizontal offset for the '5' object relative to the '2' object. 
3. **Move Object:** Move the '5' object to its new position based on the calculated offset.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  offset = subtract(ulcorner(obj_2), ulcorner(obj_5))
  offset = (offset[0] - 2, offset[1])
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `colorfilter` and `objects` to locate the objects formed by digits '2' and '5'.
2. **Calculate Offset:**  We calculate the difference between the upper-left corner indices of the '2' and '5' objects using `subtract`.  We then adjust the vertical offset by subtracting 2.
3. **Move Object:** The '5' object is first removed from the input grid using `cover`, then shifted to its new position based on the calculated offset with `shift`, and finally painted onto the modified grid using `paint`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  center_2 = centerofmass(obj_2)
  center_5 = centerofmass(obj_5)
  offset = (center_2[0] - center_5[0] - 2, center_2[1] - center_5[1])
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Calculate Offset:** We calculate the offset using the center of mass of both objects using `centerofmass` and adjust the vertical component by subtracting 2. 
3. **Move Object:** Same as in Version 1.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  offset = gravitate(obj_5, obj_2)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, (offset[0] - 2, offset[1])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Calculate Offset:** We use the `gravitate` function to get the direction and magnitude to move the '5' object adjacent to the '2' object. We further adjust the vertical offset by subtracting 2.
3. **Move Object:** Same as in Version 1.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  pos = position(obj_5, obj_2)
  offset = (pos[0] - 2, pos[1])
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, offset))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Calculate Offset:** We use the `position` function to get the relative position of the '5' object to the '2' object. Based on this relative position, we calculate the required offset, again adjusting the vertical component by 2.
3. **Move Object:** Same as in Version 1.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  h, w = shape(I)
  target = (uppermost(obj_2) - 2, leftmost(obj_2) + width(obj_2) // 2 - width(obj_5) // 2)
  offset = (target[0] - uppermost(obj_5), target[1] - leftmost(obj_5))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Calculate Offset:**  We calculate the target upper-left corner of the '5' object by considering the upper-left corner and width of the '2' object and the width of the '5' object. Then, we calculate the offset based on the current and target positions of the '5' object.
3. **Move Object:** Same as in Version 1.
