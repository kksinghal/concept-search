## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the object with color '5', performing a specific movement and mirroring. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The '5'-object is moved from the right side to the top center of the grid while being mirrored vertically.

**Pair 1:**  The '5'-object is moved from the center-right to the left and right sides of the '2'-object. It's also mirrored vertically.

**Pair 2:** Similar to Pair 1, the '5'-object moves to flank the '2'-object on the left and right sides but starts from a slightly different position. It's mirrored vertically as well.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  center_2 = center(obj_2)
  shift_amount = (center_2[0] - center(obj_5)[0], center_2[1] - center(obj_5)[1])
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(vmirror(obj_5), shift_amount))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find the objects composed of '5' and '2' using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
2. **Find Center:** Determine the center coordinates of the '2'-object using `center`.
3. **Calculate Shift:** Calculate the required shift to move the '5'-object to the desired position relative to the '2'-object.
4. **Mirror and Shift:** Mirror the '5'-object vertically using `vmirror` and then shift it to the calculated position using `shift`.
5. **Paint:**  Paint the mirrored and shifted '5'-object onto a blank canvas created by covering the original '5'-object in the input grid (`cover` and `paint`).

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  target_pos = (uppermost(obj_2)-height(obj_5)-1, leftmost(obj_2) + width(obj_2) // 2 - width(obj_5) // 2)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(vmirror(obj_5), target_pos))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Calculate Target:** Calculate the target position's upper-left corner for the '5'-object based on the dimensions and position of the '2'-object.
3. **Mirror and Shift:** Mirror the '5'-object vertically and shift it to the calculated target position.
4. **Paint:** Paint the transformed '5'-object onto the grid after removing the original one.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  offset = gravitate(obj_5, obj_2)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(vmirror(obj_5), (offset[0] - 1, offset[1])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Gravitate:** Calculate the direction and distance to move the '5'-object to be adjacent to the '2'-object using `gravitate`.
3. **Adjust and Mirror:**  Adjust the vertical component of the calculated offset for precise positioning and mirror the '5'-object vertically.
4. **Paint:** Paint the transformed '5'-object onto the cleared grid.

### Program Version 4: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  center_5 = center(obj_5)
  center_2 = center(obj_2)
  h_shift = center_2[1] - center_5[1]
  v_shift =  (uppermost(obj_2) - 1) - lowermost(obj_5)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(vmirror(obj_5), (v_shift, h_shift)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Centers:** Identify the '5' and '2' objects and calculate their centers.
2. **Calculate Shifts:** Calculate the horizontal and vertical shifts required to position the '5' object above the '2' object.
3. **Mirror and Shift:** Mirror the '5' object vertically and apply the calculated shifts.
4. **Paint:** Paint the transformed '5' object onto the grid after removing the original '5' object.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  obj_2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  ref_point = (lowermost(obj_5), center(obj_5)[1])
  target_point = (uppermost(obj_2) - 1, center(obj_2)[1])
  shift_amount = subtract(target_point, ref_point)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(vmirror(obj_5), shift_amount))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify the '5' and '2' objects.
2. **Define Reference & Target:**  Define a reference point on the '5' object (its bottom-center) and a target point above the '2' object (just above its top-center).
3. **Calculate Shift:**  Calculate the shift needed to move the reference point to the target point.
4. **Mirror and Shift:** Mirror the '5' object vertically and apply the calculated shift.
5. **Paint:**  Paint the transformed '5' object onto the grid after removing the original '5' object.


## Conclusion:

These five distinct versions utilize various DSL functions and approaches to achieve the same output. This highlights the flexibility and expressiveness of DSL in tackling spatial reasoning tasks, even within a limited set of functions.
