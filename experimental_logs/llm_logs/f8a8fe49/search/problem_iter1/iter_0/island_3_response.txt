## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve identifying the object made of '5's and moving it to the right edge of the grid, while maintaining the relative positions of other objects.

**Input 0:** The '5' object is moved from the center to the right edge, pushing the rightmost '2' object further right.

**Input 1 & 2:** Similar to input 0, the '5' object is moved to the right edge. The '2' object on the right is also shifted right, illustrating that the transformation maintains the relative spatial relationships between objects.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  left = crop(I, (0, 0), (len(I), leftmost(obj_5)))
  right = crop(I, (0, leftmost(obj_5)), (len(I), len(I[0]) - leftmost(obj_5)))
  O = hconcat(left, right)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate '5' object:** Identify the object composed of '5's using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
2. **Split the grid:** Divide the grid vertically into two parts: 'left' containing everything to the left of the '5' object and 'right' containing the '5' object and everything to its right.
3. **Recombine:** Concatenate the 'left' and 'right' parts horizontally, effectively moving the '5' object to the right edge.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  shift_amount = (len(I[0]) - 1) - rightmost(obj_5)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shift(obj_5, (0, shift_amount)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '5' object:** Similar to Version 1, identify the object made of '5's.
2. **Calculate shift:** Determine the required horizontal shift to move the rightmost point of the '5' object to the right edge of the grid.
3. **Move and paint:** "Erase" the '5' object from its original position using `cover`, then paint it back at its new location calculated by shifting it by `shift_amount`. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  O = paint(I, shift(obj_5, (0, (len(I[0]) - 1) - rightmost(obj_5))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic:

1. **Find '5' object:** Identify the object composed of '5's.
2. **Directly paint at the target:** Calculate the target location on the right edge and directly paint the '5' object there without explicitly erasing it from its original position. This leverages the fact that 'paint' will overwrite any existing values at the target location.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  target_col = len(I[0]) - width(obj_5)
  shifted_obj = shift(obj_5, (0, target_col - leftmost(obj_5)))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), shifted_obj)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '5' object and calculate target:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Shift object:** Calculate the shift amount to align the '5' object's left edge with the target column.
3. **Erase and paint:** Remove the original '5' object and paint the shifted object onto the grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj_5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
    empty_space = len(I[0]) - width(obj_5)
    O = hconcat(crop(I, (0, 0), (len(I), empty_space)), 
                crop(I, (0, empty_space), (len(I), width(obj_5))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' object and calculate empty space:** Identify the object and calculate the empty space to its left.
2. **Split and concatenate:** Divide the grid into two parts: one with the empty space and one with the '5' object. Then concatenate them to place the '5' object at the right edge.
