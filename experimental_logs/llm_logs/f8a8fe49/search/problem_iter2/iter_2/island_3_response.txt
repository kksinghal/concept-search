## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the object composed of the digit '5' to a new location based on the positions of other objects in the grid. 

**Logic:**

1. **Identify the '5' object:**  The program needs to locate the object made up of the digit '5'.
2. **Determine the target location:** The target location for the '5' object is calculated based on the position of the rightmost '2' object in the grid. 
3. **Calculate the offset:** The program needs to calculate the difference in position between the upper-left corner of the '5' object and the target location.
4. **Move the '5' object:**  The '5' object is moved to the target location using the calculated offset.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  rightmost_2s = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and rightmost(obj) == lrcorner(I)[1])
  target_2 = argmax(rightmost_2s, size) if rightmost_2s else ((2, (0,0)),)
  offset = subtract((uppermost(target_2), center(target_2)[1]), ulcorner(obj5))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), shift(obj5, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' object and rightmost '2' object:**  Similar to Program_A, this version identifies the '5' object and the rightmost '2' object.
2. **Calculate target position:**  It determines the target position's row as the uppermost row of the rightmost '2' object and the column as the center column of the rightmost '2' object.
3. **Calculate and apply offset:** It calculates the offset between the target position and the '5' object's upper-left corner and then shifts the '5' object by this offset.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  target_j = lrcorner(I)[1] // 2 
  target_i = uppermost(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and rightmost(obj) == lrcorner(I)[1]))
  offset = subtract((target_i, target_j), ulcorner(obj5))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), shift(obj5, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' object and target column:**  This version directly calculates the target column as the middle column of the input grid. It then finds the '5' object.
2. **Find target row:**  It extracts the rightmost '2' object and determines the target row as the uppermost row of this object.
3. **Calculate and apply offset:**  Similar to Version 1, it calculates the offset and moves the '5' object accordingly.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  target_loc = (uppermost(extract(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and rightmost(obj) == lrcorner(I)[1]), lambda obj: True)), lrcorner(I)[1] // 2)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), shift(obj5, subtract(target_loc, ulcorner(obj5))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' object and target location:**  This version combines the logic of finding the target row and column into a single step using nested functions. It first filters for the rightmost '2' object and then extracts the first object from this filtered set to find its uppermost row. The target column is calculated as half of the rightmost column index.
2. **Calculate and apply offset:** Similar to previous versions, it calculates and applies the offset to move the '5' object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
    target_i =  uppermost(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and any(j == lrcorner(I)[1] for i, j in toindices(obj))))
    target_j = lrcorner(I)[1] // 2
    O = paint(I, shift(obj5, (target_i - uppermost(obj5), target_j - leftmost(obj5))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' object, target row, and target column:**  This version finds the '5' object. It then finds the target row by extracting the object containing '2' that has the rightmost column index and then getting the uppermost row of that object.  The target column is calculated as half of the rightmost column index.
2. **Calculate and apply offset:** Similar to previous versions, it calculates and applies the offset to move the '5' object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5))
  all_2s = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  rightmost_2 = argmax(all_2s, rightmost)
  target_row = uppermost(rightmost_2)
  target_col = center(rightmost_2)[1]
  offset = (target_row - uppermost(obj5), target_col - leftmost(obj5))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), shift(obj5, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' object and rightmost '2' object:**  This version first identifies all objects composed of '2's. It then determines the rightmost '2' object by finding the object with the maximum rightmost index. 
2. **Calculate target position and offset:**  The target row is set as the uppermost row of the rightmost '2' object. The target column is set as the center column of the rightmost '2' object. Finally, it calculates the offset between the target position and the upper-left corner of the '5' object.
3. **Move the '5' object:** The '5' object is moved to the target location by shifting it using the calculated offset.
