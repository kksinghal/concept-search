## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking the input grids to the output grids can be described as follows:

1. **Object Isolation:** Each unique digit in the input grid is treated as a distinct object.

2. **Columnar Reordering:**  Within each row of the grid, the objects (digits) are reordered. The reordering prioritizes placing non-zero digits first, followed by zeros. However, the relative order of the non-zero digits is maintained.

3. **Zero Shifting:** After reordering, any remaining zeros within a row are shifted to the rightmost columns.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(x for x in row if x != mostcommon(row)) + repeat(mostcommon(row), row.count(mostcommon(row)))
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** The program iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.

2. **Identify & Separate Non-Most Common:** For each row, it identifies the most common element (which will always be 0 in these examples) using `mostcommon(row)`.  It then constructs a new row by first including all elements that are *not* the most common element.

3. **Append Most Common:**  The `repeat(mostcommon(row), row.count(mostcommon(row)))` part appends the most common element (0) to the end of the row, effectively shifting the zeros to the right.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(sorted(row, key=lambda x: x == 0))
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:**  Similar to Version 1, the code iterates through each row.

2. **Custom Sorting:**  It utilizes the `sorted` function with a custom key. The `key=lambda x: x == 0` sorts the elements based on whether they are equal to 0. Since `False` (0 not equal to 0) comes before `True` (0 equal to 0) during sorting,  the non-zero elements are placed before the zeros.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(x for x in row if x) + tuple(x for x in row if not x)
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** Iterates through each row of the input grid.

2. **Filter & Concatenate:** For each row, it creates two separate tuples:
    * One containing non-zero elements (`if x`).
    * One containing zero elements (`if not x`).
   These tuples are then concatenated, effectively shifting zeros to the right.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(v for k in sfilter(set(row), lambda x: x != 0) for v in repeat(k, row.count(k))) + 
      tuple(0 for _ in range(row.count(0))) 
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:**  Iterates over each row in the input grid `I`.

2. **Extract Non-Zero Elements:** Extracts the set of unique non-zero elements from the row using `sfilter` and `set(row)`.

3. **Repeat & Concatenate:** For each unique non-zero element `k`, it repeats it `row.count(k)` times and concatenates these repetitions. 

4. **Append Zeros:** Finally, it appends a tuple of zeros with a length equal to the count of zeros in the original row.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def reorder_row(row):
    non_zeros = tuple(x for x in row if x != 0)
    return non_zeros + (0,) * (len(row) - len(non_zeros))
  return tuple(reorder_row(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** Defines a helper function `reorder_row` to process individual rows.

2. **Iterate & Apply:**  Iterates through each row of the input grid `I` and applies the `reorder_row` function.

3. **Separate & Reconstruct:** Inside `reorder_row`:
   * Extracts non-zero elements into `non_zeros`.
   * Constructs a new row by concatenating `non_zeros` with a tuple of zeros of appropriate length.
