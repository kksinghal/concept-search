## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation sorts the non-zero elements within each row of the input grid, pushing them to the beginning of the row while maintaining their relative order. The remaining spaces in the row are then filled with zeros.

**Input 0:**
- The first row `5 0 0` remains unchanged as it's already sorted.
- The second row `3 5 0` is sorted to `5 3 0`.
- The third row `0 0 5` remains unchanged.

**Input 1:**
- The first row `5 0 0 0` remains unchanged.
- The second row `0 5 0 0` remains unchanged.
- The third row `6 0 5 0` is sorted to `6 5 0 0`.
- The fourth row `6 0 4 5` is sorted to `6 5 4 0`.

**Input 2:**
- The first row `5 0 0 0 0` remains unchanged.
- The second row `0 5 0 0 0` remains unchanged.
- The third row `8 8 5 0 0` is sorted to `8 8 5 0 0`.
- The fourth row `0 2 0 5 0` is sorted to `5 2 0 0 0`.
- The fifth row `0 2 0 1 5` is sorted to `5 2 1 0 0`.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(sorted(row, key=lambda x: (x == 0, x)))
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
This program utilizes the `sorted` function with a custom key to achieve the transformation. The `key` function prioritizes non-zero values by checking `x == 0`. This ensures all non-zero elements are placed before zeros while maintaining their order relative to each other.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(v for k in sorted(palette(row) - {0}) for v in repeat(k, colorcount(row, k))) 
      + repeat(0, width(row) - sum(1 for v in row if v != 0)) 
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
This version iterates through each row and extracts the non-zero colors (`palette(row) - {0}`). It then uses `repeat` and `colorcount` to create a tuple with the correct number of each color, effectively sorting them. Finally, it adds the necessary zeros at the end.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(v for k in sorted(set(row) - {0}) for v in repeat(k, row.count(k))) + repeat(0, len(row) - len(set(row) - {0}))
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**
This program iterates through each row and extracts the unique non-zero values (`set(row) - {0}`). It then uses `repeat` and `row.count` to construct a tuple with the correct number of each value in sorted order. Finally, it appends the necessary zeros.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = ()
  for row in I:
    newRow = tuple()
    for color in sorted(palette(row) - {0}):
      newRow += repeat(color, colorcount(row, color))
    newRow += repeat(0, width(row) - len(newRow))
    O += (newRow,)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This program iterates through each row, building a new row by iterating through the sorted non-zero colors and appending the correct number of each color using `repeat`. Finally, it appends the necessary zeros and adds the new row to the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(x for x in row if x != 0) + repeat(0, row.count(0))
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
This program takes a simpler approach by filtering and concatenating elements within each row. It first gathers all non-zero elements from the row and then appends the necessary number of zeros. This naturally achieves the desired sorting effect as the order of non-zero elements is maintained.
