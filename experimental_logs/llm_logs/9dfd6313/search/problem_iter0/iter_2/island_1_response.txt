## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation can be described as shifting each column of the input grid upwards such that the uppermost cell of each unique object in the column ends up at the top. 

**Example:**

Consider Input_1:

```
5 0 0 0
0 5 0 0
6 0 5 0
6 0 4 5
```

- **Column 1:** The object '6' is shifted upwards, resulting in '6 6 5 0'.
- **Column 2:** The object '5' is already at the top, remaining as '0 5 0 0'.
- **Column 3:** The objects '5' and '4' are shifted upwards, resulting in '0 0 5 4'.
- **Column 4:** The object '5' is already at the top, remaining as '0 0 0 5'.

This results in Output_1:

```
5 0 6 6
0 5 0 0
0 0 5 4
0 0 0 5
```


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(
    tuple(
      index(I, (i - j, k)) if index(I, (i - j, k)) is not None else 0 
      for j in range(i + 1)
    )[-1]
    for k in range(len(I[0]))
  for i in range(len(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** The outer loop iterates through each column `k` of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through rows in reverse:** For each column, the inner loop iterates through rows `i` in reverse order. 
3. **Shift upwards:** For each cell, it checks if a non-empty cell exists upwards in the same column by decrementing the row index `j` from the current row `i`. If found, it places that value in the current cell. Otherwise, it fills the cell with '0'.
4. **Construct output:** The process continues for all columns, constructing the final output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = rot90(I)
  x2 = apply(lambda c: tuple(v for v in c if v != 0) + tuple(0 for _ in range(len(c) - len([v for v in c if v != 0]))), x1)
  O = rot270(x2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate grid:** The input grid `I` is rotated 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90`.
2. **Process rows:**  Each row (originally a column) is processed. Non-zero values are shifted to the left, followed by filling the remaining spaces with zeros.
3. **Rotate back:** The processed grid is rotated 270 degrees clockwise using `rot270` to obtain the final output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(
    tuple(
      I[j][k] 
      for j in range(len(I)) if I[j][k] != 0
    ) + tuple(0 for _ in range(len(I) - len([I[j][k] for j in range(len(I)) if I[j][k] != 0])))
    for k in range(len(I[0]))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** The outer loop iterates through each column `k` of the input grid `I`.
2. **Extract non-zero values:** For each column, it extracts all non-zero values.
3. **Fill with zeros:**  It then appends zeros to the extracted values to match the original column length.
4. **Construct output:** This process is repeated for all columns, constructing the final output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in x1:
    x2 = ulcorner(obj)[1]
    x3 = shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0))
    O = paint(O, shift(x3, (0, x2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The program identifies all objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **Initialize canvas:** An empty canvas `O` is created with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Process objects:**  For each identified object:
    - Its column position `x2` is determined.
    - The object is shifted upwards until its top touches the top boundary.
    - The shifted object is then shifted horizontally to its original column position and painted onto the canvas.
4. **Return output:** The final canvas `O` becomes the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
        next((I[l][j] for l in range(i + 1) if I[l][j] != 0), 0) 
        for i in range(len(I))
      ) 
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:**  The outer loop iterates through each column `j` of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through rows:** For each column, the inner loop iterates through rows `i`.
3. **Find first non-zero value:** For each cell, it searches upwards in the same column for the first non-zero value. 
4. **Fill cell:** If a non-zero value is found, it's placed in the current cell. Otherwise, the cell is filled with a '0'.
5. **Construct output:** This process repeats for all columns, resulting in the final output grid `O`.


Each version utilizes different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same visual transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity possible within the provided DSL.
