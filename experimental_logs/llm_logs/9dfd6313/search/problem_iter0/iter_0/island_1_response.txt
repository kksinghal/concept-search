## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently shifts digits in each row towards the left, filling the empty spaces on the right with zeros. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

* The '3' in the second row moves to the first position, leaving a '0' in its place.
* The '5's remain in their respective columns.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

* In each row, the non-zero digits shift left, filling the empty spaces with zeros. 
* Notice how the '6's and '4' maintain their relative positions while shifting left.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

* The pattern continues here. Each row sees its non-zero digits consolidated to the left. 
* Again, the relative order of the digits ('8', '2', '1') within each row remains consistent.

## Code Improvement (x5):

Since you haven't provided the two existing programs to improve upon, I'll provide five distinct program versions inspired by the transformation logic and using the DSL from `dsl.py`. 

**Program Version 1: Using `objects` and `move` **

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)  
    new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))  
    for obj in objs:
        leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
        new_obj = shift(obj, (0, -leftmost_j))
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, new_obj) 
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, False, False, True)` to get a set of objects within the input grid `I`. We set `univalued=False` to allow objects with different colors, `diagonal=False` to consider only direct neighbors for object formation, and `without_bg=True` to exclude the background color.
2. **Create Empty Canvas:**  We use `canvas(0, shape(I))` to create a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.
3. **Iterate and Shift:** We iterate through each identified object. For each object:
    *  Calculate Shift:  `leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)` finds the leftmost column index of the object. 
    *  Shift Object:  `new_obj = shift(obj, (0, -leftmost_j))` shifts the object to the left edge of the grid.
    *  Paint Object:  `new_grid = paint(new_grid, new_obj)`  paints the shifted object onto the new grid.
4. **Return New Grid:** Finally, the function returns the transformed `new_grid`.

**Program Version 2:  Row-wise Manipulation with `crop` and `hconcat` **

```python
def solve(I):
    new_rows = []
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        non_zeros = tuple(v for v in row if v != 0) 
        padding = (0,) * (len(row) - len(non_zeros))
        new_row = non_zeros + padding
        new_rows.append(new_row)
    return tuple(new_rows)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** The code iterates through each row in the input grid.
2. **Extract Non-Zeros:** For each row, it creates a new tuple `non_zeros` containing only the non-zero digits from that row.
3. **Create Padding:** It calculates the number of zeros needed to pad the row  (`len(row) - len(non_zeros)`).
4. **Concatenate and Append:** It concatenates the `non_zeros` with the zero padding to form the `new_row` and appends it to the `new_rows` list.
5. **Return as Grid:** Finally, the `new_rows` list is converted back into a grid (tuple of tuples) and returned.

**Program Version 3: Using `index` and List Comprehension**

```python
def solve(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return tuple(tuple(index(I, (i, j - sum(index(I, (i, k)) == 0 for k in range(j)))) if j - sum(index(I, (i, k)) == 0 for k in range(j)) >= 0 else 0 for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions and the `index` function to achieve the transformation in a more concise, but less readable way. 

1. **Iterate through Cells:** The outer comprehension iterates through rows (`i`), and the inner one iterates through columns (`j`).
2. **Calculate Shift:**  For each cell `(i, j)`, the code calculates the shift amount by counting the number of zero-valued cells to its left (`sum(index(I, (i, k)) == 0 for k in range(j))`).
3. **Adjust Index and Get Value:** The shifted column index (`j - shift_amount`) is used with `index(I, (i, shifted_j))` to retrieve the value from the input grid. If the shifted index is negative, 0 is used as the value.

**Program Version 4: Utilizing `apply` and Lambda Functions**

```python
def solve(I):
    return apply(lambda row: tuple(filter(lambda x: x != 0, row)) + (0,) * (len(row) - len(tuple(filter(lambda x: x != 0, row)))), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Apply to Rows:** This program uses the `apply` function to apply a lambda function to each row of the input grid.
2. **Lambda for Shifting:** The lambda function takes a row as input and performs the following:
    * **Filters Non-Zeros:** It filters out the zeros from the row using `filter(lambda x: x != 0, row)`.
    * **Calculates Padding:** It calculates the number of zeros needed for padding.
    * **Concatenates:** It concatenates the filtered non-zeros with the zero padding. 
3. **Return Transformed Grid:** The `apply` function returns a new grid with the transformed rows. 

**Program Version 5: Using Recursion**

```python
def shift_row(row):
    if len(row) == 0:
        return ()
    if row[0] != 0:
        return (row[0],) + shift_row(row[1:])
    else:
        return shift_row(row[1:]) + (0,)

def solve(I):
    return tuple(shift_row(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recursive `shift_row` Function:** This function takes a row as input and recursively shifts non-zero digits to the left. 
   * **Base Case:** If the row is empty, return an empty tuple.
   * **Recursive Steps:** 
      * If the first element is non-zero, keep it and recursively call the function with the rest of the row.
      * If the first element is zero, recursively call the function with the rest of the row and append a zero at the end.
2. **Apply to Each Row:** The main `solve` function applies the `shift_row` function to each row of the input grid `I`.

## Code Extraction:

You can easily copy and paste the code for each "Program_to_be_generated" version from the blocks above. They are formatted to be directly usable in a Python environment where the functions from the `dsl.py` file are available.
