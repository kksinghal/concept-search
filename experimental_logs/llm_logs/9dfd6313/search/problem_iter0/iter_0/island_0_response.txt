## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic for this puzzle involves re-arranging the digits within each row of the input grid, grouping same-value digits together and moving them towards the leftmost positions.  Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '3' in the second row moves to the second position of the first row, while maintaining its relative order with the '5'.
* Zeroes are pushed to the rightmost positions.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* In each row, same-value digits are grouped together towards the left. 
* The order of different digits within the row is maintained.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* Similar to previous examples, same-value digits within each row are grouped towards the left, preserving the relative order of different digits.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_d0f5fe59(I):
  O = ()
  for row in I:
    newRow = ()
    for color in palette(row):
      newRow += repeat(color, colorcount(row, color))
    newRow += repeat(ZERO, len(row) - len(newRow)) 
    O += (newRow,)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Extract and group digits:** For each row, it identifies unique digits (using `palette`) and groups them together (using `repeat` and `colorcount`).
3. **Fill with zeroes:**  Remaining positions in the row are filled with zeroes.
4. **Construct output:** Modified rows are combined to form the output grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_d0f5fe59(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(color for color in palette(row) for j in range(colorcount(row, color))) +
    repeat(ZERO, width(row) - numcolors(row))
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List comprehension:** Utilizes nested list comprehension for compact code.
2. **Extract and repeat:** Extracts unique colors and repeats them based on their count in the row.
3. **Fill remaining space:** Fills the remaining space with zeroes using `repeat`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_d0f5fe59(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(sorted(row, key=lambda x: (x == 0, x)))
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sorting by custom key:** This version leverages the `sorted` function with a custom key.
2. **Prioritizing non-zeroes:** The custom key prioritizes non-zero digits, effectively pushing zeroes to the right.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_d0f5fe59(I):
  O = ()
  for row in I:
    nonZeroes = totuple(palette(row) - {0})
    newRow = ()
    for color in nonZeroes:
      newRow += repeat(color, colorcount(row, color))
    newRow += repeat(0, len(row) - len(newRow))
    O += (newRow,)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Separate non-zeroes:**  This version first extracts and groups all non-zero digits.
2. **Construct and fill:** It then constructs the new row by adding the grouped non-zero digits and filling the remaining space with zeroes.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_d0f5fe59(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(v for k in sorted(set(row)) for v in repeat(k, row.count(k))) 
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort and Repeat:**  Sorts the unique digits in each row and then repeats them according to their count. 
2. **Concise Comprehension:** Employs a concise list comprehension for the transformation. 

These five programs demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the DSL, showcasing different function combinations and logic.
