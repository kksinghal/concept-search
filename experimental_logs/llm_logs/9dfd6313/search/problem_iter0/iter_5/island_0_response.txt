## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to shift the digits in each column upwards, filling the vacated positions at the bottom of the column with zeros.  Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The '3' in the second row, first column moves to the first row, first column. 
* The '5' in the third row, third column stays in place.
* All other positions are filled with '0'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* In the first column, the '6's move up one position, and a '0' fills the bottom position.
* In the fourth column, the '4' and '5' move up one position, and a '0' fills the bottom position. 
* The remaining digits stay in their original positions.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* This example follows the same pattern, with digits shifting upwards within their respective columns and '0's filling the bottom positions.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(grid):
    h = height(grid)
    w = width(grid)
    new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for j in range(w):
        column = tuple(grid[i][j] for i in range(h))
        shifted_column = tuple(v for v in column if v != 0) + tuple(0 for _ in range(h - len(tuple(v for v in column if v != 0))))
        for i in range(h):
            new_grid = fill(new_grid, shifted_column[i], ((i, j),))
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Get the height and width of the input grid and create a new grid filled with zeros using `canvas(0, (h, w))`.
2. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column (`j`) of the input grid.
3. **Extract and Shift:** 
   - Extract the column as a tuple.
   - Create a new tuple (`shifted_column`) containing the non-zero values shifted upwards, followed by zeros to fill the remaining positions.
4. **Fill New Grid:**  Place the values from the `shifted_column` into the corresponding column of the `new_grid` using `fill`. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(grid):
    h = height(grid)
    return tuple(tuple(v for i in range(h) if grid[i][j] == v) + tuple(0 for _ in range(h - len(tuple(v for i in range(h) if grid[i][j] == v)))) for j in range(width(grid)) for v in set(grid[i][j] for i in range(h)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation concisely:

1. **Iterate Columns & Values:** The outer loop iterates through each column (`j`) and unique value (`v`) in that column.
2. **Filter and Fill:** For each value `v` in a column:
   -  It creates a tuple containing all occurrences of `v`, effectively shifting them upwards.
   -  It appends a tuple of zeros to fill the remaining positions in the column. 
3. **Construct Output:** The result of the comprehension is a new grid with the desired transformations.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(grid):
    w = width(grid)
    return tuple(tuple(v for v in (grid[i][j] for i in range(height(grid))) if v != 0) + tuple(0 for _ in range(height(grid) - len(tuple(v for v in (grid[i][j] for i in range(height(grid))) if v != 0)))) for j in range(w))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested generator expressions within list comprehensions:

1. **Iterate Columns:** The outer loop iterates through each column (`j`) of the input grid.
2. **Extract, Filter, and Fill:** For each column:
   - A generator expression extracts the column values.
   - Another generator filters out zeros, effectively shifting non-zero values up.
   - It appends zeros to fill the remaining positions. 
3. **Construct Output:** The list comprehension constructs the output grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(grid):
    h = height(grid)
    w = width(grid)
    return tuple(tuple(next((grid[i][j] for i in range(k, h) if grid[i][j] != 0), 0) for k in range(h)) for j in range(w))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested generator expressions and `next` for a more Pythonic approach:

1. **Iterate Columns:** The outer loop iterates through columns (`j`).
2. **Find Non-Zero:**  For each position (`k`) in a column:
   -  It uses `next` to find the first non-zero value starting from the current position `k` downwards. If none are found, it defaults to 0.
3. **Construct Output:**  The nested comprehensions efficiently build the transformed grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(grid):
    h = height(grid)
    w = width(grid)
    return tuple(tuple(grid[i][j] if grid[i][j] != 0 else next((grid[k][j] for k in range(i + 1, h) if grid[k][j] != 0), 0) for i in range(h)) for j in range(w))
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid and conditionally shifts elements:

1. **Iterate Grid:**  Iterates through rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).
2. **Conditional Shift:** 
   - If the current element is non-zero, keep it as is.
   - If the current element is zero, it searches for the next non-zero element in the same column below and places it in the current position. If no non-zero element is found, it remains as zero.
3. **Construct Output:** The nested comprehensions efficiently build the transformed grid.


These five versions offer diverse approaches to solving the transformation task within the constraints of the provided DSL, demonstrating a range of programming styles and techniques.
