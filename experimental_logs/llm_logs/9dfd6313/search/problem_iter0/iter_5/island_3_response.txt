## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** Each non-background object in the input grid is shifted horizontally to the right by a number of positions equal to its value. The shifting wraps around the grid, meaning if an object would be shifted past the right edge, it reappears on the left.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:** Similar to the first transformation, each non-background object is shifted right by a number of positions equal to its value with wrap-around.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**  This transformation follows the same pattern as the previous two:  non-background objects are shifted right with wrap-around based on their value. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A and Program_B)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas with the background color.
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):  # Iterate over each foreground object.
    c = color(obj)  # Get the color of the current object.
    shift_amount = c % width(I)  # Calculate the wrap-around shift amount.
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))  # Shift the object horizontally.
    O = paint(O, shifted_obj)  # Paint the shifted object onto the canvas.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** An empty canvas of the same size as the input grid is created, filled with the most common color (background) of the input grid.
2. **Object Iteration:** The code iterates through each distinct object (connected components with the same color) in the input grid, excluding the background. 
3. **Shift Calculation:** For each object, the amount of horizontal shift is determined by calculating the remainder (modulo operation) of the object's color divided by the grid's width. This ensures wrap-around shifting.
4. **Object Shifting:** The `shift` function shifts the entire object horizontally by the calculated amount.
5. **Painting:** The shifted object is then painted onto the canvas.
6. **Output:** Finally, the canvas containing the transformed objects is returned as the output.

**Program Version 2:** (Using cell-based approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas
    for x, y in asindices(I):  # Iterate over each cell in the input grid
        c = index(I, (x, y))  # Get color at the current cell
        shift_amount = c % width(I)  # Calculate the shift amount
        new_y = (y + shift_amount) % width(I)  # Calculate the new y coordinate (with wrap-around)
        O = paint(O, {(c, (x, new_y))})  # Paint the cell at the new location
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates an empty canvas with the background color.
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid using its indices (x, y).
3. **Color and Shift:** Retrieves the color at the current cell and calculates the shift amount based on its value.
4. **New Position:** Determines the new y-coordinate after the shift, handling wrap-around using the modulo operation.
5. **Painting:** Paints a single-cell object with the retrieved color at the calculated new location on the canvas. 
6. **Output:** Returns the final canvas with the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:** (Using `recolor` and `ofcolor`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  w = width(I)  # Get the width of the grid
  bg = mostcommon(I)  # Get the background color
  for c in palette(I) - {bg}:  # Iterate over each color except the background
    O = paint(cover(O, recolor(c, ofcolor(I, c))), 
              shift(recolor(c, ofcolor(I, c)), (0, (c - bg) % w)))  # Shift and paint each color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Starts with the input grid.
2. **Color Iteration:** Iterates over each unique color in the input grid, excluding the background color.
3. **Shift and Paint:** For each color:
    - It first covers (removes) the existing objects of that color.
    - Then, it recolors the indices of that color to itself, effectively creating a new object representing all instances of that color.
    - It shifts this new object horizontally by an amount determined by the difference between the color value and the background color, modulo the grid's width. 
    - Finally, it paints this shifted object onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:** (Functional approach with `apply`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  shift_fn = lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, (color(obj) - bg) % width(I)))
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(shift_fn, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background and Shift Function:** It identifies the background color and defines a lambda function `shift_fn` that takes an object and returns the same object shifted horizontally based on its color and the grid's width.
2. **Object Transformation:** It extracts all foreground objects from the input grid and applies the `shift_fn` to each object using the `apply` function. This results in a set of shifted objects.
3. **Canvas Painting:** It creates a new canvas with the background color and paints the merged set of shifted objects onto it.
4. **Output:** The resulting canvas, representing the transformed grid, is returned.


**Program Version 5:** (Using `fork` and composed functions)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcommon(I)
    shift_amount = lambda obj: (color(obj) - bg) % width(I)
    shift_object = lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, shift_amount(obj)))
    return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(shift_object, objects(I, True, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Helper Functions:** Identifies the background color. Defines two helper functions: `shift_amount` calculates the shift amount for an object, and `shift_object` shifts an object horizontally using `shift_amount`.
2. **Object Transformation:**  Extracts all foreground objects. Uses `apply` to apply the `shift_object` function to each object, creating a set of shifted objects.
3. **Canvas Painting:** Creates a new canvas with the background color and paints the merged set of shifted objects onto it.
4. **Output:** Returns the canvas representing the transformed grid.

These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the same grid transformation, using different combinations of DSL functions and programming paradigms.
