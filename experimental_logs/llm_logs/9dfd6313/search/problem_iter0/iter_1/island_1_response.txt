## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-zero elements of each row to the left, effectively removing the spaces between them while preserving their order. The background color (0 in this case) fills the remaining spaces on the right.

**Input 0:**

- **Row 1:** `5 0 0` becomes `5 3 0`
- **Row 2:** `3 5 0` becomes `0 5 0`
- **Row 3:** `0 0 5` remains `0 0 5`

**Input 1:**

- **Row 1:** `5 0 0 0` becomes `5 0 6 6`
- **Row 2:** `0 5 0 0` becomes `0 5 0 0`
- **Row 3:** `6 0 5 0` becomes `0 0 5 4`
- **Row 4:** `6 0 4 5` becomes `0 0 0 5`

**Input 2:**

- **Row 1:** `5 0 0 0 0` becomes `5 0 8 0 0`
- **Row 2:** `0 5 0 0 0` becomes `0 5 8 2 2`
- **Row 3:** `8 8 5 0 0` becomes `0 0 5 0 0`
- **Row 4:** `0 2 0 5 0` becomes `0 0 0 5 1`
- **Row 5:** `0 2 0 1 5` becomes `0 0 0 0 5`


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" function:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(v for v in r if v != 0) + tuple(0 for _ in range(len(r) - len(tuple(v for v in r if v != 0)))) for r in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row of the grid. For each row, it creates two tuples: one containing all non-zero elements and another containing zeros equal to the number of spaces in the original row. It then concatenates these tuples and returns the resulting grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(sorted(row, key=lambda x: x == 0)) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `sorted` function with a custom key to move all zeros to the right. It iterates through each row and sorts it based on whether each element is zero or not.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = []
  for row in grid:
    new_row = []
    count_zeros = row.count(0)
    for element in row:
      if element != 0:
        new_row.append(element)
    for _ in range(count_zeros):
      new_row.append(0)
    new_grid.append(tuple(new_row))
  return tuple(new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row, counts the zeros, and appends the non-zero elements to a new row. Finally, it appends the counted zeros to the new row and constructs the new grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            next(element for element in row if element != 0) if any(element != 0 for element in row) else 0 
            for _ in range(len(row))
        ) if any(element != 0 for element in row) else tuple(0 for _ in range(len(row)))
        for row in grid
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested comprehensions. It checks if any non-zero elements exist in a row. If so, it iterates and appends the first non-zero element for each position. Otherwise, it fills the row with zeros.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    h = height(grid)
    w = width(grid)
    new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for i in range(h):
        j = 0
        for k in range(w):
            if grid[i][k] != 0:
                new_grid = fill(new_grid, grid[i][k], {(i, j)})
                j += 1
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over each cell in the input grid. For each non-zero element encountered, it fills the corresponding position in a new, zero-initialized grid, incrementing the column counter for the new grid to ensure elements are shifted left.

These are just five examples of how you could approach this problem. There are many other potential solutions using the provided DSL functions. The key is to understand the transformation logic and then find creative ways to implement it using the available tools.
