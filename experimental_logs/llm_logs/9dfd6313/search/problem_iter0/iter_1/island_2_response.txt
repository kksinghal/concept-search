## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts each object (group of identical, non-background digits) horizontally to a new column determined by the object's color. The background color remains unchanged.

**Example:**

* **Input_0:** 
    ```
    5 0 0
    3 5 0
    0 0 5 
    ```
* **Output_0:**
    ```
    5 3 0
    0 5 0
    0 0 5
    ```
  * The object '3' (at position (1,0)) moves from column 0 to column 3. 
  * The object '5's move from columns 0 & 1 to column 5.

**Logic:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The input grid is parsed to identify distinct objects based on adjacent identical digits (excluding the background color).
2. **Determine Shift:** For each object, the shift amount is calculated as the difference between its color value and the minimum color value present in the input grid.
3. **Shift Objects:** Each object is shifted horizontally by the determined amount.
4. **Reconstruct Grid:**  The shifted objects are placed back onto the grid, maintaining their original vertical positions. Background cells remain unchanged.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the DSL, along with explanations for each version:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def aihifeifaaeeecjhbfbebfcddcgaeage(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, color(obj) - minimum(palette(I)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input (`I`), filled with the background color (most common color).
2. **Iterate Objects:** `for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)` iterates through each distinct object (non-background) in the input grid.
3. **Calculate Shift:** `color(obj) - minimum(palette(I))` calculates the horizontal shift for the current object.
4. **Shift and Paint:** `paint(O, shift(obj, (0, shift)))` shifts the object horizontally and paints it onto the canvas (`O`).
5. **Return Output:** The function returns the transformed grid (`O`).


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def aihifeifaaeeecjhbfbebfcddcgaeage(I):
  min_color = minimum(palette(I))
  O = apply(lambda row: tuple(index(I,(i, j - (I[i][j] - min_color) if I[i][j] != min_color else 0)) 
                              for j in range(len(I[0]))), 
                              enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Minimum Color:** `min_color = minimum(palette(I))` determines the minimum color value in the input grid.
2. **Apply Transformation:** `apply(lambda... , enumerate(I))` iterates through each cell of the input grid (`I`) along with its row index (`i`).
3. **Calculate New Column:**  For each cell, if it's not the background color, its new column index is calculated as `j - (I[i][j] - min_color)`.
4. **Retrieve Color:** `index(I,(i, new_j))` retrieves the color value from the original position.
5. **Construct Output:** The transformed rows are combined into a tuple to form the output grid (`O`). 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def aihifeifaaeeecjhbfbebfcddcgaeage(I):
  min_color = minimum(palette(I))
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != min_color:
        O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j - (value - min_color)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 2, this version first finds the minimum color (`min_color`) and creates a canvas (`O`) filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** It then iterates through each cell in the input grid. If a cell's value is not the background color, it calculates the new column index (`j - (value - min_color)`) and paints the cell with its original value at the new location on the canvas.
3. **Return Output:**  Finally, it returns the modified canvas `O` as the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def aihifeifaaeeecjhbfbebfcddcgaeage(I):
  min_color = minimum(palette(I))
  shifted_objects = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, color(obj) - min_color)), objects(I, T, F, T))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objects))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Minimum Color & Objects:**  This version starts by identifying the minimum color and extracting all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Shift Objects:**  It then uses `apply` to apply a lambda function to each object, which shifts the object horizontally based on its color and the minimum color.
3. **Paint Shifted Objects:** The shifted objects are then merged and painted onto a canvas initialized with the background color.
4. **Return Output:** Finally, the function returns the canvas with the painted shifted objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def aihifeifaaeeecjhbfbebfcddcgaeage(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      index(I, (i, j - (I[i][j] - minimum(palette(I))) if I[i][j] != minimum(palette(I)) else j))
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    )
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Transformation:** This version uses nested list comprehensions for a more concise and direct transformation.
2. **Iterate and Calculate:**  It iterates over each cell (`i`, `j`) and calculates its new column index (`j - (I[i][j] - minimum(palette(I)))`) if the cell's value is not the background color. 
3. **Retrieve Color:** It then retrieves the color at the calculated position from the input grid using `index`.
4. **Construct Output:** Finally, it assembles the transformed cells back into a tuple representing the output grid. 


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. They highlight the ability to solve the problem using various strategies like object-based manipulation, cell-by-cell iteration, and functional programming paradigms.
