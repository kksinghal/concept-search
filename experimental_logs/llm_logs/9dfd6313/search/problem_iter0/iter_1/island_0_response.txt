## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be sorting the digits within each row based on their values, with 0s always pushed to the end.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- Row 1: `5 0 0` becomes `5 3 0` (5 and 3 are sorted, 0 at the end).
- Row 2: `3 5 0` becomes `0 5 0` (5 and 0 are sorted, 0 at the end).
- Row 3: `0 0 5` remains `0 0 5`.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Row 1: `5 0 0 0` becomes `5 0 6 6` (5 and 6s are sorted, 0s at the end).
- Row 2: `0 5 0 0` becomes `0 5 0 0` (5 and 0s are sorted, 0s at the end).
- Row 3: `6 0 5 0` becomes `0 0 5 4` (5, 4 and 0s are sorted, 0s at the end).
- Row 4: `6 0 4 5` becomes `0 0 0 5` (5 and 0s are sorted, 0s at the end).

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Similar sorting logic applies for each row of Input_2 transforming it to Output_2.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" function in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(v for k in sorted(set(row) - {0}) for v in repeat(k, row.count(k))) + repeat(0, len(row) - len(set(row) - {0}))
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through rows:** `for row in I` iterates over each row of the input grid.
2. **Sort non-zero digits:** `sorted(set(row) - {0})` creates a sorted set of unique non-zero digits in the row.
3. **Repeat digits:** `repeat(k, row.count(k))` repeats each digit k according to its count in the row.
4. **Append zeros:** `repeat(0, len(row) - len(set(row) - {0}))` appends the required number of zeros at the end.
5. **Construct output row:** The sorted digits and zeros are combined into a tuple for each row.
6. **Construct output grid:** The output rows are combined into a tuple to form the final grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = ()
  for row in I:
    newRow = tuple(v for k in sorted(palette(row) - {0}) for v in repeat(k, colorcount(row, k)))
    newRow += repeat(0, width(row) - len(newRow))
    O += (newRow,)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through rows:** `for row in I` iterates over each row.
2. **Get non-zero colors:** `palette(row) - {0}` gets unique colors in the row excluding 0.
3. **Sort and repeat colors:** The code iterates through sorted colors and repeats each color using `repeat` and `colorcount`.
4. **Append zeros:** `repeat(0, width(row) - len(newRow))` appends zeros to match row length.
5. **Construct output grid:** Constructed rows are added to the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(color for color in sfilter(palette(row), lambda x: x != 0) for j in range(colorcount(row, color)))
    + repeat(0, width(row) - sum(1 for v in row if v != 0))
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through rows:** `for row in I` processes each row of the input grid.
2. **Filter non-zero colors:** `sfilter(palette(row), lambda x: x != 0)` filters the colors to keep only non-zero values.
3. **Repeat colors:** For each filtered color, it is repeated using `colorcount(row, color)`.
4. **Calculate remaining zeros:**  `width(row) - sum(1 for v in row if v != 0)` calculates the number of zeros needed.
5. **Append zeros:** The calculated number of zeros are appended to the end of the row.
6. **Construct output grid:** The output rows are combined into a tuple.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = ()
  for row in I:
    nonzero_colors = sorted(palette(row) - {0})
    newRow = ()
    for color in nonzero_colors:
      newRow += repeat(color, colorcount(row, color))
    newRow += repeat(0, len(row) - len(newRow))
    O += (newRow,)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through rows:** `for row in I` iterates over each row of the input grid.
2. **Extract non-zero colors:**  `nonzero_colors = sorted(palette(row) - {0})` extracts and sorts unique non-zero colors.
3. **Construct the output row:** Iterates through `nonzero_colors`, repeats each color by its count in the row, and appends zeros to fill the remaining space.
4. **Combine output rows:** Constructed rows are appended to `O` to form the final output grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(c for c in sorted(row) if c != 0) + repeat(0, row.count(0)) for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through rows:** `for row in I` iterates over each row of the input grid.
2. **Sort and filter non-zeros:** `sorted(row) if c != 0` sorts the row and filters out zeros during iteration.
3. **Append zeros:** `repeat(0, row.count(0))` appends the appropriate number of zeros to the end of each row.
4. **Construct output grid:** The transformed rows are combined into a tuple to form the output grid.

These programs achieve the desired outcome by leveraging different DSL function combinations to effectively sort and rearrange the digits within each row. Each version offers a unique approach while maintaining the core logic of the transformation.
