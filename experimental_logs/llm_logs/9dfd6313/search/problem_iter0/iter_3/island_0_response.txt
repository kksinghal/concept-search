## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation rearranges elements within each row of the input grid based on their values.  The transformation logic can be described as follows:

1. **Non-Zero Element Grouping:** All non-zero elements in each row are grouped together at the beginning of the row, maintaining their relative order.
2. **Zero Element Grouping:** All zero elements in each row are grouped together at the end of the row.

**Example:**

Let's take `Input_0` as an example:

```
Input_0:
5 0 0
3 5 0
0 0 5
```

Applying the transformation:

1. **Row 1:** The non-zero elements '5' are grouped first, followed by the zero element '0'. Result: `5 0 0` (no change as it's already in the desired format).
2. **Row 2:** The non-zero elements '3' and '5' are grouped first, followed by the zero element '0'. Result: `3 5 0`.
3. **Row 3:** The non-zero element '5' is grouped first, followed by the zero elements '0 0'. Result: `5 0 0`.

This results in the following output:

```
Output_0:
5 3 0
0 5 0
0 0 5
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(v for k in sorted(palette(row)) for v in repeat(k, colorcount(row, k)))
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each row (`row`) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Sort colors:**  For each row, it gets the unique colors using `palette(row)` and sorts them using `sorted()`.
3. **Repeat colors:**  For each sorted color (`k`), it repeats the color `colorcount(row, k)` times using `repeat(k, colorcount(row, k))`. 
4. **Concatenate:**  It concatenates the repeated colors for all colors in the row.
5. **Form output grid:** The process is repeated for all rows, and the results are combined into a tuple to form the output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(x for x in row if x != 0) + tuple(x for x in row if x == 0)
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each row (`row`) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Separate non-zeros and zeros:** For each row, it creates two separate tuples: one containing all the non-zero elements and another containing all the zero elements.
3. **Concatenate tuples:**  It concatenates the two tuples, placing the non-zero elements first and then the zero elements.
4. **Form output grid:** The process is repeated for all rows, and the results are combined into a tuple to form the output grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(sorted(row, key=lambda x: x == 0))
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each row (`row`) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Custom Sorting:** For each row, it uses `sorted(row, key=lambda x: x == 0)` to sort the elements. The lambda function `lambda x: x == 0` returns `True` for 0 and `False` for non-zero values. Since `False` is interpreted as smaller than `True` during sorting, this effectively groups all the non-zero elements at the beginning. 
3. **Form output grid:** The process is repeated for all rows, and the results are combined into a tuple to form the output grid.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = ()
  for row in I:
    non_zeros = tuple(v for v in row if v != 0)
    zeros = tuple(v for v in row if v == 0)
    O += (non_zeros + zeros,)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** An empty tuple `O` is initialized to store the output grid.
2. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each row (`row`) in the input grid (`I`).
3. **Separate non-zeros and zeros:** For each row, it creates two separate tuples: `non_zeros` containing all the non-zero elements and `zeros` containing all the zero elements.
4. **Concatenate and Append:**  It concatenates the `non_zeros` and `zeros` tuples and appends the resulting tuple to the `O` tuple.
5. **Return Output:** Finally, the `O` tuple, now containing the transformed rows, is returned as the output grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(v for v in row if v) + tuple(v for v in row if not v)
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each row (`row`) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Separate non-zeros and zeros:** For each row, it creates two separate tuples using list comprehensions: one containing all the truthy elements (non-zero values) and another containing all the falsy elements (zero values).
3. **Concatenate tuples:**  It concatenates the two tuples, placing the non-zero elements first and then the zero elements.
4. **Form output grid:** The process is repeated for all rows, and the results are combined into a tuple to form the output grid.
