## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking the input grids to the output grids appears to be **transposing the diagonals of the input grid**. 

Here's how it works for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** 
    - The diagonal (5, 5, 5) becomes the first column (5, 0, 0).
    - The diagonal (3, 0) becomes the second column (3, 5, 0).
    - The last diagonal (0) stays the same as the third column (0, 0, 5).
* **Input_1:** 
    - Similar to Input_0, each diagonal in the input grid transforms into a column in the output grid. 
* **Input_2:**
    - The transformation follows the same pattern of transposing diagonals to columns.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = tuple(
    tuple(
      index(I, (i - j, k)) if 0 <= i - j < len(I) else 0 
      for j in range(i + 1)
    )
    for k in range(len(I[0]))
  for i in range(len(I) + len(I[0]) - 1)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over diagonals:** The outermost loop iterates through each diagonal of the input grid, represented by `i`. The total number of diagonals is `len(I) + len(I[0]) - 1`.
2. **Iterate within each diagonal:** The nested loops iterate through each cell of the current diagonal. The `if` condition ensures that out-of-bound indices are handled by replacing them with 0.
3. **Construct output grid:** The values extracted from the diagonals are used to construct the columns of the output grid `O`. 

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = canvas(0, (h + w - 1, w))
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            O = fill(O, I[i][j], ((i+j, j),))
    return rot90(O)[:w]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create an empty canvas:** The program starts by creating an empty canvas `O` of appropriate dimensions to hold the transformed grid.
2. **Fill the canvas:** It iterates through each cell of the input grid `I` and places the value at the corresponding diagonal position in the canvas `O`.
3. **Rotate and slice:** Finally, it rotates the canvas 90 degrees clockwise and slices the resulting grid to match the output dimensions.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = tuple(
    tuple(
      I[i-k][k] if 0 <= i-k < len(I) and 0 <= k < len(I[0]) else 0
      for k in range(i + 1)
    )
    for i in range(len(I) + len(I[0] ) -1)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through diagonals:** Similar to Version 1, the code iterates over each diagonal of the input grid.
2. **Directly access input grid:** Instead of using `index`, this version directly accesses the input grid `I` using the calculated indices `i-k` and `k` for each diagonal element.
3. **Construct output grid:** It then constructs the output grid `O` by arranging the extracted values into columns.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    return tuple(zip(*[
        [0] * i + list(row) + [0] * (len(I) - i - 1) 
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    ]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Padding and Transposing**: This version adds padding to each row based on its index to align the diagonals vertically. It then transposes the resulting matrix using `zip(*)`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = tuple()
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
      diag = tuple(I[i][j-i] for i in range(j+1) if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j-i < len(I[0]))
      O = O + (diag + (0,) * (len(I) + len(I[0]) - 1 - len(diag)),)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** This version iterates over each column `j` of the input grid.
2. **Extract diagonal:** For each column, it extracts the corresponding diagonal elements into a tuple.
3. **Pad and append to output:** The extracted diagonal is padded with zeros to match the output column length and appended to the output grid `O`. 


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version manipulates the input grid in a unique way to extract and arrange the diagonal elements, highlighting the diverse solutions possible within the DSL's constraints.
