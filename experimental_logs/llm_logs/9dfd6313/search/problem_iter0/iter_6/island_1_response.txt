## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extracting diagonals of the input grid and arranging them as columns in the output grid. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

```
5 0 0     5 3 0
3 5 0 --> 0 5 0
0 0 5     0 0 5 
```

The output grid's columns are formed by the diagonals of the input grid: (5, 3, 0), (0, 5, 0), and (0, 0, 5).

**Input_1:**

```
5 0 0 0     5 0 6 6
0 5 0 0  --> 0 5 0 0
6 0 5 0     0 0 5 4
6 0 4 5     0 0 0 5 
```

Similarly, the output grid's columns represent the diagonals of the input grid.

**Input_2:**

```
5 0 0 0 0     5 0 8 0 0
0 5 0 0 0  --> 0 5 8 2 2
8 8 5 0 0     0 0 5 0 0
0 2 0 5 0     0 0 0 5 1
0 2 0 1 5     0 0 0 0 5
```

The pattern continues, with each diagonal forming a column in the output.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_3af2c5a8(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  output = canvas(0, (max(h, w), min(h, w)))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      output = paint(output, {(grid[i][j], (j, i + j))})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Calculate the input grid's height and width. Create an output grid filled with zeros, having dimensions suitable for accommodating the diagonals.
2. **Diagonal Extraction:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Placement:** For each cell, paint its value onto the output grid at a position corresponding to its diagonal. This is achieved by swapping the row and column indices and adjusting the row index based on the diagonal's position.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_3af2c5a8(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  output = canvas(0, (max(h, w), min(h, w)))
  for i in range(h):
    diag = tuple(grid[i + k][k] if 0 <= i + k < h and 0 <= k < w else 0 for k in range(min(h - i, w)))
    output = paint(output, {(v, (j, i + j)) for j, v in enumerate(diag)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to version 1, calculate dimensions and create an empty output grid.
2. **Diagonal Extraction:** For each row, extract the diagonal starting from that row using list comprehension. Handle out-of-bounds indices by defaulting to 0.
3. **Placement:** Paint the extracted diagonal onto the output grid, ensuring correct positioning.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_3af2c5a8(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  output = tuple()
  for i in range(w):
    diag = tuple(grid[k][i + k] if 0 <= k < h and 0 <= i + k < w else 0 for k in range(min(h, w - i)))
    output += (diag,)
  return dmirror(output)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Obtain input grid dimensions.
2. **Diagonal Extraction:** Extract diagonals starting from each column, handling out-of-bounds indices.
3. **Construction:** Append each extracted diagonal as a row to the output grid.
4. **Final Adjustment:** Diagonals are extracted and placed in a mirrored orientation. Correct this by applying `dmirror` to the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_3af2c5a8(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  indices = asindices(grid)
  output = canvas(0, (max(h, w), min(h, w)))
  for i, j in indices:
    if i + j < max(h, w) and j < min(h, w):
      output = paint(output, {(grid[i][j], (j, i + j))})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Obtain input grid dimensions and create an empty output grid.
2. **Index Iteration:** Iterate through all cell indices of the input grid.
3. **Conditional Placement:** For each index, check if its corresponding diagonal falls within the output grid boundaries. If so, paint the cell's value at the appropriate location in the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_3af2c5a8(grid):
  return dmirror(tuple(
      tuple(grid[i - j][j] if 0 <= i - j < len(grid) else 0 for j in range(i + 1))
      for i in range(len(grid[0]) + len(grid) - 1)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Diagonal Generation:** Generate each diagonal directly using list comprehension, handling out-of-bounds indices. 
2. **Output Construction:** Construct the output grid by arranging the generated diagonals as rows.
3. **Mirroring:** As in version 3, apply `dmirror` to correct the mirrored orientation of the extracted diagonals.
