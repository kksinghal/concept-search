## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be moving all non-zero elements in each row to the left, filling the remaining spaces with zeros. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The '3' in the second row is moved to the beginning of the row.
* The '5' in the third row is moved to the beginning of the row.

**Input_1:**

* The '6's in the third and fourth rows are moved to the beginning of their respective rows.
* The '4' in the fourth row is shifted one position to the left.

**Input_2:**

* The '8's in the third row are moved to the beginning of the row.
* The '2's in the fourth and fifth rows are moved to the beginning of their respective rows.
* The '1' and '5' in the fifth row are shifted two positions to the left. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` function using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(v for v in row if v != 0) + tuple(0 for _ in range(len(row) - len([v for v in row if v != 0]))) 
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The code iterates through each row (`row`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Extract non-zero elements:** For each row, it creates a new tuple containing only the non-zero elements.
3. **Calculate zero padding:** It calculates the number of zeros needed to pad the end of the new row.
4. **Concatenate and return:** The non-zero elements and zero padding are concatenated and returned as a new row in the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(filter(lambda x: x != 0, row)) + tuple(0 for _ in range(len(row) - len(tuple(filter(lambda x: x != 0, row)))))
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Filter:** Similar to Version 1, it iterates through each row but uses `filter(lambda x: x != 0, row)` to keep only non-zero elements.
2. **Calculate Padding:** It calculates the padding length using the difference in lengths of the original row and the filtered row.
3. **Concatenate and Return:**  Similar to Version 1, it combines the filtered elements and padding to form the new row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(sorted(row, key=lambda x: x == 0))
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Sort:** It iterates through rows and uses `sorted` with a custom key `lambda x: x == 0`. 
2. **Sorting Logic:** This key prioritizes non-zero elements (returning `False`) over zero elements (returning `True`) during sorting.
3. **Return Sorted Rows:**  The sorted rows, with non-zero elements at the beginning, are returned as the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(e for e in row if e) + tuple(e for e in row if not e)
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Split:** This version iterates through rows and uses list comprehensions to create two separate tuples: one with non-zero elements and one with zero elements.
2. **Concatenate and Return:** The two tuples are concatenated, placing non-zero elements at the beginning. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(x for x in row if x != mostcommon(tuple(0 for _ in range(len(row))))) + tuple(mostcommon(tuple(0 for _ in range(len(row)))) for _ in range(len(row) - len([x for x in row if x != mostcommon(tuple(0 for _ in range(len(row))))])))
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Zero as Most Common:** It first identifies that '0' will always be the most common element in the padding.
2. **Extract Non-Zero:** It extracts non-zero elements by comparing them to the most common element (which is '0').
3. **Generate Padding:** It generates padding using the most common element and calculates the padding length. 
4. **Concatenate and Return:**  Similar to other versions, it combines non-zero elements and padding.
