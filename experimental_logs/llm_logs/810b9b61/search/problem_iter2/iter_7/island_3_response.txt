## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of a background of 3s and two objects: one formed of 1s and another of 3s.
2.  **Transform Objects:**
    *   The object formed of 1s is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   The object formed of 3s is horizontally mirrored.
3.  **Position Objects:**
    *   The rotated 1s object is shifted downwards and to the right.
    *   The mirrored 3s object is shifted downwards.
4.  **Combine Objects:** The transformed objects are placed onto a blank canvas of 0s.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

This transformation is similar to the previous one, but the objects undergo smaller shifts.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the previous two, but with a smaller grid size and even smaller shifts.

## Code Generation:

**Program\_to\_be\_generated:**

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
    h = height(I)
    obj_3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
    obj_1 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
    obj_3_new = shift(hmirror(obj_3), (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0))
    obj_1_new = shift(rot90(obj_1), (8, 11) if h == 15 else (2, 3))
    return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj_3_new), obj_1_new)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** We extract the object of 3s (`obj_3`) and the object of 1s (`obj_1`) from the input grid (`I`).
2.  **Transform Objects:** We mirror `obj_3` horizontally and shift it downwards. We rotate `obj_1` 90 degrees clockwise and shift it downwards and to the right. The amount of shifting depends on the height of the grid.
3.  **Combine Objects:** We create a blank canvas of 0s and paint the transformed objects onto it.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = len(I)
  indices_3 = ofcolor(I, 3)
  indices_1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
  indices_3_new = shift(hmirror(indices_3), (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0))
  indices_1_new = shift(rot90(toindices(indices_1)), (8, 11) if h == 15 else (2, 3))
  return fill(fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, indices_3_new), 1, indices_1_new)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Indices:** This version utilizes indices instead of objects. We get the indices of all cells containing 3 (`indices_3`) and 1 (`indices_1`).
2.  **Transform Indices:** We perform the same transformations on the indices as in Version 1.
3.  **Fill Canvas:** We create a blank canvas and fill the transformed indices with their respective values (3 and 1).

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
    h = len(I)
    return paint(
        paint(
            canvas(0, shape(I)),
            recolor(3, shift(hmirror(toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 3))), (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0)))
        ),
        recolor(1, shift(rot90(toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 1))), (8, 11) if h == 15 else (2, 3)))
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract, Transform and Recolor:** This version combines extraction, transformation, and recoloring into nested function calls. We extract the objects, transform their indices, and recolor them directly within the `paint` function calls.
2.  **Paint Canvas:** We create a blank canvas and paint the recolored objects onto it.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = len(I)
  return cellwise(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      paint(
          shift(hmirror(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 3)), (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0)),
          shift(rot90(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 1)), (8, 11) if h == 15 else (2, 3))
      ),
      0
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Transform Objects:** We directly transform the extracted objects (mirroring and shifting the 3s object, rotating and shifting the 1s object).
2.  **Cellwise Comparison:** This version uses `cellwise` function. It compares a blank canvas with a canvas painted with transformed objects. If the cells match, the cell value is retained; otherwise, it defaults to 0.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
    h = height(I)
    obj_3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
    obj_1 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
    canvas_ = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for v, (i, j) in obj_3:
        canvas_ = fill(canvas_, v, {(i + (10 if h == 15 else 4),  len(I[0]) - j - 1)})
    for v, (i, j) in obj_1:
        new_i, new_j = j, len(I) - i - 1 if h == 15 else j, len(I) - i
        new_i, new_j = new_i + (8 if h == 15 else 2), new_j + (11 if h == 15 else 3)
        canvas_ = fill(canvas_, v, {(new_i, new_j)})
    return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate and Fill:** This version iterates through each cell of the extracted objects and directly modifies a blank canvas using conditional logic for transformation and placement. 


Each of these versions provides a different approach to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and offering diverse solutions.
