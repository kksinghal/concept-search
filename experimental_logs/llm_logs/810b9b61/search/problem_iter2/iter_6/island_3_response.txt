## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

1. **Object Isolation:** The transformation focuses on the digits '3' and '1', treating the rest as background. 
2. **Digit '3' Transformation:**
    * The '3' object is horizontally mirrored.
    * It's then shifted down by 10 units.
3. **Digit '1' Transformation:**
    * The '1' object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    * It's then shifted right by 8 units and down by 11 units.
4. **Final Composition:** The transformed '3' and '1' objects are painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as Input 0 - Output 0, with the exception that the '3' object is shifted down by only 4 units instead of 10.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**

This transformation also follows the same logic as the previous two, but with these adjustments:

* The '3' object is shifted down by 4 units.
* The '1' object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
* The '1' object is shifted right by 2 units and down by 3 units.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  obj_3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  obj_3_new = shift(hmirror(obj_3), (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0))
  obj_1_new = shift(rot90(obj_1), (8, 11) if h == 15 else (2, 3))
  return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj_3_new), obj_1_new)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Object Extraction:**  Extract objects with color '3' and '1' from the input grid `I`.
2.  **Transformations:**
    *   Horizontally mirror the '3' object (`hmirror`).
    *   Shift the mirrored '3' object down based on the input height (`shift`).
    *   Rotate the '1' object 90 degrees clockwise (`rot90`).
    *   Shift the rotated '1' object right and down based on input height (`shift`).
3.  **Painting:**
    *   Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid (`canvas`).
    *   Paint the transformed '3' object onto the canvas.
    *   Paint the transformed '1' object onto the canvas.
    *   Return the final painted canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    canvas_ = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if I[i][j] == 3:
                canvas_ = fill(canvas_, 3, {(h - 1 - i + (10 if h == 15 else 4), j)})
            elif I[i][j] == 1:
                new_i, new_j = (j, 14 - i) if h == 15 else (j, 8 - i)
                new_i, new_j = (new_i + 8, new_j + 11) if h == 15 else (new_i + 2, new_j + 3)
                canvas_ = fill(canvas_, 1, {(new_i, new_j)})
    return canvas_ 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
2. **Iterative Transformation:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
   - If the cell value is '3':
     - Calculate the new cell position after mirroring and shifting based on grid height.
     - Fill the corresponding cell on the canvas with '3'.
   - If the cell value is '1':
     - Calculate the new cell position after rotating and shifting based on grid height.
     - Fill the corresponding cell on the canvas with '1'.
3. **Return Canvas:** Return the transformed canvas.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    indices_3 = ofcolor(I, 3)
    indices_1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
    indices_3_new = shift(hmirror(indices_3), (10 if len(I) == 15 else 4, 0))
    indices_1_new = shift(rot90(toindices(indices_1)), (8, 11) if len(I) == 15 else (2, 3))
    return fill(fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, indices_3_new), 1, indices_1_new)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Index Extraction:** Extract indices of cells with values '3' and '1' from the input grid.
2. **Index Transformation:**
   - Mirror the '3' indices horizontally and shift them down.
   - Convert the '1' indices to a grid representation, rotate it 90 degrees, and shift it right and down.
3. **Canvas Filling:**
   - Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
   - Fill the canvas with '3' at the transformed '3' indices.
   - Fill the canvas with '1' at the transformed '1' indices.
   - Return the filled canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h = len(I)
    return paint(
        paint(
            canvas(0, shape(I)),
            recolor(3, shift(hmirror(toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 3))), (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0)))
        ),
        recolor(1, shift(rot90(toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 1))), (8, 11) if h == 15 else (2, 3)))
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction and Transformation:** Similar to previous versions, extract the '3' and '1' objects, perform the respective transformations on their indices, and recolor them.
2. **Painting:** Directly paint the transformed and recolored objects onto a blank canvas. This approach combines object manipulation and canvas painting in a nested manner for conciseness.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = len(I)
  return cellwise(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      paint(
          shift(hmirror(replace(I, 3, 1)), (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0)),
          shift(rot90(replace(I, 1, 3)), (8, 11) if h == 15 else (2, 3))
      ),
      0
  )

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Color Swapping:** Temporarily swap the colors of '1' and '3' in the input grid.
2. **Transformations:** Perform the mirroring and shifting transformations as before on the swapped grid.
3. **Cellwise Merging:**  Use `cellwise` to merge the transformed grid with a blank canvas, retaining the transformations only for the swapped colors. 
4. **Implicit Reversion:** By using '0' as the fallback value in `cellwise`, the original colors are effectively restored in the final output. 

Each of these five versions offers a distinct approach to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
