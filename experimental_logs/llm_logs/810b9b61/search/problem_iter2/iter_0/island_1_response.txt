## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** This transformation extracts each 3-valued object from the input grid, rotates it 90 degrees counterclockwise, then places it in a new location on a blank canvas. The new location seems to be determined by a pattern related to the object's original position and shape.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This transformation is similar to the first one, but it only extracts and repositions a single 3-valued object from the input grid. The new location and rotation of the object again seem to follow a specific pattern.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** This transformation again involves extracting the 3-valued object, rotating it counterclockwise, and repositioning it on a blank canvas. However, the new location and rotation seem to follow a different pattern compared to the previous examples.

## Code Generation:

It seems the provided programs and similarity scores are missing, making it impossible to analyze and improve upon them. 

However, based on the transformation analysis, I can provide a possible approach and some code snippets in the given DSL:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Extract 3-valued objects
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    
    # 2. Define a function to reposition objects
    def reposition(obj):
        # Logic to determine new position and rotation based on object properties
        # (This logic needs to be determined based on the exact pattern in the examples)
        
        # Example: Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise and shift
        new_obj = rot270(obj)
        new_obj = shift(new_obj, (offset_i, offset_j)) # Calculate offset based on pattern
        return new_obj
    
    # 3. Apply repositioning and paint on canvas
    new_objs = apply(reposition, objs)
    canvas_size = (height(I), width(I)) # Assuming canvas size is same as input
    O = canvas(0, canvas_size)
    O = paint(O, new_objs)
    
    return O
```

### Explanation:

1. **Extract 3-valued objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I` that are connected, not diagonally connected, and not the background color.
2. **Define `reposition` function:** This function takes an object as input and applies the necessary rotation and shift based on the specific pattern observed in the examples.
    - **Rotation:** `rot270(obj)` rotates the object 90 degrees counterclockwise. 
    - **Shifting:**  `shift(new_obj, (offset_i, offset_j))` shifts the object. The `offset_i` and `offset_j` values should be calculated based on the pattern of movement in the examples. 
3. **Apply, Create Canvas, and Paint:** 
    - `apply(reposition, objs)` applies the `reposition` function to each extracted object.
    - `canvas(0, canvas_size)` creates a blank canvas filled with zeros, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
    - `paint(O, new_objs)` paints the transformed objects onto the canvas.

### Missing Information:

Without the missing programs, similarity scores, and further details on the repositioning pattern, it's challenging to provide the exact code and ensure diversity among the five versions. 

**To achieve the perfect score (0), I need:**

1. **The two unprovided programs and their similarity scores.**
2. **Clearer examples or explanations of the pattern governing object repositioning and rotation in each input-output pair.**

Please provide this missing information so I can generate the accurate code for "Program_to_be_generated" and achieve the desired score.
