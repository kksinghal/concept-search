## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and repositioning them within a blank canvas.  The repositioning seems to follow these rules:

**General Pattern:**

* **Placement Order:** Objects are placed in a specific order, potentially related to their size or position in the original grid.
* **Horizontal Shift:** Objects are shifted horizontally, seemingly based on their original column position.
* **Vertical Shift:**  Objects are shifted vertically, possibly determined by their original row position.
* **Background Fill:** The output grid is initially blank (filled with zeros) and the background color of the input grid seems to be ignored.

**Specific Observations:**

* **Input 0:** The single object is split into three parts and rearranged in a specific pattern.
* **Input 1:**  The single object is again divided and repositioned, with larger vertical spacing. 
* **Input 2:** The single object is split into two parts and placed with a larger vertical gap.


## Code Generation:

Due to the complexity of the transformation and the unavailability of the two existing programs for reference, providing five distinct and accurate code solutions is not feasible. However, I can outline a general approach and provide a single program version as a starting point.


### Program Version 1: 

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects from the input grid
  new_objs = set()
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    # Calculate horizontal and vertical shift based on object's position
    h_shift =  (i + 1) * width(obj) # Example: adjust multiplier as needed
    v_shift = (i + 1) * height(obj) # Example: adjust multiplier as needed
    new_objs.add(shift(obj, (v_shift, h_shift)))
  
  canvas_size = (height(I) * 2, width(I) * 2)  # Example: adjust canvas size as needed
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size) 
  for obj in new_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj) 
  return O
```


### Explanation:

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies and separates objects in the input grid `I`. 
2. **Iterate and Calculate Shifts:**  The code iterates through each extracted object (`obj`) and determines its new position based on:
    * `i`:  The object's index (order of appearance).
    * `width(obj)` and `height(obj)`: The object's dimensions. 
3. **Shift and Store:** Each object is shifted using `shift(obj, (v_shift, h_shift))` and added to `new_objs`. 
4. **Create Canvas and Paint:** A blank canvas (`O`) is created using `canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)`. The shifted objects are then painted onto the canvas using `paint(O, obj)`.


### Limitations & Further Development:

This program serves as a basic framework.  To achieve perfect scores, you'll need to refine the shift calculations (`h_shift` and `v_shift`) based on the exact relationships observed in the input-output pairs. Additionally:

* **Object Splitting:**  The current program does not address the splitting of objects observed in the examples.  You'll need to incorporate logic to divide objects based on specific criteria and adjust their positions accordingly.
* **Order of Operations:** The order in which objects are placed significantly affects the output. Experiment with different sorting methods (e.g., by size, color, original position) to achieve the desired arrangements.

**Remember:**  

* Carefully analyze the input-output pairs to identify all the rules and patterns. 
* Experiment with different DSL functions and combinations to achieve the desired results.
* Iteratively refine your code based on the output until you achieve perfect similarity scores.
