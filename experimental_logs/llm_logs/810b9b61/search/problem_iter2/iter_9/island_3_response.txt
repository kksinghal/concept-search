## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of color '3' and '1' on the input grid and applying specific transformations to them on the output grid. The background color is always '0'.

**Object 3:** This object is horizontally mirrored and then shifted downwards. The amount of shift depends on the height of the input grid: 10 units for height 15, and 4 units for other heights.

**Object 1:** This object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Then, it is shifted right and downwards. The amount of shift depends on the height of the input grid: (8, 11) for height 15, and (2, 3) for other heights.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the given DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  obj_3 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 3))
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 1))
  return paint(
    paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)), 
      shift(hmirror(obj_3), (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0))
    ),
    shift(rot90(obj_1), (8, 11) if h == 15 else (2, 3))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** We first identify objects of color 3 and 1 using `objects` and `extract` functions with a `matcher` to filter by color.
2. **Transform objects:** 
    - `obj_3` is mirrored horizontally using `hmirror` and shifted downwards using `shift`.
    - `obj_1` is rotated clockwise using `rot90` and shifted using `shift`.
3. **Paint objects:** Finally, a blank canvas is created using `canvas`, and the transformed objects are painted onto it using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  return paint(
    paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      recolor(
        3,
        shift(
          hmirror(toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 3)))),
          (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0),
        ),
      ),
    ),
    recolor(
      1,
      shift(
        rot90(toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 1)))),
        (8, 11) if h == 15 else (2, 3),
      ),
    ),
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and convert to indices:** We extract the objects and directly convert them to indices using `toindices`.
2. **Transform indices:**
    - Mirroring and shifting is applied to the indices of object 3.
    - Rotation and shifting are applied to the indices of object 1.
3. **Recolor canvas:** A blank canvas is created, and `recolor` is used to color the specified indices with corresponding colors.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  return cellwise(
    canvas(0, shape(I)),
    paint(
      fill(
        canvas(0, shape(I)),
        3,
        shift(
          hmirror(toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 3)))),
          (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0),
        ),
      ),
      1,
      shift(
        rot90(toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 1)))),
        (8, 11) if h == 15 else (2, 3),
      ),
    ),
    0,
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract, convert and transform:** Similar to Version 2, we extract objects, convert to indices, and apply transformations.
2. **Fill canvases:** Two canvases are created. One is filled with color 3 at the transformed indices of object 3, and the other is filled with color 1 at the transformed indices of object 1.
3. **Cellwise merge:** The two canvases are merged using `cellwise` with '0' as the fallback value, effectively painting the objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  obj_3 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 3))
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 1))
  obj_3_new = shift(hmirror(obj_3), (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0))
  obj_1_new = shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj_1), I)), (8, 11) if h == 15 else (2, 3))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for v, (i, j) in obj_3_new:
    O = fill(O, v, {(i, j)})
  for v, (i, j) in obj_1_new:
    O = fill(O, v, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and transform:** Extract objects, apply transformations to get `obj_3_new` and `obj_1_new`.
2. **Iterate and fill:** Create a blank canvas. Iterate through each cell of the transformed objects and fill the canvas with the corresponding color at the specified indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = len(I)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 3:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(h - i + 9 if h == 15 else h - i + 3, j)})
      elif I[i][j] == 1:
        new_i, new_j = j, h - i - 1 if h == 15 else j, h - i
        O = fill(O, 1, {(new_i + (8 if h == 15 else 2), new_j + (11 if h == 15 else 3))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and conditionally fill:** Create a blank canvas. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Conditional Transformation:** Based on the cell value (3 or 1), calculate the transformed indices and fill the canvas with the corresponding color.

Each of these five programs utilizes distinct logic and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the same desired output, showcasing diverse approaches to solve the given transformation problem.
