## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves separating the two objects (color 1 and 3) present in the input grid, applying specific transformations to each, and then painting them back onto a blank canvas of the same size. 

- **Object 3:** Horizontally mirrored and shifted down by 10 units.
- **Object 1:** Rotated 90 degrees clockwise and shifted right by 8 units and down by 11 units.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  This transformation also involves separating the two objects. However, only Object 1 is transformed and repainted.

- **Object 3:**  Remains unchanged.
- **Object 1:** Rotated 90 degrees clockwise and shifted down by 8 units and right by 11 units.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** This transformation follows the same pattern as before.

- **Object 3:** Horizontally mirrored and shifted down by 4 units.
- **Object 1:** Rotated 90 degrees clockwise and shifted down by 2 units and right by 3 units.

**Key Observation:** The transformations for Object 1 and 3 depend on the height of the input grid. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL from `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1 (Object-Based with Conditional Shift):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_3 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  obj_3_new = shift(hmirror(obj_3), (10 if len(I) == 15 else 4, 0))
  obj_1_new = shift(rot90(obj_1), (8 if len(I) != 9 else 2, 11 if len(I) != 9 else 3))
  return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj_3_new), obj_1_new)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract the objects with color 3 and color 1 from the input grid `I`.
2. **Transform Objects:**
   - Horizontally mirror `obj_3` and shift it down based on grid height (`10` units for height `15`, else `4`).
   - Rotate `obj_1` 90 degrees clockwise and shift it based on grid height (`(8, 11)` for heights other than `9`, else `(2, 3)`).
3. **Paint Objects:** Paint the transformed objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2 (Index-Based with Conditional Shift):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_3 = ofcolor(I, 3)
  indices_1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
  indices_3_new = shift(hmirror(indices_3), (10 if len(I) == 15 else 4, 0))
  indices_1_new = shift(rot90(toindices(indices_1)), (8 if len(I) != 9 else 2, 11 if len(I) != 9 else 3))
  return fill(fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, indices_3_new), 1, indices_1_new)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Indices:** Get the indices of cells with color 3 and 1.
2. **Transform Indices:** Apply the same transformations as in version 1, but to the indices directly.
3. **Fill Canvas:** Create a blank canvas and fill the transformed indices with the corresponding colors.

**Program Version 3 (Functional Composition with Conditional Shift):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = len(I)
  transform_3 = lambda obj: shift(hmirror(obj), (10 if h == 15 else 4, 0))
  transform_1 = lambda obj: shift(rot90(obj), (8, 11) if h != 9 else (2, 3))
  return paint(
      paint(
          canvas(0, shape(I)),
          transform_3(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3))
      ),
      transform_1(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Transformations:** Define functions `transform_3` and `transform_1` to encapsulate the object transformations, including the conditional shifts based on grid height.
2. **Extract & Transform:** Extract the objects and directly apply the transformations within the `paint` calls. 

**Program Version 4 (Subgrid-Based with Conditional Shift):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_3 = subgrid(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3), I)
  obj_1 = subgrid(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1), I)
  obj_3_new = shift(hmirror(obj_3), (10 if len(I) == 15 else 4, 0))
  obj_1_new = shift(rot90(obj_1), (8 if len(I) != 9 else 2, 11 if len(I) != 9 else 3))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(obj_3_new)), asobject(obj_1_new))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Subgrids:** Extract the subgrids containing the objects with color 3 and 1.
2. **Transform Subgrids:** Apply the transformations to the subgrids instead of the objects.
3. **Paint Subgrids:** Paint the transformed subgrids onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5 (Cell-wise Iteration with Conditional Transformation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if I[i][j] == 3:
                O = fill(O, 3, {(h - 1 - i + (10 if h == 15 else 4), j)})
            elif I[i][j] == 1:
                new_i, new_j = j, h - 1 - i
                if h != 9:
                    new_i, new_j = new_i + 8, new_j + 11
                else:
                    new_i, new_j = new_i + 2, new_j + 3
                O = fill(O, 1, {(new_i, new_j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Transform:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid. Apply the corresponding transformation based on cell color and grid height directly during iteration.
2. **Fill Canvas:** Fill the calculated target cell on a blank canvas.


These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformations, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.  Each version employs different logic and combinations of DSL functions, highlighting the diversity of potential solutions for a given transformation task.
