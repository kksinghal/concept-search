## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected groups of a specific digit (in these examples, it's the digit '1') and replacing them with a different digit (in these examples, it's the digit '3').  Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** 
All connected groups of '1's are replaced by '3's, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
The same logic applies here, with the connected '1's replaced by '3's, preserving the rest of the grid.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
Again, the transformation consistently replaces connected groups of '1's with '3's, leaving other digits untouched.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" achieving the desired transformation, using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract objects from the input grid
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, ONE) # Filter for objects with color '1'
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs) # Recolor the objects to '3'
  O = I # Initialize output as input
  for obj in recolored_objs: # Paint each recolored object onto the output grid
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O  
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`**: This line extracts all objects (connected groups of the same digit) from the input grid `I`. 
2.  **`filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, ONE)`**: This line filters the extracted objects to keep only those originally formed by the digit '1'.
3.  **`recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs)`**: This line iterates through the filtered objects and recolors them to the digit '3'.
4.  **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid.
5.  **`for obj in recolored_objs: O = paint(O, obj)`**: This loop paints each of the recolored objects onto the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F): # Iterate through each object in the input grid
    if color(obj) == ONE: # Check if the object's color is '1'
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, obj)) # Recolor to '3' and paint onto the canvas
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Otherwise, paint the object as is onto the canvas
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`**: Creates an empty grid (`O`) of the same dimensions as the input, filled with zeros.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, F): ...`**: Iterates through each object identified in the input grid.
3. **`if color(obj) == ONE: ...`**:  For each object, it checks if its color is '1'.
4. **`O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, obj))`**: If the object's color is '1', it is recolored to '3' and painted onto the canvas.
5. **`else: O = paint(O, obj)`**: If the object's color is not '1', it is painted onto the canvas without any changes.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  target_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Find indices of all '1's in the input grid
  O = I # Initialize output as input
  for i, j in target_indices: # Loop through the indices
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)}) # Fill each index with '3' in the output grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)`**: This line identifies and stores the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that contain the value '1'.
2. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
3. **`for i, j in target_indices: O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})`**: This loop iterates through each of the identified indices (where the input grid has a '1') and directly modifies the output grid `O` by changing the value at that index to '3'.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  return tuple( # Construct the output grid row by row
    tuple(
      THREE if v == ONE else v # Replace '1' with '3', keep other values
      for v in row
    ) 
    for row in I # Iterate through each row in the input grid
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions for a concise solution:

1. **`for row in I`**: Iterates through each row in the input grid `I`.
2. **`for v in row`**:  For each value `v` in the current row.
3. **`THREE if v == ONE else v`**:  If the value `v` is '1', it is replaced with '3'; otherwise, the original value is kept.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  replace_function = lambda v: THREE if v == ONE else v # Define a function to replace '1' with '3'
  return tuple( # Construct the output grid
    tuple(
      replace_function(v) # Apply the replacement function to each value
      for v in row
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to version 4, this one uses list comprehensions but introduces a separate `replace_function` for clarity:

1. **`replace_function = lambda v: THREE if v == ONE else v`**: Defines a lambda function `replace_function` that takes a value `v` and returns '3' if `v` is '1', otherwise it returns the original value.
2. The nested loop structure using list comprehensions remains the same, applying the `replace_function` to each element of the input grid to generate the output grid.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation within the constraints of the provided DSL. Each version highlights the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
