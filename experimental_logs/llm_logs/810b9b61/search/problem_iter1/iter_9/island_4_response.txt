## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontal lines of '1's that are at least three cells long and replacing them with '3's. Other digits and isolated '1's remain unchanged.

**Example:**

```
Input:            Output:
0 0 1 1 1 0      0 0 3 3 3 0 
0 1 0 1 0 0      0 1 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0      0 0 3 3 3 0
```

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == ONE and j + 2 < len(row) and \
        I[i][j] == I[i][j+1] == I[i][j+2] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, ((i, j), (i, j+1), (i, j+2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate:** Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for Horizontal Line:** If the current cell and the next two cells in the same row have the value '1', it's a horizontal line.
3. **Replace with '3's:** If a horizontal line is found, replace those cells with '3's using the `fill` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j in range(len(row) - 2):
      if tuple(I[i][j:j+3]) == (ONE, ONE, ONE):
        O = fill(O, THREE, ((i, j), (i, j+1), (i, j+2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate:** Loop through each cell (except the last two) in the grid.
2. **Check for Horizontal Line:** Extract a slice of three consecutive cells and check if it matches `(ONE, ONE, ONE)`.
3. **Replace with '3's:** If a match is found, replace those cells with '3's using the `fill` function.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  hlines = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: hline(obj) and len(obj) > 1)
  recolored_hlines = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), hlines)
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_hlines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** Identify all objects (connected components) in the grid.
2. **Filter Horizontal Lines:** Keep only the objects that are horizontal lines and longer than one cell.
3. **Recolor:** Recolor the selected horizontal lines to '3'.
4. **Paint:** Paint the recolored lines back onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if hline(obj) and size(obj) > 1:
      O = fill(O, THREE, toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:**  Identify all objects in the grid.
2. **Check and Replace:** For each object, check if it's a horizontal line longer than one cell and replace it with '3's using `fill`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def replace_line(row):
    return [THREE if j + 2 < len(row) and row[j] == row[j+1] == row[j+2] == ONE else v 
            for j, v in enumerate(row)]
  return tuple(tuple(replace_line(list(row))) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** `replace_line` replaces consecutive '1's in a row with '3's.
2. **Apply to Grid:** Apply the helper function to each row of the grid, effectively replacing horizontal lines of '1's with '3's.


These are just five examples. You can create many other variations using different DSL functions and logic combinations while still achieving the same transformation.
