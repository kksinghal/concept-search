## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves selectively recoloring objects formed by connected '1's in the input grid. 

* **Input_0:** Objects formed by connected '1's are recolored to '3' while preserving the rest of the grid.
* **Input_1:** Same as Input_0.
* **Input_2:** Same as Input_0.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) # Find connected objects of '1's
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, obj)) # Recolor each object to '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** Identifies connected objects formed by the digit '1' in the input grid `I`. `univalued=True` ensures only objects with the same value are grouped.
2. **Loop through `objs`:** Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`recolor(THREE, obj)`:** Changes the color of the current object `obj` to '3'.
4. **`paint(O, ...)`:**  Paints the recolored object onto a copy of the input grid `O`, effectively replacing the original object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Get indices of all '1's
  obj = toobject(indices, I) # Create an object from these indices
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, obj)) # Recolor and paint the object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Extracts the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` containing the value '1'.
2. **`toobject(indices, I)`:** Constructs an object representation using the extracted `indices` and their corresponding values from the input grid `I`.
3. **`recolor(THREE, obj)`:** Modifies the color of the constructed object `obj` to '3'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Applies the recolored object onto the input grid `I`, effectively changing the color of the target cells.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i,j)}) # Fill with '3' if cell value is '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** Loops through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Conditional filling:** If a cell contains the value '1', the `fill` function replaces it with '3' in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  mask = cellwise(I, canvas(ONE, shape(I)), ZERO) # Create a mask for '1's
  O = cellwise(mask, replace(I, ONE, THREE), I) # Apply recoloring based on the mask
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(ONE, shape(I))`:** Creates a grid of the same shape as the input, filled with '1's.
2. **`cellwise(..., ZERO)`:** Generates a mask by comparing the input grid with the canvas. Cells matching '1' in the input will be '1' in the mask, others will be '0'.
3. **`replace(I, ONE, THREE)`:** Creates a new grid where '1's in the input are replaced by '3's.
4. **`cellwise(..., I)`:** Merges the recolored grid with the original input based on the mask. Cells with '1' in the mask will take values from the recolored grid, others from the original input.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return replace(I, ONE, THREE) # Directly replace all '1's with '3's
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly utilizes the `replace` function to substitute all occurrences of '1' in the input grid with '3', offering the most concise solution. 

Each version utilizes different DSL functions and logic, showcasing diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation.
