## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves recoloring all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid to the digit '3' in the output grid, while leaving all other digits unchanged. 

**Let's break it down for each input-output pair:**

* **Pair 0:** All '1' digits in the input grid have been replaced with '3' in the output grid.  The positions of the '0' digits remain unchanged.
* **Pair 1:** Similar to Pair 0, only the '1' digits are replaced with '3'. The rest of the grid, primarily composed of '0's, remains the same.
* **Pair 2:** Again, the transformation only affects the '1' digits, changing them to '3' while preserving the positions of the '0' digits.

## Code Generation:

Given the analysis, the transformation can be achieved using a single line of code. Here are five different versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using distinct DSL functions and logic:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, ONE, THREE) 
```

**Explanation:**

* `replace(I, ONE, THREE)`: This function directly replaces all occurrences of the value `ONE` (which represents the digit '1') with the value `THREE` (representing the digit '3') in the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(replace(I, ONE, THREE), I, THREE)
```

**Explanation:**

* `replace(I, ONE, THREE)`: Same as in Version 1, this replaces all '1's with '3's.
* `cellwise(..., I, THREE)`: This function compares the modified grid (with '1's replaced by '3's) with the original grid `I`. For matching cells, it keeps the value from the modified grid. For non-matching cells, it defaults to `THREE`.  Since the only difference between the modified and original grids is the '1' to '3' change, this effectively retains the '3's and keeps the rest of the grid as is. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

* `objects(I, T, F, F)`: Extracts all objects (connected regions of the same digit) from the input grid `I`.
* `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with zeros.
* `lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj`: This lambda function checks if the color of an object is `ONE`. If it is, it recolors the object to `THREE`; otherwise, it leaves the object unchanged.
* `apply(..., objs)`: Applies the lambda function to each object extracted from the input grid.
* `merge(...)`: Merges the transformed objects back onto the blank canvas.
* `paint(...)`: Overlays the merged objects onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(THREE if v == ONE else v for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses list comprehension for a more Pythonic approach:
    * It iterates through each row and each value `v` within each row of the input grid `I`.
    * If `v` is equal to `ONE`, it's replaced with `THREE`. Otherwise, the original value `v` is kept.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = paint(cover(O, {(ONE, (i, j))}), {(THREE, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `O = I`: Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
* The nested loop iterates over each cell in the grid.
* `if I[i][j] == ONE`: If the current cell value is `ONE`:
    * `cover(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})`: "Erases" the cell at location `(i, j)` by setting its value to the background color. 
    * `paint(..., {(THREE, (i, j))})`:  Paints the erased cell with the value `THREE`, effectively replacing `ONE` with `THREE`. 

These five program versions showcase different ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL, demonstrating the flexibility and diversity of the DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, highlighting alternative approaches to problem-solving within the DSL's constraints.
