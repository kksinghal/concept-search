## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all objects (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid. The recoloring rule seems to be:

- **1s remain unchanged.**
- **Any other digit is replaced with a 3.** 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** All the 1s in the input remain 1s in the output.  The clusters of '1' digits remain unchanged while all other digits (in this case, only '0') are replaced by the digit '3'. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  Similar to the previous example, 1s are preserved and all other digits are replaced with 3s.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** This example reinforces the observation -  1s stay the same, and every other digit becomes a 3.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(replace(I, ZERO, THREE), TWO, THREE)
```

**Explanation:**
This version directly replaces all occurrences of 0s and 2s with 3s. Since 1s are not modified, they are effectively preserved.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  return paint(canvas(THREE, shape(I)), merge(sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)))
```

**Explanation:**
- It identifies all objects in the grid.
- Creates a canvas filled with 3s of the same size as the input grid.
- It then paints only the objects with color 1 onto the canvas, effectively achieving the desired transformation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(THREE if cell != ONE else ONE for cell in row) for row in I) 
```

**Explanation:** 
This version iterates through each cell in the grid. If the cell value is not 1, it's replaced with 3. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  condition = lambda x: x != ONE
  return tuple(tuple(branch(condition(cell), THREE, cell) for cell in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**
- It defines a condition function to check if a cell value is not equal to 1.
- Uses the 'branch' function to conditionally replace cell values. If the condition is true (cell value is not 1), it replaces with 3, otherwise keeps the original value. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return apply(lambda row: tuple(THREE if cell != ONE else ONE for cell in row), I)
```

**Explanation:**
This version uses the 'apply' function to apply a lambda function to each row of the grid. The lambda function replaces all non-1 values in the row with 3s.
