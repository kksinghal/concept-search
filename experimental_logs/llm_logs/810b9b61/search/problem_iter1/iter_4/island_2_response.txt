## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected '1's in the input grid and replacing them with '3's in the output grid. All other values in the grid remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  return paint(replace(I, ONE, THREE), objects(I, True, False, False))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, False)`: Identifies objects formed by connected '1's in the input grid 'I'.
2. `replace(I, ONE, THREE)`: Replaces all occurrences of '1' in the input grid with '3'.
3. `paint(...)`:  Overlays the objects identified in step 1 onto the modified grid from step 2, effectively replacing the '3's in the object locations with their original values. This ensures that only the background '1's are replaced with '3's.


**Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  return replace(I, ONE, branch(len(objs) > 0, THREE, ONE))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, False)`: Identifies objects formed by connected '1's in the input grid 'I'.
2. `branch(len(objs) > 0, THREE, ONE)`:  Checks if any objects were found. If objects exist (length of 'objs' is greater than 0), it returns '3'; otherwise, it returns '1'.
3. `replace(I, ONE, ...)`:  Replaces all occurrences of '1' in the input grid with the value returned by the `branch` function. If objects were found, the background '1's are replaced with '3's.


**Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE)
  return fill(I, THREE, obj_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. `asindices(I)`:  Gets the indices of all cells in the grid.
2. `lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE`: Defines a function that checks if the value at a given index 'loc' in the grid is equal to '1'.
3. `mfilter(..., ...)`: Filters the indices, keeping only those where the value in the grid is '1', representing the object cells.
4. `fill(I, THREE, ...)`: Fills the input grid 'I' with '3' at the indices of the object cells identified in the previous steps.


**Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(THREE, objects(I, True, False, False)))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid filled with '0's.
2.  `objects(I, True, False, False)`:  Identifies objects in the input grid.
3.  `recolor(THREE, ...)`: Recolors the identified objects to have a value of '3'.
4.  `paint(...)`:  Paints the recolored objects onto the blank canvas, resulting in the output grid.


**Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  def recolor_if_one(x): 
    return THREE if x == ONE else x
  return apply(lambda row: tuple(recolor_if_one(x) for x in row), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `def recolor_if_one(x)`: Defines a function to recolor a cell to '3' if its value is '1', otherwise keeps the original value.
2.  `apply(lambda row: ..., I)`: Iterates through each row of the input grid.
3.  `tuple(recolor_if_one(x) for x in row)`:  Applies the 'recolor_if_one' function to each cell in the current row.
4.  This nested loop approach allows for selectively recoloring cells that are '1' to '3' while preserving other values in the grid.
