## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '3' in the output grid. All other digits and their positions remain unchanged. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** All '1's are replaced by '3's while the rest of the grid remains identical. 
* **Input_1 to Output_1:**  The same '1' to '3' replacement occurs, leaving the rest of the grid unchanged.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** Similar to the previous examples, only the '1's are replaced by '3's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
This version directly utilizes the `replace` function from the DSL. It takes the input grid `I` and replaces all occurrences of `ONE` (which represents the digit '1') with `THREE` (representing the digit '3') to generate the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(THREE, ofcolor(I, ONE)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
This version first creates a blank canvas (`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`) of the same size as the input grid `I` filled with zeros. Then, it identifies the indices of all '1's in the input grid using `ofcolor(I, ONE)`. These indices are then used to create an object representing all '1' positions, which is then recolored to '3's using `recolor(THREE, indices)`. Finally, this recolored object is painted onto the blank canvas to generate the output grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)
  O = paint(cover(I, target_obj), recolor(THREE, target_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version first partitions the input grid into objects based on color using `partition(I)`. Then, it extracts the object composed of '1's using `extract` and a lambda function to identify the object with the color `ONE`. Next, it covers the original object in the input grid with the background color using `cover(I, target_obj)`. Finally, it recolors the extracted object to '3's with `recolor(THREE, target_obj)` and paints it back onto the grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i,j)) == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. If a cell contains a '1' (checked using `index(I, (i,j)) == ONE`), it replaces that specific cell in the output grid `O` with a '3' using `fill(O, THREE, {(i,j)})`.

**Program Version 5** 

```python
def solve(I):
  transformed_cells = prapply(
      lambda i, j: (THREE, (i, j)) if index(I, (i, j)) == ONE else (index(I, (i, j)), (i, j)), 
      interval(ZERO, height(I), ONE), 
      interval(ZERO, width(I), ONE)
  )
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), transformed_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version utilizes the `prapply` function to apply a transformation to every cell in the grid represented by the Cartesian product of row and column indices. For each cell, it checks if the value is '1'. If it is, the cell is transformed to have the value '3'; otherwise, it retains its original value. This creates a set of transformed cells, which is then painted onto a blank canvas to generate the final output grid.

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
