## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves recoloring objects formed by the digit '1' to the digit '3' while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged. 

**Let's break it down for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 - Output_0:** All occurrences of connected '1's are replaced with '3's.
* **Input_1 - Output_1:** Similar to the previous pair, '1's are replaced by '3's.
* **Input_2 - Output_2:** The same recoloring logic applies here.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(replace(I, ONE, ZERO), recolor(THREE, asobject(replace(I, ONE, THREE))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **replace(I, ONE, THREE):**  Replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3' in the input grid `I`.
2. **asobject(...):** Converts the resulting grid into an object representation.
3. **recolor(THREE, ...):** Ensures the object has a color value of '3'.
4. **replace(I, ONE, ZERO):** Creates a copy of the input grid `I` and replaces all '1's with '0's. This effectively removes the original '1' objects.
5. **paint(..., ...):**  Paints the recoloured object (originally '1's, now '3's) onto the grid where '1's were removed. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  return paint(I, merge({recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj)==ONE else obj for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **objects(I, T, F, T):** Extracts objects from the input grid `I` (connected components of the same color, excluding background).
2. **{recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj)==ONE else obj for obj in objs}:**  Iterates through each extracted object. If the object's color is '1', it recolors it to '3'; otherwise, it keeps the object unchanged.
3. **merge(...):**  Combines all the modified (and unmodified) objects back into a single object set.
4. **paint(I, ...):** Paints the final set of objects onto a copy of the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(replace(I, ONE, ZERO), THREE, ofcolor(I, ONE))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ofcolor(I, ONE):**  Gets the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the value '1'.
2. **replace(I, ONE, ZERO):** Creates a copy of the input grid `I` and replaces all occurrences of '1' with '0'.
3. **fill(..., THREE, ...):**  Fills the grid from step 2 with the value '3' at the indices obtained in step 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterates** through every cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **If** a cell's value is '1', it paints a new cell with value '3' at the same location on a copy of the grid (`O`).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(THREE, asobject(replace(I, ONE, THREE))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **shape(I):**  Gets the dimensions (height, width) of the input grid `I`.
2. **canvas(ZERO, ...):**  Creates a new grid filled with '0's, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **replace(I, ONE, THREE):**  Replaces all '1's with '3's in the input grid.
4. **asobject(...):**  Converts the grid with replaced values into an object representation.
5. **recolor(THREE, ...):** Ensures the object has a color value of '3'.
6. **paint(..., ...):**  Paints the recoloured object onto the canvas of '0's.
