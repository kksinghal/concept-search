## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '3' in the output grid. All other digits remain unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, ONE, THREE) 
```

**Explanation:**

This program leverages the `replace` function from the DSL. 

1. **`replace(I, ONE, THREE)`:** This directly replaces all instances of `ONE` (which represents the digit '1') in the input grid `I` with `THREE` (representing the digit '3'). 

This effectively implements the observed transformation in a concise and efficient manner.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  return paint(I, merge(recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes object-based manipulation:

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all distinct connected objects within the grid `I`. `T, F, F` configures the function to consider objects formed by connected cells of the same value, ignoring diagonal connections and including background objects.
2. **`paint(I, merge(recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj for obj in objs))`:**
   - Iterates through each object `obj` in the identified `objs`.
   - `if color(obj) == ONE` : If the object's color is '1', it recolors it to '3' using `recolor(THREE, obj)`.
   - Otherwise, the object remains unchanged.
   - `merge(...)`: Merges all the modified (or unmodified) objects back together.
   - `paint(I, ...)`:  Paints the merged objects onto the original grid `I`, effectively replacing the '1' objects with '3' while preserving the rest.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(THREE, asobject(replace(I, ONE, THREE))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version constructs the output by painting the modified objects onto a blank canvas:

1. **`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid `I`, filled with zeros.
2. **`replace(I, ONE, THREE)`:**  Replaces all instances of '1' with '3' in the input grid.
3. **`asobject(...)`:** Converts the modified grid into an object representation.
4. **`recolor(THREE, ...)`:** Since the object now contains '3' where '1's were, this ensures the object retains the color '3'.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the recolored object onto the blank canvas. The result is the desired output grid with '1's replaced by '3's.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_to_change = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  return fill(I, THREE, indices_to_change)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses index-based modification:

1. **`indices_to_change = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the color '1'.
2. **`fill(I, THREE, indices_to_change)`:**  Fills the cells at the identified indices in the input grid `I` with the color '3'. This directly modifies the input grid, producing the desired output.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(THREE if v == ONE else v for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version employs a Python list comprehension for a direct and intuitive approach:

1. **`(THREE if v == ONE else v for v in row)`:** Iterates through each value `v` within each row of the input grid `I`. If `v` is equal to `ONE` (representing '1'), it's replaced with `THREE` ('3'). Otherwise, the original value is retained.
2. **`tuple(tuple(...) for row in I)`:**  Applies the inner comprehension to each row in the grid, effectively replacing all occurrences of '1' with '3' while maintaining the grid structure.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation within the provided DSL, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the DSL's functions.
