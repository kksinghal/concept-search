## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in each example involves recoloring all objects (connected regions of the same digit) where the digit '1' is present to the digit '3'. All other digits and the background remain unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All objects containing the digit '1' are recolored to '3'.  

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The same logic applies. Only objects containing '1' are recolored. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Again, only the object containing the digit '1' changes color to '3'.


## Program to be Generated (5 Versions)

**Version 1: Using `objects`, `recolor`, and set comprehension**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, {recolor(THREE, obj) if ONE in palette(obj) else obj for obj in objects(I, False, False, False)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, False, False, False)`:**  Identifies all connected objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **Set Comprehension:** Iterates through each `obj` in the set of objects. 
   - **`ONE in palette(obj)`:** Checks if the digit '1' is present in the object's palette (set of colors).
   - **`recolor(THREE, obj)`:** If '1' is present, the object is recolored to '3'.
   - **`else obj`:** Otherwise, the object remains unchanged. 
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the modified objects back onto the original input grid `I`.

**Version 2: Using `asobject`, `replace`, and conditional recoloring**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(replace(I, ONE, ZERO), recolor(THREE, asobject(replace(I, ONE, THREE)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`replace(I, ONE, THREE)`:**  Replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3' in the input grid.
2.  **`asobject(...)`:**  Converts the entire modified grid into a single object.
3.  **`recolor(THREE, ...)`:** Recolors this object (which now has all the original '1's as '3's) to '3'.
4.  **`replace(I, ONE, ZERO)`:**  Creates a copy of the input grid where all '1's are replaced with '0's (effectively erasing the original '1's).
5.  **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the recolored object onto the grid where '1's were erased, resulting in only the objects that originally contained '1' being recolored to '3'.

**Version 3: Using `partition` and filtering**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, {obj if color(obj) != ONE else recolor(THREE, obj) for obj in partition(I)})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`partition(I)`:** Divides the input grid `I` into objects based on connected components.
2.  **Set comprehension:** For each object `obj`:
    -   **`if color(obj) != ONE`:** If the object's color is not '1', it's kept as is.
    -   **`else recolor(THREE, obj)`:** If the object's color is '1', it's recolored to '3'.
3.  **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the modified objects onto the original input grid.

**Version 4:  Using `fgpartition` and merging**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    return paint(I, merge([objs - colorfilter(objs, ONE),  recolor(THREE, merge(colorfilter(objs, ONE)))]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Partitions the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`colorfilter(objs, ONE)`:**  Filters for objects with color '1'.
3. **`objs - ...`:**  Removes objects with color '1' from the original set.
4. **`recolor(THREE, merge(...))`:**  Recolors the filtered objects (those with color '1') to '3'.
5. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the unchanged objects and recolored objects.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the final set of objects onto the input grid. 

**Version 5: Using `objects`, `apply`, and merging**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  return paint(I, merge([apply(lambda obj: obj if color(obj) != ONE else recolor(THREE, obj), objs)])) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objects(I, False, False, False)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2.  **`apply(...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object:
    -   **`lambda obj: obj if color(obj) != ONE else recolor(THREE, obj)`:**  Keeps the object if its color is not '1'; otherwise, it recolors the object to '3'.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the modified objects back into a single set. 
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the final set of objects onto the input grid. 


## Note:

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation.  They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL, allowing for a variety of solutions.
