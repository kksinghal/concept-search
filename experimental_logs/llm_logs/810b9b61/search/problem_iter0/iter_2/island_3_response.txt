## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors all objects consisting solely of the digit '1' to the digit '3', while leaving all other digits untouched.

**Input 0:** All '1' objects are recolored to '3', while the objects formed by '11' and the individual '1' remain unchanged.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, all '1' objects are recolored to '3'.

**Input 2:** The same recoloring logic applies, with all '1' objects becoming '3' objects.

## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated:** 

```python
def recolor_ones_to_threes(I):
  """
  Recolors all objects consisting solely of '1's to '3's.
  """
  ones = objects(I, True, True, False)  # Identify '1' objects
  threes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), ones)  # Recolor to '3'
  O = I  # Initialize output grid
  for obj in ones:
    O = cover(O, obj)  # Remove original '1' objects
  for obj in threes:
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint the recolored '3' objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:** `ones = objects(I, True, True, False)` identifies objects formed solely by '1's in the input grid `I`.
2. **Recolor to '3':** `threes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), ones)` creates a new set of objects (`threes`) by recoloring each object in `ones` to '3'.
3. **Initialize output:** `O = I` initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
4. **Remove '1' objects:** The code iterates through each object in `ones` and uses `O = cover(O, obj)` to replace the '1' objects in the output grid with the background color.
5. **Paint '3' objects:** The code then iterates through each object in `threes` and uses `O = paint(O, obj)` to paint the recolored '3' objects onto the output grid.
6. **Return Output:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned.

**This program effectively implements the observed transformation by identifying and recoloring the '1' objects while preserving the rest of the grid.**
