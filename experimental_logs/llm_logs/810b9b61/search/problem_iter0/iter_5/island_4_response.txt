## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects within the input grid and recoloring them with a new color. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** All objects formed by the digit '1' are recolored to the digit '3'.

**Input_1 - Output_1:** Only the object formed by the digit '1' in the top half of the grid is recolored to '3'.

**Input_2 - Output_2:** Similar to Input_0 - Output_0, all objects formed by the digit '1' are recolored to '3'.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Identify all objects formed by the digit '1'
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)

    # Recolor the target objects to '3'
    recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)

    # Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target objects:** We find all objects formed by '1' using `objects` and filter them using `colorfilter`.
2. **Recolor:** We recolor the target objects to '3' using `recolor` and `mapply`.
3. **Paint:** Finally, we create a blank canvas and paint the recolored objects onto it using `canvas`, `merge`, and `paint`.

**Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Create a mask by replacing '1' with '3' and other digits with '0'
    mask = replace(I, 1, 3)
    O = cellwise(I, mask, 0)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a mask:** We create a new grid (`mask`) where '1' is replaced with '3' and all other digits are replaced with '0'.
2. **Apply the mask:** We use `cellwise` to compare the input grid with the `mask`. If the digits match, the digit from the input grid is kept. Otherwise, '0' is used, effectively recoloring only the target objects.

**Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Find the indices of all occurrences of '1'
    indices = ofcolor(I, 1)

    # Fill those indices with '3' on a blank canvas
    O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find target indices:** We directly find the indices of all occurrences of '1' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Fill indices:** We create a blank canvas and fill the identified indices with '3' using `canvas` and `fill`.

**Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Split the grid horizontally
    top, bottom = tophalf(I), bottomhalf(I)

    # Recolor objects formed by '1' in the top half
    recolored_top = fill(canvas(0, shape(top)), 3, ofcolor(top, 1))

    # Combine the recolored top half with the original bottom half
    O = vconcat(recolored_top, bottom)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split and recolor:** We split the grid horizontally. Then, we recolor objects formed by '1' only in the top half of the grid.
2. **Combine:** We combine the recolored top half with the original bottom half to obtain the final output.

**Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Create a function to recolor an object based on its color
    def recolor_object(obj):
      return recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj

    # Find all objects and apply the recoloring function
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    recolored_objs = apply(recolor_object, objs)

    # Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define recolor function:** We define a custom function `recolor_object` that takes an object as input and recolors it to '3' only if its original color is '1'.
2. **Apply recolor function:** We apply this function to all objects in the grid using `apply` and then paint them onto a blank canvas.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL. Each version uses distinct logic or DSL function combinations, offering a diverse set of solutions.
