## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces all occurrences of a specific color (in this case, '1') in the input grid with a different color (in this case, '3') while keeping all other elements unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- All occurrences of '1' are replaced with '3'. 
- All other elements remain the same.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- All occurrences of '1' are replaced with '3'.
- All other elements remain the same.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- All occurrences of '1' are replaced with '3'.
- All other elements remain the same.


## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
  O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `replace` function directly to achieve the transformation.

- `replace(I, ONE, THREE)`: This replaces all occurrences of the value `ONE` (1) in the input grid `I` with the value `THREE` (3), effectively achieving the desired color replacement. 


### Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, ONE)
  recolored_objs = mapply(rbind(recolor, THREE), target_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version breaks down the transformation into object-based operations.

- `partition(I)`:  Divides the input grid `I` into distinct objects based on cell values.
- `colorfilter(objs, ONE)`: Filters the objects to select only those containing the color `ONE` (1).
- `mapply(rbind(recolor, THREE), target_objs)`: Applies the `recolor` function to each selected object, changing their color to `THREE` (3).
- `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the recolored objects onto it. 


### Version 3:

```python
def solve(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  O = fill(I, THREE, indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on identifying and filling target indices.

- `ofcolor(I, ONE)`:  Retrieves the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the value `ONE` (1).
- `fill(I, THREE, indices)`: Fills the cells at the obtained indices with the value `THREE` (3), directly modifying the input grid.


### Version 4:

```python
def solve(I):
  def recolor_condition(v, _): 
    return (THREE, (v[1])) if v[0] == ONE else v
  O = frozenset(map(recolor_condition, asobject(I)))
  return totuple(totuple(x) for x in O)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a custom function and applies it cell-by-cell.

- `def recolor_condition(v, _)`: Defines a function that takes a cell (value, index) and checks if the value is `ONE` (1). If so, it returns a new cell with the value `THREE` (3) and the same index. Otherwise, it returns the original cell.
- `frozenset(map(recolor_condition, asobject(I)))`: Converts the grid into an object, applies the `recolor_condition` function to each cell, and stores the result in a new frozenset.
- `totuple(totuple(x) for x in O)`: Converts the resulting frozenset back into a tuple-based grid format.

### Version 5:

```python
def solve(I):
  O = tuple(tuple(THREE if v == ONE else v for v in row) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions for a concise solution.

- `tuple(tuple(THREE if v == ONE else v for v in row) for row in I)`:  Iterates through each row and each cell within the row. If the cell value is `ONE` (1), it replaces it with `THREE` (3); otherwise, it keeps the original value. The result is converted back into a tuple-based grid.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same color replacement transformation within the provided DSL, highlighting its flexibility and expressiveness.
