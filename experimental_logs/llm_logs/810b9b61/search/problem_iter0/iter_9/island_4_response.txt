## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected '1's in the input grid and replacing them with '3's in the output grid. All other digits in the grid remain unchanged. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 - Output_0:** All connected groups of '1's are replaced by '3's. For example, the top-right group of '1 1 1' becomes '3 3 3'. 
* **Input_1 - Output_1:** Similar to the previous example, the two groups of connected '1's are replaced by '3's.
* **Input_2 - Output_2:**  The large connected '1' object and the two smaller '1 1' objects are all replaced by '3's.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_99b1bc43(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Find connected objects of '1's
    target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)  # Select objects with color '1'
    target_indices = mapply(toindices, target_objs) # Get indices of cells in target objects
    O = fill(I, 3, target_indices)  # Fill those indices with '3' 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:**  Finds all connected objects in the grid `I`. `True` indicates the objects should be univalued (all '1's), `False` indicates we are not considering diagonal connections, and the last `False` means we are not excluding any background color.
2.  **`colorfilter(objs, 1)`:**  Filters the found objects to keep only those with color '1'.
3.  **`mapply(toindices, target_objs)`:**  Extracts the indices of all cells belonging to the target objects.
4.  **`fill(I, 3, target_indices)`:**  Fills the input grid `I` with '3' at the extracted target indices.
5.  **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid `O`.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_99b1bc43(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas with the background color
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False): # Iterate over connected objects
    if color(obj) == 1: # Check if the object's color is '1'
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj)) # Recolor the object to '3' and paint it on the canvas
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid `O` of the same size as the input `I` and filled with the most common color (background) of `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):`:** Iterates over each connected object found in `I`.
3. **`if color(obj) == 1:`:**  Checks if the current object's color is '1'.
4. **`O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj))`:** Recolors the current object to '3' and paints it onto the canvas `O`.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the modified canvas `O`.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_99b1bc43(I):
  indices_to_change = set() # Initialize an empty set to store indices
  for i in range(len(I)): # Iterate through rows
    for j in range(len(I[0])): # Iterate through columns
      if I[i][j] == 1: # Check if the cell value is '1'
        indices_to_change.add((i, j)) # If '1', add the index to the set
  O = fill(I, 3, frozenset(indices_to_change)) # Fill the input grid with '3' at the collected indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`indices_to_change = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store the indices of cells that need to be changed to '3'.
2. **Nested loops:** Iterates over each cell in the input grid `I`.
3. **`if I[i][j] == 1:`:** Checks if the current cell's value is '1'.
4. **`indices_to_change.add((i, j))`:** If the cell value is '1', its index `(i, j)` is added to the `indices_to_change` set.
5. **`O = fill(I, 3, frozenset(indices_to_change))`:** Fills the input grid `I` with '3' at all the indices stored in `indices_to_change`.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid `O`. 


**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_99b1bc43(I):
  target_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of cells with color '1'
  O = fill(I, 3, target_indices) # Fill those indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Directly obtains the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the color '1'.
2. **`O = fill(I, 3, target_indices)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the color '3' at the identified target indices.
3. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_99b1bc43(I):
  return tuple(tuple(3 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row) for row in I) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses list comprehension for a concise solution:

1. **`tuple(tuple(... for cell in row) for row in I)`:**  This part iterates over each row and each cell within the input grid `I`.
2. **`3 if cell == 1 else cell`:** For each cell, it checks if the value is '1'. If it is, it replaces it with '3'; otherwise, it keeps the cell value unchanged.
3. **`return ...`:** Returns the modified grid. 

Each program version utilizes different DSL functions or approaches to achieve the same transformation. You can choose the one that you find most readable or efficient for your needs.
