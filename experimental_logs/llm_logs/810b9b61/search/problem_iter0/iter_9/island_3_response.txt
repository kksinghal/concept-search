## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves recoloring all objects composed entirely of the color '1' to the color '3'. Other objects and the background remain unchanged. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** All occurrences of connected '1's are replaced by '3's. The isolated '1's within other objects remain unchanged.

**Input_1 - Output_1:** Similar to the previous example, only connected '1' objects are recolored.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**  Again, the transformation successfully recolors the connected '1' object while leaving other elements untouched.


## Program to be Generated (5 Versions)

**Version 1: Using 'objects' and 'colorfilter'**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Extract all univalued objects
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)    # Select objects with color '1'
  recolored_objs = apply(rbind(recolor, 3), target_objs) # Recolor selected objects to '3'
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint recolored objects onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:**  Extracts all univalued objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`colorfilter(objs, 1)`:** Filters the extracted objects, keeping only those with color '1'.
3. **`apply(rbind(recolor, 3), target_objs)`:**  Applies the `recolor` function to each object in `target_objs`, changing their color to '3'.
4. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid and paints the recolored objects onto it.

**Version 2: Using 'partition' and list comprehension**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I) # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  recolored_objs = [recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj for obj in objs] # Recolor objects if their color is '1'
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`partition(I)`:** Divides the input grid into objects where each object consists of cells with the same color.
2. **`[recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj for obj in objs]`:**  Iterates through the objects and recolors those with color '1' to '3' while keeping others unchanged.
3. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))`:**  Similar to Version 1, paints the transformed objects onto a blank canvas.

**Version 3: Using 'ofcolor' and 'fill'**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all cells with color '1'
  O = fill(I, 3, indices) # Fill the indices with color '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Retrieves the indices of all cells in the input grid that have the color '1'.
2. **`fill(I, 3, indices)`:**  Overwrites the original grid `I` by changing the color at the specified indices to '3'.


**Version 4:  Combining 'objects' and 'fill'**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Extract univalued objects
  target_indices = merge([toindices(obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1]) # Extract indices of objects with color '1' 
  O = fill(I, 3, target_indices) # Fill the extracted indices with color '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Extracts all univalued objects from the input grid.
2. **`merge([toindices(obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1])`:**  Iterates through the objects, extracts indices of those with color '1', and merges them into a single set.
3. **`fill(I, 3, target_indices)`:** Changes the color of cells at the collected indices to '3' in the input grid.

**Version 5: Using nested loops and conditional replacement**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = [[3 if I[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`[[3 if I[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]`:**  Uses nested list comprehension to iterate through every cell in the grid. If a cell's color is '1', it's replaced by '3'; otherwise, it remains unchanged. 
3. **`tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)`:** Converts the resulting list of lists back into a tuple of tuples, representing the final grid.

Each of these five versions provides a distinct approach to solve the recoloring task while adhering to the provided DSL.
