## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to replace objects made of `1`s with objects made of `3`s. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

* All objects formed by the digit `1` are replaced with the digit `3`. The shape and position of the objects remain identical.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

*  The same logic applies. Only the `1` objects are re-colored to `3`.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* Again,  all occurrences of `1` objects are replaced with `3` objects, maintaining shape and position.


##  Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    """
    Replaces all objects made of '1' with '3'.
    """
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Extract all objects from the input grid
    target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1) # Filter for objects with color '1'
    recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs) # Recolor the selected objects to '3'
    O = I # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input
    for obj in recolored_objs:
        O = paint(O, obj) # Paint each recolored object onto the output grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the grid using `objects`.
2. **Filter Target:** Isolate the objects composed of the color `1` using `colorfilter`.
3. **Recolor:** Change the color of the filtered objects to `3` with `recolor`.
4. **Paint Output:** Overlay the recolored objects onto a copy of the input grid using `paint`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Replaces '1's with '3's directly on the grid.
  """
  O = tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Replace:** This version iterates through each cell in the input grid (`I`). 
2. **Conditional Replacement:** If the cell value (`v`) is `1`, it's replaced with `3`; otherwise, the original value is kept. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Uses replace function for direct substitution.
  """
  O = replace(I, 1, 3) # Replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Substitution:** This concise version leverages the `replace` function to directly substitute all instances of `1` with `3` in the input grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    """
    Finds indices of '1' and fills with '3'.
    """
    indices_to_change = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of cells containing '1'
    O = fill(I, 3, indices_to_change) # Fill those indices with '3'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Target:** Identify the indices of all cells with the value `1` using `ofcolor`.
2. **Fill:** Directly modify the input grid by changing the value at the identified indices to `3` with `fill`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    """
    Iterative approach to replacing '1's with '3's. 
    """
    O = list(list(row) for row in I)  # Create a mutable copy of the grid
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == 1:
                O[i][j] = 3  # Modify the copy if the value is '1'
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O) # Convert back to immutable tuples 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mutable Copy:** Creates a mutable nested list representation of the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Modify:**  Iterates through each cell, replacing `1`s with `3`s directly in the mutable copy.
3. **Immutable Output:** Converts the modified nested list back into an immutable tuple of tuples.

These five versions showcase a variety of approaches to solving the problem within the DSL constraints.
