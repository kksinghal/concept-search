## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '3' in the output grid. All other digits and their positions remain unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3'.
    """
    O = replace(I, 1, 3)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `replace` function directly. It takes the input grid `I`, finds all instances of '1' (`replacee`), and substitutes them with '3' (`replacer`). The modified grid is then returned as output `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3'.
    """
    objs = partition(I)
    target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
    recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for obj in recolored_objs:
        O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first partitions the input grid `I` into objects based on color using `partition`. It identifies objects consisting only of '1' using `colorfilter`. Next, it recolors these objects to '3' using `recolor` and `mapply`. Finally, it creates a blank canvas `O` and paints the recolored objects onto it.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3'.
    """
    indices_to_change = ofcolor(I, 1)
    O = I
    for i, j in indices_to_change:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies the indices of all '1's in the input grid `I` using `ofcolor`. It then iterates through these indices and uses the `fill` function to change the value at each index to '3'.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3'.
    """
    return tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses list comprehension for a concise solution. It iterates through each row and cell in the input grid `I`, replacing '1's with '3's and keeping other values unchanged.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3'.
    """
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) == 1:
                O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over each cell in the grid using nested loops with `height` and `width`.  It checks the value at each location using `index`, and if it's '1', it uses `fill` to change it to '3' in the output grid `O`.

These five versions demonstrate various approaches to accomplish the same goal, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each solution leverages different functions and strategies, offering diverse and efficient ways to achieve the desired transformation.
