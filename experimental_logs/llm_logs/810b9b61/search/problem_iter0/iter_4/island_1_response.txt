## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected cells of the same color (excluding the background color) and recoloring them. The target color appears to be based on the size of the object:

* **Largest object:** Recolored to '3'
* **Smallest object:**  Recolored to '1' 
* **All other objects:** Remain unchanged

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

* The largest object (1s) is recolored to '3'.
* The smallest object (double 1s at the top right) remains '1'.
* The remaining object (single '1') is unchanged.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

* The largest object (connected 1s) is recolored to '3'.
* There are multiple smallest objects (single 1s), all remain '1'.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

* The largest object (connected 1s) is recolored to '3'.
* The smallest object (double 1s) remains '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:


**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background
    largest = argmax(objs, size)  # Find the largest object
    smallest = argmin(objs, size)  # Find the smallest object
    I = paint(I, recolor(3, largest))  # Recolor the largest object to '3'
    I = paint(I, recolor(1, smallest))  # Recolor the smallest object to '1'
    return I  # Return the transformed grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies and extracts all objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Find Largest & Smallest:** `argmax(objs, size)` and `argmin(objs, size)` identify the largest and smallest objects respectively based on their size.
3. **Recolor:** `recolor(3, largest)` and `recolor(1, largest)` create new objects identical to the largest and smallest but with colors '3' and '1' respectively.
4. **Paint:** `paint(I, ...)` overlays the recolored objects onto the input grid, effectively replacing their original colors.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    s = size(objs) #Getting the size of the objects
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas with background color
    for i in range(s):
      obj = extract(objs, lambda o: size(o) == maximum(frozenset({size(obj) for obj in objs}))) # Finding the largest object
      objs = remove(obj, objs)
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj)) # Painting the largest object with color '3'
    for i in range(s):
      obj = extract(objs, lambda o: size(o) == minimum(frozenset({size(obj) for obj in objs}))) # Finding the smallest object
      objs = remove(obj, objs)
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, obj)) # Painting the smallest object with color '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and get size:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects, and  `size(objs)` gets the count of the objects.
2. **Blank Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Recolor Largest:** The first loop iterates through the objects. `extract(...)` finds the largest object, removes it from `objs`, and paints it onto the canvas with color '3'.
4. **Iterate and Recolor Smallest:** The second loop does the same for the smallest object, recoloring it to '1'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  largest_size = size(argmax(objs, size))
  smallest_size = size(argmin(objs, size))
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj) if size(obj) == largest_size else (recolor(1, obj) if size(obj) == smallest_size else obj), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects from the input.
2. **Find Largest & Smallest Sizes:**  Get the sizes of the largest and smallest objects using `size(argmax(objs, size))` and `size(argmin(objs, size))`.
3. **Recolor Based on Size:** `apply(lambda obj: ...)` iterates through each object and recolors it based on its size. If it's the largest, it's recolored to '3', if it's the smallest, it's recolored to '1', otherwise, it remains unchanged.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** The recolored objects are merged and painted onto a blank canvas to create the final output.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) == size(argmax(objs, size)):
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj))
    if size(obj) == size(argmin(objs, size)):
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies and extracts objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** The code iterates through each extracted object. If the current object's size matches the largest object's size, it is recolored to '3'. Similarly, if it matches the smallest object's size, it's recolored to '1'. 
3. **Update Grid:** The `paint(O, recolor(..., obj))` function overlays the recolored object directly onto the grid `O`, effectively replacing the original object's color. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    def recolor_func(obj):
        if size(obj) == size(argmax(objs, size)):
            return recolor(3, obj)
        elif size(obj) == size(argmin(objs, size)):
            return recolor(1, obj)
        else:
            return obj
    recolored = apply(recolor_func, objs)
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all distinct objects from the input grid.
2. **Define Recoloring Logic:** `recolor_func(obj)` determines the new color for an object. If it's the largest, it returns a recolor to '3', if it's the smallest, it returns a recolor to '1', otherwise, it returns the object unchanged.
3. **Apply Recoloring:** `apply(recolor_func, objs)` applies the `recolor_func` to each object in the `objs` set.
4. **Combine and Paint:** The recolored objects are merged using `merge(recolored)` and then painted onto a new canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic. Each version accomplishes the task while showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
