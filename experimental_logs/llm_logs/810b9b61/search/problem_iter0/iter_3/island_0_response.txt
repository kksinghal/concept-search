## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors all objects with the color '1' to the color '3', while leaving all other colors and their spatial relationships unchanged. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0 to Output_0**: All occurrences of '1' in various objects are replaced with '3'. The background (color '0') and the object containing '1' in the bottom right corner are unchanged.
* **Input_1 to Output_1**: The two objects containing '1' have their color changed to '3'.  The background remains untouched.
* **Input_2 to Output_2**: Similar to the previous cases, only the objects containing '1' are recolored to '3'. The background and the object containing '1' in the bottom right corner remain unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through the grid and recolors cells with value '1' to '3'.
  """
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      O = paint(O, {(3 if I[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j], (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **Iteration and Recoloring:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. If the cell value is '1', it paints the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` with '3'; otherwise, it paints the original cell value.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses `objects` and `mapply` to recolor objects containing '1' to '3'.
  """
  objs = objects(I, False, True, False) # Identify all objects
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj, objs) # Recolor if color is 1
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create canvas
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint objects onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Selective Recoloring:** Uses `mapply` to recolor objects. For each object, it checks if its color is '1'. If so, it recolors the object to '3'; otherwise, the object remains unchanged.
3. **Painting:** Paints all the recolored objects onto a blank canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Finds indices of '1' and replaces them with '3' using `replace`
  """
  indices_of_ones = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of all '1's
  O = replace(I, 1, 3) # Replace all '1's with '3's
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Indices:**  `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies the indices of all cells in the grid containing the value '1'.
2. **Direct Replacement:** `replace(I, 1, 3)` directly replaces all occurrences of '1' in the input grid `I` with '3', generating the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses nested list comprehension for in-place recoloring.
  """
  O = tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Nested Comprehension:**  Utilizes nested list comprehension to iterate through each cell (`v`) in each row of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Conditional Recoloring:**  For each cell, it checks if the value `v` is equal to '1'. If true, it replaces the cell value with '3'; otherwise, it retains the original value. This process effectively recolors all '1's to '3's while preserving other values.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Constructs the output grid by mapping cell values using a lambda function.
  """
  O = tuple(tuple(map(lambda v: 3 if v == 1 else v, row)) for row in I)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Lambda Function for Recoloring:** Defines a lambda function that takes a cell value `v` as input.  If `v` is equal to '1', it returns '3'; otherwise, it returns the original value `v`.
2. **Mapping and Tuple Construction:** Uses nested tuple construction and the `map` function to apply the lambda function to each cell in each row of the input grid (`I`). This generates a new grid (`O`) with the '1' values recolored to '3'.
