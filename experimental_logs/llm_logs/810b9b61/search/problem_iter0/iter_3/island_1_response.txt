## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (in this case, color 1) and recoloring them to a target color (color 3). Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** All objects with color 1 are recolored to 3.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Same as above, all objects with color 1 are recolored to 3.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**  Again, all objects with color 1 are recolored to 3.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return replace(I, ONE, THREE)
```

**Explanation:** 

This version directly uses the `replace` function to substitute all occurrences of color 1 with color 3 in the input grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* It identifies all objects in the input grid using `objects`.
* It iterates through each object.
* If the object's color is 1 (`color(obj) == ONE`), it recolors the object to 3 (`recolor(THREE, obj)`) and paints it onto the output grid (`paint(O, ...)`). 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  target_color = THREE
  objs = partition(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, obj if color(obj) != ONE else recolor(target_color, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* It partitions the grid into objects based on color using `partition`.
* It initializes an empty canvas (`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`).
* For each object, it either paints the object as is or recolors it to the target color (3) if its color is 1, and then paints it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  indices_to_recolor = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  O = I
  for i, j in indices_to_recolor:
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* It identifies indices of cells with color 1 using `ofcolor`.
* It iterates through these indices and fills each corresponding cell in the output grid with color 3 using `fill`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def recolor_condition(x): return x == ONE
  return apply(lambda cell: THREE if recolor_condition(cell) else cell, I)
```

**Explanation:**

* It defines a `recolor_condition` function to check if a cell's value is 1.
* It uses `apply` to apply a lambda function to each cell in the grid. 
* The lambda function checks the `recolor_condition` and replaces the cell value with 3 if the condition is true, otherwise, it keeps the original value.
