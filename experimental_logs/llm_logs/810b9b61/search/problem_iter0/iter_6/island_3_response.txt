## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' in the input grid and recoloring them to the digit '3' in the output grid, while maintaining all other digits and their positions.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- Objects formed by '1' are identified and recolored to '3'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
-  Same as above.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
-  Same as above.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Identify all objects in the grid
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)  # Filter objects with color '1'
  recolored_objs = mapply(rbind(recolor, 3), filtered_objs) # Recolor to '3'
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected components ('objects') of the same value in the grid. 
2. **Filter by color:** `colorfilter(objs, 1)` isolates the objects formed by the digit '1'.
3. **Recolor:** `mapply(rbind(recolor, 3), filtered_objs)` applies the `recolor` function to each object, changing their color to '3'.
4. **Paint on canvas:** `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, then paints the recolored objects onto it.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_if_one(v, loc):
    return (3, loc) if v == 1 else (v, loc)
  O = frozenset(map(recolor_if_one, asobject(I))) # Apply recoloring logic
  return totuple(totuple(x) for x in O) # Format output as a tuple of tuples
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Convert to object:** `asobject(I)` transforms the input grid into a set of (value, location) tuples.
2. **Apply recoloring:** `map(recolor_if_one, asobject(I))` iterates through each cell and applies the `recolor_if_one` function, which changes the color to '3' if the original value is '1', otherwise keeps the original value.
3. **Format output:**  The resulting set is converted back into a tuple of tuples to match the desired output format.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(tuple(3 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row) for row in I) # Directly recolor '1' to '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to directly recolor cells with value '1' to '3' while iterating through the input grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Find indices of cells with '1'
  O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, one_indices) # Fill those indices with '3' on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:**  `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **Fill with '3':** `fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, one_indices)` creates a blank canvas and fills the identified indices with '3'.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_row(row):
    return tuple(3 if c == 1 else c for c in row) # Recolor within each row
  O = tuple(map(recolor_row, I)) # Apply to each row
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recolor rows:** `recolor_row` function recolors cells within a single row.
2. **Apply to grid:** `map(recolor_row, I)` applies the `recolor_row` function to each row of the input grid.
