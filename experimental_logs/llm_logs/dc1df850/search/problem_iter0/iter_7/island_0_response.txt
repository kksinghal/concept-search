## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects and extending their borders by one cell to the right and upwards. 

**Input_0:**
* The object '2' has its border extended upwards and to the right by one cell.
* The object '6' remains unchanged as it touches the bottom border.

**Input_1:**
* The objects '2', '3', and '8' have their borders extended upwards and to the right.
* Notice that the extended border stops at the edge of other objects or the grid boundary.

**Input_2:**
* Similar to the above, the object '2' has its border extended, but it stops at the existing borders of the grid.


## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create a canvas of background color
  for n in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}: # Iterate over non-background colors
    indices = ofcolor(I, n) # Get indices of the current color
    extended_border = mapply(lambda idx: dneighbors(idx) | {(idx[0] - 1, idx[1] + 1)}, indices) # Calculate extended border indices
    O = underfill(O, ONE, extended_border) # Fill the extended border with '1' on the canvas
    O = paint(O, recolor(n, indices)) # Paint the original object on the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A canvas filled with the background color and the same dimensions as the input grid is created.
2. **Object Iteration:** The code iterates through each unique non-background color in the input grid.
3. **Border Extension:** For each object, the indices of its extended border (one cell up and right) are calculated.
4. **Border Filling:** The extended border is filled with '1' on the canvas, but only where the background color exists.
5. **Object Painting:** The original object with its original color is painted onto the canvas, ensuring it overlaps the extended border.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I # Initialize output with the input
  for dx, dy in (UP, RIGHT, UP_RIGHT): # Iterate over directions for border extension
    shifted_indices = mapply(lambda idx: shift(idx, (dx, dy)), asindices(I)) # Calculate shifted indices
    O = cellwise(O, fill(O, ONE, shifted_indices), O) # Fill shifted cells with '1', restore original if both match
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid is initialized with a copy of the input grid.
2. **Directional Iteration:** The code iterates through three directions: up, right, and diagonally up-right.
3. **Index Shifting & Filling:** For each direction, the indices are shifted. The shifted positions are filled with '1' on the output grid. If both the original and shifted cells have the same value, the original value is restored, effectively extending the object's border. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create background canvas
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True): # Iterate through objects
        border = outbox(toindices(obj)) # Find the outer box of the object
        border_filtered = sfilter(border, lambda idx: 0 <= idx[0] < len(I) and 0 <= idx[1] < len(I[0])) # Filter invalid indices
        O = underfill(O, ONE, border_filtered) # Fill the filtered border with '1' on the canvas
        O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the object on the canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background Canvas:** A canvas is initialized with the background color and input grid's dimensions.
2. **Object Processing:** The code identifies and iterates through each non-background object in the grid.
3. **Outer Box Calculation:**  The outer box indices surrounding each object are determined.
4. **Index Validation:** Invalid indices exceeding the grid's boundaries are filtered out.
5. **Border Filling:** The valid outer box indices are filled with '1' on the canvas, respecting the background.
6. **Object Painting:**  Finally, each object is painted onto the canvas, ensuring it sits on top of the extended border.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for i, j in asindices(I): # Iterate through all grid cells
    for di, dj in (UP, RIGHT): # Iterate through up and right directions
      ni, nj = i + di, j + dj # Calculate neighbor indices
      if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == mostcommon(I): # Check if neighbor is within bounds and background
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(ni, nj)}) # Fill the neighbor cell with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output is initialized with the input grid.
2. **Cell Iteration:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid.
3. **Neighbor Check:** For each cell, its upper and right neighbors are checked.
4. **Background Condition & Filling:** If the neighbor is within the grid bounds and has the background color, it is filled with '1'. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I) # Identify background color
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I)) # Create a canvas of background color
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != bg: # If the cell is not background
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))}) # Paint the cell onto the canvas
        if i > 0 and O[i-1][j] == bg: # Check and fill upper neighbor
          O = fill(O, ONE, {(i-1, j)})
        if j < len(row) - 1 and O[i][j+1] == bg: # Check and fill right neighbor
          O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j+1)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background Identification & Canvas:**  The background color is determined, and a canvas filled with it is created.
2. **Cell-by-Cell Processing:** The code iterates through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Non-background Handling:** If a cell doesn't contain the background color:
    * It is painted onto the canvas.
    * Its upper neighbor is checked, and if it's background, it's filled with '1'.
    * Its right neighbor is checked, and if it's background, it's filled with '1'. 
4. **Output:** The canvas with the modified cells is returned as the output.


These five versions offer different approaches to the same task, demonstrating diverse DSL function combinations and logical structures. Each version effectively generates the desired output grids for the given input examples.
