## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects with the value '2' and then expanding them outwards by one cell in all directions, filling those new cells with the value '1'.  The original '2' objects remain unchanged.

**Input 0:**
- The '2' at (0,0) expands to fill (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1) with '1'.
- The '2' at (1,3) expands to fill (0,3), (1,2), (1,4), and (2,3) with '1'. 

**Input 1:**
- The '2' at (0,7) expands similarly, filling cells to its left, right, and below with '1'.
- The '2' at (6,2) expands to fill cells above, below, and to its right with '1'.

**Input 2:**
- The '2' at (1,1) expands to fill cells above, below, and to its sides with '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_obj(obj):
    return toobject(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), I) - obj

  twos = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), TWO)
  fill_indices = merge(mapply(lambda obj: toindices(expand_obj(obj)), twos))
  O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`expand_obj(obj)`:** This function takes an object and returns a new object representing the cells directly adjacent to it.
2. **`twos = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), TWO)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid composed solely of the value '2'.
3. **`fill_indices = ...`:** This line first maps the `expand_obj` function to each '2' object, converting the resulting objects into sets of indices. It then merges these index sets.
4. **`O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)`:** Finally, the grid is modified by filling the identified indices with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_indices(indices):
    return merge(apply(dneighbors, indices)) - indices

  twos_indices =  merge(mapply(toindices, colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), TWO)))
  fill_indices = expand_indices(twos_indices)
  O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`expand_indices(indices)`:** Expands a set of indices by including their direct neighbors.
2. **`twos_indices = ...`:**  Similar to version 1, this line identifies indices belonging to '2' objects.
3. **`fill_indices = expand_indices(twos_indices)`:** Applies the expansion directly to the collected indices.
4. **`O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)`:**  Fills the expanded indices with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def halo_indices(obj):
    return toindices(toobject(backdrop(obj), I)) - toindices(obj)
    
  twos = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), TWO)
  fill_indices = merge(mapply(halo_indices, twos))
  O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`halo_indices(obj)`:** This function calculates the "halo" around an object â€“ the cells within its bounding box that are not part of the object itself.
2. **`twos = ...`:**  Identifies '2' objects as before.
3. **`fill_indices = ...`:** Maps the `halo_indices` function to each '2' object, collecting the resulting indices.
4. **`O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)`:**  Fills the halo indices with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_around(obj):
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    return frozenset((center_i + di, center_j + dj) 
                   for di in range(-1, 2) 
                   for dj in range(-1, 2)) - toindices(obj)

  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, TWO)
  fill_indices = merge(mapply(fill_around, twos))
  O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`fill_around(obj)`:** This function directly calculates the indices surrounding an object's center of mass, excluding the object itself.
2. **`objs = ...`, `twos = ...`:**  Object and '2' object identification.
3. **`fill_indices = ...`:**  Applies `fill_around` to each '2' object, merging the resulting indices.
4. **`O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)`:**  The final fill operation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def one_out(i, j):
    return frozenset({(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)}) & asindices(I)

  twos_indices = merge(mapply(toindices, colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), TWO)))
  fill_indices = merge(prapply(one_out, *zip(*twos_indices)))
  O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`one_out(i, j)`:** Given an index, this function returns the set of valid neighboring indices within the grid.
2. **`twos_indices = ...`:**  Collects indices of '2' objects.
3. **`fill_indices = ...`:** Applies `one_out` to each index within the '2' objects, gathering valid surrounding indices. 
4. **`O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)`:**  The standard fill operation using the collected indices.

Each of these versions utilizes different combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same outcome. This demonstrates the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL, even with a limited set of functions.
