## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The program should identify the object containing '2' and create a new object with value '1' surrounding it. This new object should be within the bounding box of the original object, leaving a single-cell gap on all sides.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, the program should identify the objects containing '2' and '8' and create surrounding objects with value '1'. Again, these new objects should be within the bounding boxes of the original objects, leaving a single-cell gap.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The program should create a new object with value '1' surrounding the object containing '2'. This surrounding object should extend to the leftmost and topmost boundaries of the grid.

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    surrounding = difference(box(obj), toindices(obj))
    new_objs.add(recolor(ONE, surrounding))
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify all objects in the input grid excluding the background using `objects(I, False, False, True)`.
2. **Create Surrounding Object:** For each object, we calculate the bounding box using `box(obj)`, subtract the object's indices using `difference` to get the surrounding cells, and recolor them to '1' using `recolor(ONE, surrounding)`.
3. **Paint Surrounding Objects:** We create a canvas with the background color and paint all the surrounding objects onto it using `paint`.

**Program Version 2**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (ONE, ONE))
    surrounding = difference(backdrop(shifted_obj), toindices(shifted_obj))
    new_objs.add(recolor(ONE, surrounding))
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Grid:** We partition the grid based on color, excluding the background, using `fgpartition(I)`.
2. **Shift and Find Surrounding:** For each object, we shift it one cell down and right using `shift(obj, (ONE, ONE))` and calculate the surrounding cells within its bounding box using `difference(backdrop(shifted_obj), toindices(shifted_obj))`.
3. **Paint as Before:** We recolor the surrounding cells and paint them onto a background canvas.

**Program Version 3**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  result = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
        new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= new_i < height(I) and 0 <= new_j < width(I) and (new_i, new_j) not in toindices(obj):
          result = fill(result, ONE, {(new_i, new_j)})
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:**  The program iterates through each object (excluding background).
2. **Check Adjacent Cells:**  For each cell within an object, it checks its four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
3. **Fill with '1':** If an adjacent cell is within the grid boundaries and does not belong to the current object, it is filled with '1'.

**Program Version 4**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  result = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != bg:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
          new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= new_i < height(I) and 0 <= new_j < width(I) and I[new_i][new_j] == bg:
            result = fill(result, ONE, {(new_i, new_j)})
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:**  The program iterates through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check for Non-Background Colors:** If a cell's value is not the background color, it checks its adjacent cells.
3. **Fill Adjacent Background Cells:**  If an adjacent cell is within the grid boundaries and has the background color, it's filled with '1'.

**Program Version 5**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  inverted = replace(I, mostcolor(I), ONE)
  inverted = replace(inverted, ONE, ZERO)
  objs = objects(inverted, False, False, True)
  result = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    result = underpaint(result, recolor(ONE, obj))
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Invert Colors:** Inverts the grid colors, making the background '1' and other colors '0'.
2. **Identify Objects:** Identifies objects in the inverted grid, which are now represented by '0'.
3. **Paint Surrounding Area:**  Paints the cells of each object with '1' on a blank canvas, effectively outlining the original objects.

These are just five examples, and many other variations are possible. The key is to break down the transformation into smaller, manageable steps that can be expressed using the DSL functions.
