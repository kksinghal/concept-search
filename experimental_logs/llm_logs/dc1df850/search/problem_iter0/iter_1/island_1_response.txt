## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and extending them outward by one layer, filling the new layer with the digit '1'. 

**Input 0:**
* The '2' object is extended rightward and downward by one cell.

**Input 1:**
* The '2' object is extended leftward, downward, and rightward by one cell.
* The '8' object is extended upward by one cell.

**Input 2:**
* The '2' object is extended leftward, upward, and rightward by one cell. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)  # Get all objects
  extensions = [(i + di, j + dj) for obj in objs for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)] for i, j in toindices(obj) if (i + di, j + dj) not in toindices(obj) and 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0])]
  O = fill(I, 1, frozenset(extensions))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** We first identify all objects in the input grid using the `objects` function with `univalued=False` (as objects can have different digit values), `diagonal=False` (considering only directly adjacent cells), and `without_bg=True` (excluding the background).
2. **Find extension cells:** For each object, we iterate over its cells and their four neighboring directions (`(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, `(0,-1)`, `(-1,0)`). If a neighbor is within the grid bounds and doesn't belong to the object, we mark it as an extension cell.
3. **Fill extensions:** Finally, we fill all identified extension cells with the digit '1' using the `fill` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    surrounding = mapply(neighbors, toindices(obj))
    extension = difference(surrounding, toindices(obj))
    O = fill(O, 1, extension)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through objects:** This version iterates directly through each object found in the input grid.
2. **Find surrounding cells:** For each object, it finds all neighboring cells using the `neighbors` function and the `mapply` function to apply it to all indices of the object.
3. **Determine extension:** It calculates the difference between the surrounding cells and the object's cells to get the extension area.
4. **Fill and update:** It fills the extension area with '1' and updates the output grid iteratively for each object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    shifted_objs = (shift(obj, d) for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])
    extension =  difference(merge(shifted_objs), obj)
    return fill(I, 1, extension)
  return last(rapply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Define Helper Function:** This version defines a helper function `extend_object` that takes an object as input and returns the grid with the object extended.
2. **Shift and Find Extension:** Inside the helper, it shifts the object in all four directions and finds the difference between the union of shifted objects and the original to get the extension.
3. **Apply to Each Object:** It then applies `extend_object` to each object in the input grid using `rapply`.
4. **Return Final Grid:** Finally, it returns the last grid from the list of grids generated by extending each object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]:
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == mostcommon(I):
            O = fill(O, 1, {(ni, nj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Cells:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for Non-Background:** If a cell doesn't contain the background color (most common color), it checks its neighbors.
3. **Fill Neighboring Background:** If a neighbor is a background cell, it fills that neighbor with '1'. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def extend_cell(i, j):
        if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
            return frozenset({(i + di, j + dj) for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)] if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) and I[i + di][j + dj] == mostcommon(I)})
        return frozenset()
    extensions = mpapply(extend_cell, *pair(astuple(*shape(I))))
    return fill(I, 1, extensions)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Define Helper Function:** Define a helper function `extend_cell` that takes a cell's coordinates and returns neighboring background cells to extend.
2. **Apply to All Cells:** Apply this function to all cell coordinates in the grid using `mpapply`.
3. **Fill Extensions:**  Fill all identified extension cells with '1'.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
