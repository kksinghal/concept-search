## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and extending them horizontally and vertically by one cell, filling the new cells with the digit '1'. The original object's shape and position are preserved.

**Input_0:**

- The '2' object at (0,0) expands right and down, creating a rectangle of '1's. 
- The '6' object at (3,1) remains unchanged as it doesn't have space to expand.

**Input_1:**

- The '2' object at (0,7) expands left and down, creating a column of '1's.
- The '3' object at (2,3) remains unchanged.
- The '8' object at (4,6) remains unchanged.

**Input_2:**

- The '2' object at (1,1) expands in all directions, creating a diamond shape of '1's around it.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  new_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    for value, (i, j) in obj:
      for direction in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]:
        new_i, new_j = add((i,j), direction)
        if 0 <= new_i < height(I) and 0 <= new_j < width(I):
          if index(new_grid, (new_i, new_j)) == mostcolor(I):
            new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(new_i, new_j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through objects and cells:** The program iterates through each object and then each cell within the object.
3. **Expand each cell:** For each cell, it checks locations one step in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
4. **Conditional fill:** If the neighboring location is within the grid bounds and contains the background color, it's filled with '1'.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(fill(I, 1, mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc), asindices(I))), asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get all indices:** `asindices(I)` gets all cell indices of the input grid.
2. **Get neighboring indices:** `mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc), asindices(I))` finds the directly neighboring indices for each cell and merges them into a single set.
3. **Fill with '1':** `fill(I, 1, ...)` fills the grid `I` with '1's at the previously identified neighboring indices.
4. **Paint original objects:** `paint(..., asobject(I))` paints the original objects from the input grid onto the modified grid, ensuring their preservation. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    return cellwise(canvas(1, shape(I)), I, mostcolor(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create canvas of '1's:** `canvas(1, shape(I))` creates a new grid of the same size as the input, filled entirely with '1's.
2. **Cellwise comparison:** `cellwise(..., I, mostcolor(I))` compares the canvas with the input grid cell by cell.
3. **Conditional replacement:** If the cells match, the '1' from the canvas is kept. Otherwise, the cell is filled with the background color of the input grid. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  new_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    new_grid = paint(fill(new_grid, 1, delta(toindices(obj))), obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(...)` function identifies individual objects within the input grid.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Find Delta:** For each object, `delta(toindices(obj))` identifies the cells surrounding the object within its bounding box.
4. **Fill and Paint:**  The `fill` function fills the delta cells with '1's. Then, the `paint` function overlays the original object back onto the grid, ensuring it's not overwritten by the '1's. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_grids = [
    shift(asobject(I), direction) for direction in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]
  ]
  new_grid = I
  for shifted_grid in shifted_grids:
    new_grid = underpaint(new_grid, shifted_grid)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create shifted objects:** The code creates four copies of the input grid, each shifted one cell in a different direction (up, down, left, right) using `shift(asobject(I), direction)`. 
2. **Iterate and underpaint:** It iterates through these shifted grids and uses `underpaint(new_grid, shifted_grid)` to paint the shifted objects onto the `new_grid` only where the background color exists. This effectively expands the objects by one cell in all directions.


These five versions showcase distinct logic and function combinations to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
