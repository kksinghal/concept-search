## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves identifying the bounding box encompassing all non-zero digits. The area within this bounding box is then filled with the digit '1', except for the cells originally occupied by non-zero digits, which retain their original values.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, a bounding box encompassing all non-zero digits is identified.  However, this time, the filling pattern changes. Instead of filling the entire box, only the cells directly bordering the non-zero digits are filled with '1'. The non-zero digits retain their original values.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The pattern continues, with the bounding box of non-zero digits being identified. This time, the filling is more selective.  Only the top and left borders of the bounding box are filled with the digit '1'. The cell directly above the top-left corner of the bounding box is left empty (original value '0'). 

## Code Generation:

**Note:** Since the original two programs are not provided, the following code versions utilize functions from the `dsl.py` file and draw inspiration from the provided examples and analysis.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    non_zeros = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO))
    bounding_box = backdrop(non_zeros)
    O = fill(I, ONE, difference(bounding_box, non_zeros))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`non_zeros = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO))`**:  Identifies the indices of all non-zero cells in the input grid `I`.
2. **`bounding_box = backdrop(non_zeros)`**: Determines the indices forming the bounding box around the `non_zeros` indices.
3. **`O = fill(I, ONE, difference(bounding_box, non_zeros))`**: Fills the input grid `I` with '1' at the indices that are part of the `bounding_box` but not part of the original `non_zeros` indices.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T) 
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        border = difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))
        O = underfill(O, ONE, border)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`**:  Extracts all objects (connected components of non-zero digits) from the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objs:`**:  Iterates through each extracted object.
3. **`border = difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))`**: Calculates the bordering cells around the current object.
4. **`O = underfill(O, ONE, border)`**: Fills the bordering cells with '1' only if they originally contain the background color (most common color) in the grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    nz = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO))
    ul = ulcorner(nz)
    lr = lrcorner(nz)
    O = fill(I, ONE, connect(ul, (lr[0], ul[1])))
    O = fill(O, ONE, connect(ul, (ul[0], lr[1])))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`nz = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO))`**: Identifies indices of non-zero cells.
2. **`ul = ulcorner(nz)`**: Gets the index of the upper-left corner of the non-zero area.
3. **`lr = lrcorner(nz)`**: Gets the index of the lower-right corner of the non-zero area.
4. **`O = fill(I, ONE, connect(ul, (lr[0], ul[1])))`**: Fills the top border of the bounding box with '1'.
5. **`O = fill(O, ONE, connect(ul, (ul[0], lr[1])))`**: Fills the left border of the bounding box with '1'.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def solve(I):
    mask = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    nz = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO))
    for idx in nz:
        mask = fill(mask, ONE, neighbors(idx)) 
    O = cellwise(I, mask, ONE)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mask = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.
2. **`nz = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO))`**:  Gets indices of non-zero cells.
3. **`for idx in nz:`**: Iterates through non-zero indices.
4. **`mask = fill(mask, ONE, neighbors(idx))`**: Marks the neighbors of each non-zero cell with '1' on the `mask`.
5. **`O = cellwise(I, mask, ONE)`**: Combines the input and mask, keeping the input value if it's non-zero, otherwise using '1' from the mask.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    box = outbox(difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO)))
    O = underfill(I, ONE, box)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`box = outbox(difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO)))`**:  Computes the indices of the outbox surrounding the non-zero elements.
2. **`O = underfill(I, ONE, box)`**:  Fills the cells within the computed `box` with '1' if they were originally the background color in the input grid.
