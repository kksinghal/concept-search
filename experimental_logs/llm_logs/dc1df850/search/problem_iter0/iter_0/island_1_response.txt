## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

The transformation involves identifying the object formed by the digit '2' and extending it diagonally upwards and to the right, filling the newly added cells with the digit '1'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation focuses on the object formed by the digit '2' located at the bottom left corner of the grid.  It extends this object upwards and to the right by one cell, filling the new cells with the digit '1'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

The transformation targets the object formed by the digit '2'. It creates a bounding box around this object and fills all cells within the box with the digit '1', except for the cells originally occupied by the '2' object.

## Program_to_be_generated:


Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation, each with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      ul = ulcorner(obj)
      O = fill(I, 1, {(ul[0] - i, ul[1] + i) for i in range(1, min(height(obj), width(obj)))})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Identifies all objects on the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each detected object.
3. **`if color(obj) == 2:`:**  Focuses on objects formed by the digit '2'.
4. **`ul = ulcorner(obj)`:**  Finds the upper-left corner of the '2' object.
5. **`O = fill(I, 1, {(ul[0] - i, ul[1] + i) for i in range(1, min(height(obj), width(obj)))}):`:**  Fills a diagonal line starting from the cell above the upper-left corner of the '2' object, extending upwards and rightwards, with the digit '1'. The length of the line is determined by the smaller dimension of the object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  two_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  corner = ulcorner(two_obj)
  direction = (-1, 1)
  line = shoot(corner, direction)
  O = underfill(I, 1, line) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`two_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)`:** Extracts the object formed by the digit '2'.
2. **`corner = ulcorner(two_obj)`:**  Gets the upper-left corner of the '2' object.
3. **`direction = (-1, 1)`:**  Defines the diagonal direction (up-right).
4. **`line = shoot(corner, direction)`:** Creates a diagonal line extending from the corner in the defined direction.
5. **`O = underfill(I, 1, line)`:** Fills the background cells along the created diagonal line with the digit '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj_two = argmax(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and lrcorner(obj)[0] == len(I) - 1)
  O = fill(I, 1,  {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj_two) if index(I, (i - 1, j + 1)) == 0})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_two = argmax(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and lrcorner(obj)[0] == len(I) - 1)`:**  Finds the '2' object that is touching the bottom of the grid.
2. **`O = fill(I, 1,  {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj_two) if index(I, (i - 1, j + 1)) == 0})`:** Iterates through each cell of the '2' object and fills the cell to its right with '1' if the cell diagonally up-right is empty (background). 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 2)
  shifted_obj = shift(target_obj, (-1, 1))
  O = paint(I, recolor(1, intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), delta(target_obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 2)`:** Extracts the object formed by the digit '2'.
2. **`shifted_obj = shift(target_obj, (-1, 1))`:** Shifts the extracted object one cell up and one cell right.
3. **`O = paint(I, recolor(1, intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), delta(target_obj))))`:** Calculates the intersection between the shifted object's indices and the original object's delta (cells surrounding the object). This identifies the cells to be filled. Finally, it paints these cells with the digit '1' on the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 2)
  extension = {(i - 1, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if (i - 1, j + 1) not in toindices(obj) and 0 <= i - 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])}
  O = fill(I, 1, extension)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 2)`:**  Extracts the object made of the digit '2'.
2. **`extension = {(i - 1, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if (i - 1, j + 1) not in toindices(obj) and 0 <= i - 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])}`:**  Finds the cells that are diagonally up-right to each cell of the '2' object and are within the grid boundaries, but not part of the '2' object itself.
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, extension)`:** Fills the identified 'extension' cells with the digit '1'.

These programs provide diverse solutions using different approaches within the DSL to achieve the required transformations.
