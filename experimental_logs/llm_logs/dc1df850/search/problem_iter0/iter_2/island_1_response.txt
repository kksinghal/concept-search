## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation can be described as follows:

**For each object:**

1. **Identify Background:** Determine the most frequent color in the grid, assuming this is the background.
2. **Extend Right and Down:**  Extend the object by filling in background cells that are directly to the right and below object cells. 

**Let's analyze this with the given input-output examples:**

* **Input 0:** The '2' object is extended downwards, and the single cell extension rightwards merges with the downward extension.
* **Input 1:** The '2' object is extended rightwards and downwards, creating a 'tail' that stops before reaching other objects. 
* **Input 2:**  The '2' object is extended downwards and rightwards, encountering the grid boundary and stopping. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    shifted_down = shift(obj, DOWN)
    shifted_right = shift(obj, RIGHT)
    extension = difference(combine(shifted_down, shifted_right), obj)
    return fill(I, 1, toindices(extension))
  return last(rapply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_object(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input and returns a modified grid.
    * It calculates `shifted_down` and `shifted_right` objects.
    * `extension`: Calculates the difference between the combined shifted objects and the original object, identifying the extension area.
    * `fill`: It fills the extension area with the value '1' on the original grid 'I'.
2. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`rapply(extend_object, ...)`:** Applies the `extend_object` function to each object found in the grid.
4. **`last(...)`:** Returns the last modified grid from the `rapply` output, which represents the final transformed grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right_down(grid, obj):
      return paint(grid,  {(1, (i + di, j + dj)) for v, (i, j) in obj 
                           for di, dj in [(1, 0), (0, 1)] 
                           if 0 <= i + di < len(grid) and 0 <= j + dj < len(grid[0]) and grid[i + di][j + dj] == mostcommon(grid)})
  return last(rapply(rbind(extend_right_down, I), objects(I, False, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_right_down(grid, obj)`:** This function takes the grid and an object as input.
    * It directly paints '1' onto the grid at locations that are one step down or one step right of each cell in the object, only if the target location is background.
2. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Extracts objects from the grid, excluding the background.
3. **`rbind(extend_right_down, I)`:**  Creates a partially applied function where `grid` is fixed as 'I' for `extend_right_down`.
4. **`rapply(..., ...)`:** Applies the partially applied `extend_right_down` function to each object.
5. **`last(...)`:** Returns the last modified grid from the `rapply` output.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def should_extend(i, j):
    return 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]) and I[i][j] == mostcommon(I) and ((i > 0 and I[i-1][j] != mostcommon(I)) or (j > 0 and I[i][j-1] != mostcommon(I)))
  extension = {(1, (i, j)) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if should_extend(i, j)}
  return paint(I, extension)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`should_extend(i, j)`:** This function checks if a cell at (i, j) should be part of the extension.
    * It checks if the cell is within the grid boundaries.
    * It verifies if the cell is a background color.
    * It ensures that the cell is either below or to the right of a non-background cell.
2. **`extension`:** Creates a set of cells that should be filled with '1' based on `should_extend`. 
3. **`paint(I, extension)`:** Paints the `extension` onto the original grid 'I' with value '1'. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def extend_object(obj):
        return combine(obj, frozenset({(1, (i + 1, j)), (1, (i, j + 1))} for v, (i, j) in obj 
                              if 0 <= i + 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) 
                              and I[i+1][j] == mostcommon(I) and I[i][j+1] == mostcommon(I)))
    return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True))))
```
**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_object(obj)`:** Takes an object and returns the object combined with its right and down extension cells if those are background.
2. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Extracts objects from the grid, excluding the background.
3. **`apply(extend_object, ...)`:** Applies `extend_object` to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all the extended objects into one set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged set of extended objects onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def right_down_indices(i, j):
        return {(i + 1, j), (i, j + 1)}
    extended_indices = mpapply(right_down_indices, *pair(*map(totuple, map(compose(frozenset,apply(lambda x: x[1],totuple)), objects(I, False, False, True)))))
    return fill(I, 1, frozenset((i, j) for i, j in extended_indices if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]) and I[i][j] == mostcommon(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_down_indices(i, j)`:** Returns a set containing indices one step right and one step down from the input index.
2. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Extracts non-background objects from the grid.
3. The nested `map` and `compose` functions extract the indices of each object cell.
4. **`mpapply(right_down_indices, ...)`:** Applies `right_down_indices` to all object cell indices, generating a set of potential extension indices.
5. **`fill(I, 1, ...)`:** Fills the potential extension indices with '1' only if they are within the grid boundaries and are background cells.

Each of these program versions utilizes different DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation, demonstrating distinct logical approaches to solve the problem.
