## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation fills the grid with the value `1` based on these rules:

* **Input_0:**  Fills a 1-cell border around all non-background objects, except for the bottom border.
* **Input_1:** Fills a 1-cell border around all non-background objects, except for the top and right borders.
* **Input_2:** Fills a 1-cell border around all non-background objects, except for the bottom and right borders.

Essentially, the transformation creates a partial border around each object, excluding specific border sides depending on the input.

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_2dee498d(I):
  O = I
  for n in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:
    indices = ofcolor(I, n)
    shifted_down = shift(indices, DOWN)
    shifted_left = shift(indices, LEFT)
    combined_indices = indices | shifted_down | shifted_left
    O = underfill(O, ONE, backdrop(combined_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Non-Background Colors:** Loops through each unique color (`n`) in the input grid (`I`) excluding the background color (most common).
2. **Find Object Indices:**  Gets the indices of all cells with the current color (`n`).
3. **Shift Indices:** Creates two new sets of indices by shifting the original indices one cell down and one cell left respectively.
4. **Combine Indices:** Merges the original indices with the shifted indices.
5. **Fill Border:**  Fills the background cells within the bounding box of the combined indices with the value `1`. 

This version creates a partial border by strategically shifting the indices before filling.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_2dee498d(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    trimmed_obj = difference(obj, toobject(outbox(obj), I))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(ONE, trimmed_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Objects:** Loops through each non-background object in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Trim Object:** Removes the outer layer of cells from each object by finding the difference between the object and the object formed by its outbox.
3. **Paint Border:** Paints the trimmed object onto the output grid (`O`) using the value `1`. This effectively fills the desired partial border.

This version directly manipulates the objects instead of indices to achieve the transformation. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_2dee498d(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for n in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:
    indices = ofcolor(I, n)
    border = difference(backdrop(indices), indices)
    shifted_right = shift(border, RIGHT)
    shifted_up = shift(border, UP)
    combined_border = border | shifted_right | shifted_up
    O = fill(O, ONE, combined_border)
    O = paint(O, recolor(n, indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Initializes an output grid (`O`) filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate over Colors:** Loops through each unique non-background color (`n`) in the input grid (`I`).
3. **Calculate Border:** Identifies the border indices around each object by subtracting the object indices from its bounding box.
4. **Shift and Combine Border:** Shifts the border indices one cell right and one cell up and combines them.
5. **Fill Border:** Fills the shifted and combined border indices on the output grid with the value `1`.
6. **Paint Object:**  Paints the original object onto the output grid using its original color (`n`).

This version explicitly calculates the border indices and manipulates them before filling.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_2dee498d(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = underfill(O, ONE,  difference(outbox(obj), shift(outbox(obj), (-1, -1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Objects:**  Loops through each non-background object in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Border:** Calculates the partial border by finding the difference between the object's outbox and a shifted version of the outbox (shifted one cell up and left).
3. **Fill Border:**  Fills the calculated border indices with the value `1` on the output grid.

This version leverages set operations on outboxes to directly determine the border indices.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_2dee498d(I):
  O = I
  for n in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
      if color(obj) == n:
        for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
          O = underfill(O, ONE, {(i+1, j), (i, j+1), (i-1, j), (i, j-1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Colors and Objects:**  Loops through each unique non-background color and then each object in the grid.
2. **Match Color:** Checks if the current object's color matches the iterated color.
3. **Fill Border:** For each cell in the matched object, fills its four neighboring cells with the value `1` on the output grid.

This version iterates through individual cells of each object to fill the surrounding border.
