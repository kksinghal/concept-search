## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to involve these steps:

1. **Identify Non-Zero Cells:** Find all cells in the input grid that don't have a value of 0.
2. **Create a Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangle that encloses all the non-zero cells.
3. **Fill with 1s:** Fill all cells within the bounding box with the value 1.
4. **Preserve Original Non-Zero Values:**  Overwrite the 1s with the original values from the input grid for cells that were initially non-zero.

**Input 0:**

- Non-zero cells are at: (0,0), (1,3), (3,1). 
- Bounding box encompasses the top 4x4 area.
- This area is filled with 1s, then the original 2 and 6 are placed back.

**Input 1:**

- Similar logic, but the bounding box extends to the rightmost '2'.

**Input 2:**

- The bounding box is tighter in this case, only encompassing a 3x3 area.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_2bee17df(I):
  # Find indices of non-zero cells
  nz = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO))
  # Fill bounding box with 1s
  box_filled = fill(I, ONE, box(nz)) 
  # Overwrite with original non-zero values
  O = cellwise(I, box_filled, ONE) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `nz = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO))`: Identifies the indices of all non-zero cells by taking the difference between all indices and indices of zero-valued cells.
2. `box_filled = fill(I, ONE, box(nz))`: Creates a new grid (`box_filled`) where the bounding box of non-zero cells is filled with 1s.
3. `O = cellwise(I, box_filled, ONE)`:  Compares the original grid (`I`) with `box_filled`. If the cell in `box_filled` is 1, it keeps the value from the original grid (`I`), otherwise, it uses the value 1.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_2bee17df(I):
  # Object representing all non-zero cells
  nz_obj = toobject(difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO)), I)
  # Paint the object onto a canvas of 1s
  O = paint(fill(I, ONE, box(nz_obj)), nz_obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `nz_obj = toobject(difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO)), I)`:  Similar to version 1, but creates an object representing all non-zero cells with their values.
2. `O = paint(fill(I, ONE, box(nz_obj)), nz_obj)`:  Creates a canvas filled with 1s using the bounding box of the `nz_obj`. Then it paints the `nz_obj` onto this canvas, effectively overwriting the 1s with the original non-zero values.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_2bee17df(I):
  # Lambda function to check for non-zero values
  is_not_zero = lambda x: x != ZERO 
  # Apply the lambda function to each cell and fill bounding box
  O = fill(I, ONE, box(mfilter(asindices(I), is_not_zero)))
  # Overwrite with original values using cellwise comparison
  O = cellwise(I, O, ONE)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `is_not_zero = lambda x: x != ZERO`: Defines a lambda function to check if a cell value is not zero.
2. `O = fill(I, ONE, box(mfilter(asindices(I), is_not_zero)))`: Applies `is_not_zero` to filter all grid indices, keeping only non-zero ones. Then fills the bounding box of these indices with 1s. 
3. `O = cellwise(I, O, ONE)`: Similar to previous versions, uses `cellwise` for final value assignment.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_2bee17df(I):
  # Find non-zero indices and create object
  nz_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO))
  nz_obj = toobject(nz_indices, I) 
  # Create a grid of 1s with the same dimensions as input
  ones_grid = canvas(ONE, shape(I)) 
  # Combine the ones_grid and nz_obj, prioritizing nz_obj values
  O = cellwise(paint(ones_grid, nz_obj), ones_grid, ONE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `nz_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO))`:  Identifies non-zero indices.
2. `nz_obj = toobject(nz_indices, I)`: Creates an object from the non-zero indices and their corresponding values.
3. `ones_grid = canvas(ONE, shape(I))`: Creates a grid filled with 1s, having the same dimensions as the input.
4. `O = cellwise(paint(ones_grid, nz_obj), ones_grid, ONE)`:  Paints `nz_obj` onto `ones_grid`. Then `cellwise` is used to prioritize values from the painted grid, ensuring original non-zero values are preserved.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_2bee17df(I):
  # Directly create an object representing the desired output
  O = frozenset({(ONE, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(nz), lowermost(nz) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(nz), rightmost(nz) + 1)})
  # Combine with the original non-zero values
  O = O | toobject(difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO)), I)
  # Paint the final object onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `O = frozenset({(ONE, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(nz), lowermost(nz) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(nz), rightmost(nz) + 1)})`: Directly constructs an object representing the bounding box filled with 1s, leveraging the `uppermost`, `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost` functions to determine the box's boundaries.
2. `O = O | toobject(difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO)), I)`: Combines the bounding box object with the object representing the original non-zero cells using set union.
3. `O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), O)`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the final object onto it.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation.  Each version leverages different combinations of DSL functions and logical structures, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
