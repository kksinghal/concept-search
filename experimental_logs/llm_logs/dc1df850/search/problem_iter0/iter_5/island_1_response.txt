## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying non-background objects and extending them diagonally down and to the right. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** 
* The '2' object is extended diagonally down and right, filling the cells with '1's.
* The '6' object remains unchanged.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
* The '2' object is extended diagonally down and right with '1's.
* The '3' object remains unchanged.
* The '8' object has a diagonal line of '1's extending from its lower left corner.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
* The '2' object is extended diagonally down and right with '1's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def extend_diagonal(I):
  def extend_down_right(indices):
    return frozenset({(i + d[0], j + d[1]) for i, j in indices for d in {DOWN, RIGHT} 
                      if 0 <= i + d[0] < len(I) and 0 <= j + d[1] < len(I[0])})
  extended_indices = mfilter(objects(I, False, False, True), extend_down_right)
  return fill(I, 1, extended_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_down_right(indices)`:** This inner function takes a set of indices and returns a new set containing the original indices and their down-right neighbors, if they exist within the grid boundaries. 
2. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:** This identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
3. **`mfilter(... , extend_down_right)`:** This applies the `extend_down_right` function to each object's indices and merges the results into a single set of extended indices.
4. **`fill(I, 1, extended_indices)`:** This fills the input grid `I` with '1's at the extended indices, effectively extending the objects diagonally down and right. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def extend_diagonal_v2(I):
  def is_foreground(obj):
    return any(I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) for i, j in toindices(obj))
  def extend_obj(obj):
    return {(1, (i + 1, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= i + 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])}
  extended_objects = frozenset({cell for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) 
                             if is_foreground(obj)
                             for cell in extend_obj(obj)})
  return paint(I, extended_objects)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_foreground(obj)`:**  Checks if an object is not the background by comparing its cell values to the most common value (background) in the grid.
2. **`extend_obj(obj)`:**  Extends each object by adding a cell with value '1' diagonally down-right to each of its cells within grid boundaries.
3. **`objects(...)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
4. The code iterates through each identified object. If the object is not a background object, it extends it using `extend_obj` and adds the extended cells to `extended_objects`.
5. **`paint(I, extended_objects)`:**  Paints the extended cells onto the input grid `I`, creating the final output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def extend_diagonal_v3(I):
  extended_indices = frozenset()
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if 0 <= i + 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]):
        extended_indices = insert((i + 1, j + 1), extended_indices)
  return fill(I, 1, extended_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extended_indices = frozenset()`:** Initializes an empty set to store indices for extension.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):`**: Iterates through each non-background object.
3. **`for i, j in toindices(obj):`**:  Iterates through each cell index in the object.
4. **`if 0 <= i + 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]):`**:  Checks if the down-right neighbor of the cell is within the grid boundaries. 
5. **`extended_indices = insert((i + 1, j + 1), extended_indices)`:** If within boundaries, add the down-right neighbor's index to the `extended_indices` set.
6. **`return fill(I, 1, extended_indices)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with '1's at all the identified `extended_indices`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def extend_diagonal_v4(I):
  def diagonal_shift(obj):
    return shift(obj, (1, 1))
  shifted_objects = mapply(diagonal_shift, objects(I, False, False, True))
  return underpaint(I, merge(shifted_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`diagonal_shift(obj)`:** This function shifts an object diagonally down and right by one unit.
2. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Identifies all non-background objects in the grid.
3. **`mapply(diagonal_shift, ...)`:** Applies the `diagonal_shift` function to all identified objects and merges the resulting shifted objects.
4. **`underpaint(I, ...)`:**  "Underpaints" the shifted objects onto the original grid `I`, meaning it only paints on cells that currently have the background color. This ensures the shifted objects only extend the original objects and don't overwrite them.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def extend_diagonal_v5(I):
  def extend_point(i, j):
    if 0 <= i + 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
      return frozenset({(1, (i + 1, j + 1))})
    return frozenset()
  extended_cells = merge(prapply(extend_point, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))))
  return paint(I, extended_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_point(i, j)`:** This function checks if a given coordinate (i, j) is a non-background cell and if its down-right neighbor is within grid boundaries. If both conditions are true, it returns a set containing a single element: the down-right neighbor with value '1'. Otherwise, it returns an empty set.
2. **`prapply(extend_point, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0])))`:**  This applies the `extend_point` function to every possible coordinate in the grid, creating a set of sets. 
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the set of sets from the previous step into a single set containing all the extended cells.
4. **`paint(I, extended_cells)`:**  Paints the extended cells onto the original grid `I`.

These five programs demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired diagonal extension transformation while using only the functions provided in the DSL. Each program leverages different function combinations and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
