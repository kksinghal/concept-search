## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The program should identify objects with the value '2'. For each of these objects, it should fill the cells in a '+' shape around the object with the value '1', but only if the cell is within the grid boundaries.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to the previous transformation, the program should locate objects with the value '2'. This time, it fills the cells directly above, below, left, and right of the object with '1', again respecting grid boundaries.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The transformation remains consistent - find objects with the value '2' and fill the surrounding cells in a '+' shape with '1', ensuring the operation stays within the grid.


## Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_cross(obj):
    return toobject(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), I) - obj

  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, TWO)
  expanded_objs = mapply(fill_cross, twos)
  fill_indices = merge(mapply(toindices, expanded_objs))
  O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_cross(obj)` Function:** This function takes an object as input and calculates its center of mass. It then identifies the direct neighbors of the center using `dneighbors` and converts them back to object form using `toobject`. Finally, it removes the original object from this set of neighbors, effectively creating a '+' shape around the object.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Extracts objects from the input grid `I` using `objects`.
   - Filters for objects with the value '2' using `colorfilter`.
   - Applies the `fill_cross` function to each '2' object using `mapply`, generating a set of expanded objects.
   - Merges the indices of all expanded objects using `merge` and `toindices`.
   - Fills the identified indices with the value '1' using `fill` to generate the output grid `O`.


## Program Version 2: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def cross_indices(obj):
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    return frozenset({(center_i - 1, center_j), (center_i + 1, center_j), (center_i, center_j - 1), (center_i, center_j + 1)})

  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, TWO)
  fill_indices = merge(mapply(cross_indices, twos)) & asindices(I)  # Intersection ensures staying within grid
  O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`cross_indices(obj)` Function:** This function directly calculates the indices of the '+' shape around the object's center of mass without converting to and from object form. 
2. **Main Program:**
   - Similar to Version 1, it extracts objects, filters for '2' objects.
   - Applies `cross_indices` to each '2' object using `mapply` to get the indices to fill.
   - Importantly, it uses `& asindices(I)` to ensure only valid indices within the grid are filled.
   - Finally, it fills the selected indices with '1' using `fill`.


## Program Version 3: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_around(obj):
    return toobject(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)) | ineighbors(centerofmass(obj)), I) - obj

  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, TWO)
  expanded_objs = mapply(fill_around, twos)
  fill_indices = merge(mapply(toindices, expanded_objs))
  O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to version 1 but uses both `dneighbors` and `ineighbors` to create a filled square instead of a '+'.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def expand_object(obj):
        return toobject(outbox(toindices(obj)), I) - obj

    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    twos = colorfilter(objs, TWO)
    expanded_objs = mapply(expand_object, twos)
    fill_indices = merge(mapply(toindices, expanded_objs))
    O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to version 3 but uses `outbox` instead of `dneighbors` and `ineighbors` to create a filled square.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def plus_shape_indices(i, j):
    return frozenset({(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)})

  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, TWO)
  fill_indices = merge(prapply(lambda i, j: plus_shape_indices(i, j) & asindices(I), *zip(*merge(mapply(toindices, twos)))))
  O = fill(I, ONE, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to version 2 but uses `prapply` instead of `mapply` and `zip` to iterate over the indices of the objects.

These five program versions utilize distinct combinations of DSL functions and logical approaches to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL constraints.
