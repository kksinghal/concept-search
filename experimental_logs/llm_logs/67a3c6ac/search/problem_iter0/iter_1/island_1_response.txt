## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves rotating the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The top row (6 6 6 2) becomes the rightmost column (2 6 6 6) when rotated counterclockwise.
* Similarly, the leftmost column becomes the top row, and so on.

**Input_1:**

* The same 90-degree counterclockwise rotation logic applies. For instance, the top-left 2x2 block (7 7, 6 7) becomes (7 6, 7 7).

**Input_2:**

*  The transformation holds true, with the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation clearly observable. For example, the diagonal 1 7 2 in the input becomes 2 7 1 in the output.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code that achieve the desired 90-degree counterclockwise rotation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise using rot270.
  """
  O = rot270(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `rot270(I)`: Directly applies the `rot270` function from the DSL to perform the counterclockwise rotation on the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise using three 90-degree clockwise rotations.
  """
  O = rot90(I)
  O = rot90(O)
  O = rot90(O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `rot90(I)`: Performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation three times consecutively, effectively achieving a 270-degree clockwise (equivalent to 90-degree counterclockwise) rotation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise by transposing and then reversing each row.
  """
  O = tuple(zip(*I))  # Transpose the grid
  O = tuple(tuple(row[::-1]) for row in O)  # Reverse each row
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `tuple(zip(*I))`: Transposes the input grid `I`, swapping rows and columns.
* `tuple(tuple(row[::-1]) for row in O)`:  Reverses each row of the transposed grid `O`, completing the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise using nested list comprehension.
  """
  O = tuple(tuple(I[j][i] for j in range(len(I)-1,-1,-1)) for i in range(len(I[0])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `tuple(tuple(I[j][i]...` Constructs the rotated grid directly using nested list comprehension. It iterates through the grid in reverse order of columns (`j`) and normal order of rows (`i`) to achieve the counterclockwise rotation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise by creating a new grid with rotated indices.
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (w, h))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], ((w - 1 - j), i)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `canvas(0, (w, h))`: Creates a new blank canvas `O` with dimensions swapped to accommodate the rotation.
* The nested loop iterates through the original grid `I` and places each value at its corresponding rotated position in the new grid `O`.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, utilizing various functions and logic from the provided DSL. Each version fulfills the requirement of being distinct and not merely a minor variation of the others.
