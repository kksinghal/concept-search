## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts each object within the grid to the left edge, aligning it with the grid's left boundary while maintaining its original shape and color. 

Let's illustrate with Input_0:

**Input_0:**

```
6 6 6 2
6 1 6 2
7 2 7 2
1 7 2 2
```

**Output_0:**

```
2 6 6 6 
2 6 1 6 
2 7 2 7
2 2 7 1
```

Notice how each object (identified by a unique digit) in the output grid is shifted to touch the left edge without changing its shape. For example, the '2' object, originally spanning columns 3 and 4 in Input_0, is now shifted to occupy columns 1 and 2 in Output_0. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects from the grid
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)  # Find leftmost column index of the object
    moved_objs = insert(shift(obj, (0, -leftmost_j)), moved_objs)  # Shift object left
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), moved_objs)  # Paint objects onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies and separates individual objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Shift:** The code iterates through each `obj` in `objs`. For each object:
    - `leftmost(obj)` finds the column index of the leftmost cell.
    - `shift(obj, (0, -leftmost_j))` shifts the object leftwards to align with the left edge (column 0).
    - `insert(...)` adds the shifted object to the `moved_objs` set.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** 
    - `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a blank canvas with the background color and same dimensions as the input grid.
    - `paint(..., moved_objs)` paints the shifted objects onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create blank canvas
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # If not background:
        obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: (i, j) in toindices(x)) # Find the object at (i, j)
        leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j - leftmost_j)})  # Fill in shifted position
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas `O`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates through every cell (i, j) of the input grid `I`.
   - If the cell is not part of the background:
     - `extract(objects(...), ...)`  finds the object containing the current cell.
     -  It calculates the shift amount (`j - leftmost_j`) and fills the corresponding cell on the canvas `O` with the original color. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, -leftmost(obj))), objs) # Shift all objects at once
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs)) # Paint shifted objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Shift:**
   - Extracts objects using `objects(...)`.
   - `apply(lambda obj: shift(...), objs)` shifts all objects leftward simultaneously using a lambda function within `apply`. 
2. **Paint:**  Similar to previous versions, it paints the shifted objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    shift_amount = -leftmost(obj)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))) # Cover and paint each object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **In-Place Modification:** This version modifies the input grid `I` directly.
2. **Iterate, Cover, and Paint:** 
   - For each object:
     -  `cover(O, obj)` removes the object from its current position on the grid.
     -  `shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))` calculates the shift and moves the object.
     -  `paint(...)` paints the shifted object back onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      O = fill(O, v, {(i, j - leftmost(obj))}) # Directly fill shifted cell on canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas and Iteration:** Creates a blank canvas `O` and iterates through each object and its cells.
2. **Direct Filling:**  For each cell within an object, it calculates the new shifted position and directly fills the corresponding cell on the canvas `O` with the correct color. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL, showcasing various function combinations and logic flows.
