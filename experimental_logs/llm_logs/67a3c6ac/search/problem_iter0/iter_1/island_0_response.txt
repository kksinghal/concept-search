## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be rotating the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. Let's analyze each input-output pair to confirm:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The top row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output (reversed).
- The second row of the input becomes the second rightmost column of the output (reversed), and so on.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Same pattern as Input_0, confirming the counterclockwise rotation.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Again, the same pattern holds, solidifying our understanding of the transformation.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, utilizing functions from the DSL and drawing inspiration from potentially similar programs (not provided in this prompt):

**Program Version 1: Using `rot270`**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return rot270(I)
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly applies the `rot270` function from the DSL, which performs a 270-degree clockwise rotation (equivalent to 90-degree counterclockwise). 

**Program Version 2:  Using `zip` and slicing**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(zip(*I[::-1])) 
```

**Explanation:**

- `zip(*I)` transposes the grid (swapping rows and columns).
- `[::-1]` reverses the order of rows in the transposed grid. 
- This combination effectively achieves a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

**Program Version 3: Iterative Approach**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  output = [[0 for _ in range(h)] for _ in range(w)]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      output[j][h - 1 - i] = I[i][j]
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in output)
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through the input grid (`I`) and constructs the output grid by placing elements in their rotated positions.

**Program Version 4: Using `dmirror` and `hmirror`**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hmirror(dmirror(I))
```

**Explanation:**

- `dmirror(I)` mirrors the grid along the main diagonal.
- `hmirror(...)` mirrors the resulting grid horizontally.
- This sequence results in a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

**Program Version 5:  Using `rot90` three times**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return rot90(rot90(rot90(I)))
```

**Explanation:**
-  Applies the `rot90` function three times to get 270-degree clockwise rotation (equivalent to 90-degree counterclockwise).
