## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the last column of the input grid and placing it at the beginning, effectively shifting all columns to the right and wrapping the last column around to the first position. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 
```

Output:
```
3 1 2 
6 4 5
9 7 8
```

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A, but avoids intermediate tuple creation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(row[i % len(row)-1] for i in range(len(row))) for row in I) 
```
**Explanation:**
- We iterate through each row of the input grid `I`.
- For each row, we create a new tuple by shifting the elements one position to the right, wrapping the last element to the beginning using modulo operation (`i % len(row)`).

**Version 2:** (Uses `rot90` and slicing for a more visual approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v for v in (r[-1:] + r[:-1])) for r in rot90(I)) 
```
**Explanation:**
- We rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise using `rot90(I)`.
- Then, for each row (which now represents a column) in the rotated grid, we take the last element (`r[-1:]`) and concatenate it with the remaining elements (`r[:-1]`).
- Finally, we convert the rows back into tuples to get the desired output.

**Version 3:** (Emphasizes column extraction and manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  last_col = tuple(r[-1] for r in I)
  shifted_grid = tuple(tuple(last_col[i]) + I[i][:-1] for i in range(len(I)))
  return shifted_grid
```
**Explanation:**
- First, we extract the last column from the input grid `I`.
- Then, we create the shifted grid by iterating through rows and combining the corresponding element from the last column with the remaining elements of each row in `I`.

**Version 4:** (Leveraging `hconcat`, `rot90`, and list comprehension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat([rot90(I)[-1:] for _ in range(len(I))], rot270(rot90(I)[:-1]))
```
**Explanation:**
-  Extract the last column of the rotated input (`rot90(I)[-1:]`).
- Duplicate the extracted column to match the height of the input grid.
- Remove the last column from the rotated input (`rot90(I)[:-1]`) and rotate it back to its original orientation (`rot270`).
-  Finally, horizontally concatenate the duplicated column with the remaining grid using `hconcat`.

**Version 5:** (Emphasizing modular arithmetic for index calculation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    w = len(I[0])
    return tuple(tuple(I[i][(j-1)%w] for j in range(w)) for i in range(len(I)))
```
**Explanation:**
- We get the width `w` of the input grid.
- For each cell, we calculate its new column index `j` by subtracting 1 from its original index and taking the modulo `w` (`(j-1)%w`). This effectively shifts all columns to the right and wraps the last column to the beginning.


These five versions showcase diverse ways to achieve the same transformation using the DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided functions.
