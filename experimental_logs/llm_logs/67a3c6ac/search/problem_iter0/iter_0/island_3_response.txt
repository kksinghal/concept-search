## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving specific objects within the input grid to the left. The objects are defined by connected cells of the same digit. The movement continues until the object's leftmost cells align with the left edge of the grid. 

**Input 0:**
- The object '2' is moved left until it reaches the left edge. 

**Input 1:**
- The object '2' is moved left until it reaches the left edge.

**Input 2:**
- The object '1' is moved left until it reaches the left edge.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_d0f5fe59(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects from the input grid
    moved_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        leftmost_j = leftmost(obj) # Find the leftmost column index of the object
        moved_objs = insert(shift(obj, (0, -leftmost_j)), moved_objs) # Shift the object to align with the left edge
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), moved_objs) # Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas with the background color
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2.  **Iterate and Move:** For each object, we calculate its leftmost column index (`leftmost(obj)`) and shift the object left by that amount (`shift(obj, (0, -leftmost_j))`). 
3.  **Paint to Canvas:** A blank canvas is created with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`). The moved objects are then painted onto this canvas using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_d0f5fe59(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    moved_grid = I
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
            moved_grid = fill(moved_grid, v, {(i, j - leftmost_j)}) # Move each cell individually
    O = moved_grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2.  **Iterate and Fill:**  Iterate through each cell of each object.  Calculate the shift amount and use `fill` to directly place the cell at its new location on the `moved_grid`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_d0f5fe59(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        O = cover(O, obj)  # Remove the object from the grid
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, -leftmost(obj)))) # Paint the shifted object back onto the grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2.  **Cover and Repaint:** For each object, we first "erase" it from the grid using `cover`. Then, we calculate the left shift and repaint the object at its new position using `paint`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_d0f5fe59(I):
    transformed_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Initialize an empty grid
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: (i, j) in toindices(x)) # Find the object containing the current cell
            leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
            transformed_grid = fill(transformed_grid, I[i][j], {(i, j - leftmost_j)}) # Place the cell at the correct position
    O = transformed_grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialize Empty Grid:** Create a canvas representing the final grid.
2.  **Iterate and Find Object:** For each cell in the input, find the object it belongs to.
3.  **Calculate Shift and Fill:**  Determine the shift amount for the object and place the cell in its shifted position on the `transformed_grid`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_d0f5fe59(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(width(I)):
        column = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I))) # Get all indices of the current column
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
            if vmatching(obj, column): # Check if the object intersects the current column
                O = cover(O, obj) # Erase the object
                O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, -leftmost(obj)))) # Repaint the object shifted to the left
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate by Columns:** This version processes the grid column by column. 
2.  **Object Intersection:** For each column, it checks which objects intersect it.
3.  **Erase and Repaint:** Intersecting objects are erased and then repainted after being shifted left.
