## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves mirroring the input grid along the counter-diagonal and then swapping the left and right halves of the resulting grid. 

Let's break down the transformation for each example:

**Input_0:**

```
6 6 6 2
6 1 6 2
7 2 7 2
1 7 2 2
```

After counter-diagonal mirroring:

```
2 2 6 1
2 7 1 6
2 6 6 6
2 2 7 7 
```

After swapping left and right halves:

```
2 6 6 6
2 6 1 6
2 7 2 7
2 2 7 1
```

**Input_1 and Input_2** follow the same transformation logic.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(righthalf(cmirror(I)), lefthalf(cmirror(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `cmirror(I)`: Mirrors the input grid `I` along the counter-diagonal.
2.  `righthalf(...)` and `lefthalf(...)`: Extracts the right and left halves of the mirrored grid, respectively.
3.  `hconcat(...)`: Concatenates the right half and left half horizontally to produce the final output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mirrored = cmirror(I)
  h, w = len(mirrored), len(mirrored[0])
  return tuple(mirrored[i][w//2:] + mirrored[i][:w//2] for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `mirrored = cmirror(I)`: Mirrors the input grid `I` along the counter-diagonal.
2.  `h, w = len(mirrored), len(mirrored[0])`: Calculates the height and width of the mirrored grid.
3.  The code then iterates through each row of the mirrored grid and constructs a new row by concatenating the right half (`mirrored[i][w//2:]`) and left half (`mirrored[i][:w//2]`) of the row. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = cmirror(I)
    x2 = rot90(x1)
    x3 = hmirror(x2)
    x4 = rot270(x3)
    return x4
```

**Explanation:**

1. `x1 = cmirror(I)`: Mirrors the input grid `I` along the counter-diagonal.
2. `x2 = rot90(x1)`: Rotates the mirrored grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3. `x3 = hmirror(x2)`: Mirrors the rotated grid horizontally.
4. `x4 = rot270(x3)`: Rotates the mirrored grid 270 degrees clockwise (effectively undoing the initial 90-degree rotation).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = cmirror(I)
    x2 = tuple(zip(*x1[::-1]))
    return tuple(zip(*x2[::-1]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `x1 = cmirror(I)`: Mirrors the input grid `I` along the counter-diagonal.
2. `x2 = tuple(zip(*x1[::-1]))`: This line effectively swaps the left and right halves of the mirrored grid by first reversing the order of rows (`[::-1]`) and then transposing the grid (`zip(*...)`).
3. `return tuple(zip(*x2[::-1]))`: The final line applies the same swapping operation again, effectively undoing the first swap and resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(tuple(I[j][w-1-i] for j in range(w-1,-1,-1)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`: Calculates the height and width of the input grid.
2. The code iterates through each cell of the output grid and directly calculates the corresponding cell value from the input grid using the formula `I[j][w-1-i]`. This formula directly maps the indices after the counter-diagonal mirroring and swapping operations. 

Each of these versions uses a different combination of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
