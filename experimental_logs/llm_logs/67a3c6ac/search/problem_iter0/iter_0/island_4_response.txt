## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in all three input-output pairs involves rotating the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. 

**Let's break it down:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The top row of the input (6 6 6 2) becomes the rightmost column of the output (2 6 6 6), but flipped. Similarly, the second row, third row, and fourth row of the input become the third, second, and first columns of the output respectively, also flipped.

* **Input_1 to Output_1:** The same pattern of 90-degree counterclockwise rotation and flipping each column is observed.

* **Input_2 to Output_2:** This input-output pair confirms the pattern.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" in the DSL provided, inspired by existing programs and optimized for the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    return rot270(I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `rot270` function from the DSL, which directly performs a 270-degree rotation on the input grid (`I`). This is equivalent to rotating the grid 90 degrees counterclockwise, directly achieving the desired transformation.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return tuple(zip(*I[::-1]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes Python's built-in `zip` and list slicing functions. 
* `I[::-1]` reverses the order of rows in the input grid.
* `zip(*I[::-1])` transposes the reversed grid.  
The combined effect is a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (len(I[0]), len(I)))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      O[j][len(I)-1-i] = I[i][j]
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version manually iterates through the input grid and places each element in its correct position in a new output grid (`O`) to achieve the rotation. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    return hmirror(rot90(hmirror(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a combination of rotation and mirroring functions.
* `hmirror(I)` first mirrors the input grid horizontally.
* `rot90(...)` rotates the mirrored grid 90 degrees clockwise.
* The final `hmirror(...)` mirrors the result horizontally again. 

The combination of two horizontal mirrors and a 90-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a single 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    return vmirror(rot90(vmirror(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 4 but uses vertical mirroring instead of horizontal mirroring.
* `vmirror(I)` first mirrors the input grid vertically.
* `rot90(...)` rotates the mirrored grid 90 degrees clockwise.
* The final `vmirror(...)` mirrors the result vertically again.

This combination of two vertical mirrors and a 90-degree clockwise rotation also achieves the desired 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.
