## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve taking the rightmost column of the input grid and placing it to the left of the grid, effectively shifting all columns one position to the right.

**Input_0:**

- The last column (2 2 2 2) is moved to the first column.
- The rest of the columns are shifted one position to the right.

**Input_1:**

- The last column (2 1 6 2 2 1 6) is moved to the first column.
- The rest of the columns are shifted one position to the right.

**Input_2:**

- The last column (1 6 1 2 1 2) is moved to the first column.
- The rest of the columns are shifted one position to the right.

## Code Generation:

Here are five different versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` that achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  This version uses slicing and concatenation to achieve the transformation.
  """
  last_column = tuple(row[-1:] for row in I)
  remaining_grid = tuple(row[:-1] for row in I)
  O = tuple(a + b for a, b in zip(last_column, remaining_grid))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract the last column:** `last_column = tuple(row[-1:] for row in I)` creates a new grid containing only the last element of each row from the input grid.
2. **Extract the remaining grid:** `remaining_grid = tuple(row[:-1] for row in I)` creates a new grid containing all but the last element of each row from the input grid.
3. **Concatenate horizontally:** `O = tuple(a + b for a, b in zip(last_column, remaining_grid))` combines the `last_column` with the `remaining_grid`, effectively shifting all columns one position to the right and placing the last column at the beginning.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    """
    This version uses rot90 and hconcat to achieve the transformation.
    """
    rotated = rot90(I)
    left_part = tuple(rotated[-1:] for _ in range(len(I)))
    right_part = tuple(rotated[:-1])
    O = hconcat(left_part, rot270(right_part))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate 90 degrees:** `rotated = rot90(I)` rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **Extract left part:** `left_part = tuple(rotated[-1:] for _ in range(len(I)))` extracts the last row of the rotated grid (which corresponds to the last column of the input) and replicates it to match the input grid's height.
3. **Extract right part:** `right_part = tuple(rotated[:-1])` extracts all but the last row of the rotated grid.
4. **Concatenate and rotate back:** `O = hconcat(left_part, rot270(right_part))` concatenates the `left_part` with the `right_part` rotated 270 degrees counterclockwise (effectively rotating it back to its original orientation) resulting in the desired transformation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    """
    This version uses hsplit and hconcat to achieve the transformation.
    """
    left_part, right_part = hsplit(I, len(I[0]) - 1)
    O = hconcat(left_part, right_part)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split horizontally:** `left_part, right_part = hsplit(I, len(I[0]) - 1)` splits the grid horizontally into two parts: the last column (`left_part`) and the remaining grid (`right_part`).
2. **Concatenate horizontally:** `O = hconcat(left_part, right_part)` concatenates the `left_part` with the `right_part`, effectively achieving the desired transformation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  This version iterates through rows and elements to achieve the transformation.
  """
  O = tuple()
  for row in I:
    new_row = row[-1:] + row[:-1]
    O = O + (new_row,)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The code iterates through each `row` in the input grid `I`.
2. **Shift elements:** For each `row`, `new_row = row[-1:] + row[:-1]` creates a new tuple where the last element of the row is placed at the beginning, effectively shifting all elements one position to the right.
3. **Construct output grid:** The `new_row` is then added to the `O` tuple, building the output grid row by row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  This version uses functional programming with apply and lambda functions.
  """
  shift_row = lambda row: row[-1:] + row[:-1]
  O = apply(shift_row, I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define shift function:** `shift_row = lambda row: row[-1:] + row[:-1]` defines a lambda function that takes a row and returns a new row with the last element moved to the beginning.
2. **Apply to each row:** `O = apply(shift_row, I)` applies the `shift_row` function to each row in the input grid `I`, effectively achieving the desired transformation.


These are just five examples, and there are likely many other valid solutions using different combinations of functions from the DSL. The key is to understand the underlying transformation logic and then find creative ways to implement it using the available functions.
