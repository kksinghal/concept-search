## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as a **90-degree clockwise rotation followed by a horizontal reflection (mirroring)**. 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**

1. **Rotation:** Rotating the input grid 90 degrees clockwise results in:
   ```
   1 7 6 6
   2 2 1 6
   7 2 6 6
   2 2 2 2
   ```

2. **Reflection:** Reflecting this rotated grid horizontally produces the output grid:
   ```
   2 6 6 6
   2 6 1 6
   2 7 2 7
   2 2 7 1
   ```

**Pair 1 & 2:** The same logic of rotation followed by reflection holds true for these input-output pairs as well. 


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code utilizing the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise and then reflects it horizontally.
  """
  return hmirror(rot270(I)) # Rotate 270 degrees counter-clockwise, then horizontally mirror
```

**Explanation:**

- `rot270(I)` performs a 270-degree counter-clockwise rotation, which is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
- `hmirror(...)` then reflects the rotated grid horizontally, achieving the final transformation.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Achieves the transformation by directly placing each element in its final position.
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (w, h)) # Create a blank canvas of the correct size
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], ((w - 1 - j), i)) # Place element at its rotated and reflected position
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each cell of the input grid.
- For each cell (i, j), it calculates the target position after rotation and reflection, which is (w-1-j, i).
- It then fills the canvas `O` at the calculated target position with the value from the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Utilizes transposing and reversing to achieve the desired rotation and reflection.
  """
  O = tuple(zip(*I[::-1])) # Transpose the grid and reverse the order of rows
  O = tuple(tuple(row[::-1]) for row in O) # Reverse each row in the transposed grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- `zip(*I[::-1])` transposes the input grid and reverses the order of rows, effectively performing a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
- `tuple(row[::-1] for row in ...)` then reverses each row of the transposed grid, achieving the horizontal reflection.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Combines horizontal mirroring with a vertical flip to achieve the transformation.
  """
  return vmirror(hmirror(rot90(I))) # Rotate 90 degrees, mirror horizontally, then flip vertically
```

**Explanation:**

- `rot90(I)` first performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
- `hmirror(...)` then reflects the rotated grid horizontally.
- Finally, `vmirror(...)` flips the grid vertically, resulting in the final output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Leverages diagonal mirroring and rotations to achieve the transformation.
  """
  return rot180(dmirror(rot90(I))) # Rotate 90 degrees, mirror diagonally, then rotate 180 degrees
```

**Explanation:**

- `rot90(I)` performs the initial 90-degree clockwise rotation.
- `dmirror(...)` then mirrors the rotated grid diagonally.
- Finally, `rot180(...)` performs a 180-degree rotation on the mirrored grid, resulting in the final output. 

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation using the DSL, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided functions.
