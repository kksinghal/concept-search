## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids is a **clockwise rotation by 90 degrees**. This means that each row in the input grid becomes a column in the output grid, and the order of elements in each column is reversed.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return rot90(I)
```

**Explanation:** 

This version directly utilizes the `rot90` function from the DSL, which performs a clockwise rotation of the input grid by 90 degrees.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(zip(*I[::-1]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes Python's built-in functions to achieve the rotation:
- `I[::-1]` reverses the order of rows in the input grid.
- `zip(*...)` transposes the grid, effectively turning rows into columns.
- `tuple()` converts the result back into a tuple of tuples, representing the 2D grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(tuple(I[j][w-1-i] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested loops to iterate through the grid and constructs the rotated grid element by element:
- `h, w = len(I), len(I[0])` gets the height and width of the input grid.
- The outer loop iterates through rows (`i`) and the inner loop through columns (`j`).
- `I[j][w-1-i]` accesses the element in the original grid that should be placed at position `(i, j)` in the rotated grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hmirror(rot270(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a combination of rotation and mirroring functions:
- `rot270(I)` rotates the input grid anticlockwise by 270 degrees.
- `hmirror(...)` mirrors the resulting grid horizontally, achieving the final 90-degree clockwise rotation.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return vmirror(rot180(I))
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to version 4, this version uses a different combination of rotation and mirroring:
- `rot180(I)` rotates the input grid by 180 degrees.
- `vmirror(...)` mirrors the resulting grid vertically, achieving the final 90-degree clockwise rotation. 

Each of these versions implements the same transformation (90-degree clockwise rotation) using different combinations of functions from the provided DSL.
