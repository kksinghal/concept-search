## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects within the input grid and recoloring them to the value '2'.  Let's break down the pattern:

* **Target Objects:** The transformation targets objects that were originally composed of the digit '1' in the input grid.
* **Recoloring:** These target objects are recolored to the value '2' in the output grid.
* **Background Preservation:** The remaining digits in the grid, representing the background, remain unchanged.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_1b2d62fb(I):
  # Identify objects formed by the digit '1'.
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)

  # Recolor the target objects to '2'.
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, obj), target_objs)

  # Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Objects:** We first use `objects` to find all connected objects in the grid. Then, `colorfilter` isolates objects initially formed by the digit '1'.
2. **Recolor:** The `apply` function applies `recolor(2, obj)` to each target object, changing their color to '2'.
3. **Paint:**  A blank canvas is created using `canvas`. The `paint` function then draws the recolored objects onto this canvas, resulting in the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_1b2d62fb(I):
  # Create a mask by replacing '1' with '2' and others with '0'.
  mask = replace(replace(I, 1, 2), 0, 0)

  # Combine the mask with the original grid using cellwise matching.
  O = cellwise(mask, I, 0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Mask:** Two nested `replace` calls create a mask where '1's are replaced by '2' and all other digits are replaced by '0'. 
2. **Cellwise Combination:** `cellwise` compares the mask and original grid. If the values match (both '2'), the output grid retains '2'. Otherwise, it defaults to '0', effectively preserving the background.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_1b2d62fb(I):
    # Find indices of all occurrences of '1'.
    indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
    
    # Create a blank canvas.
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))

    # Fill the canvas with '2' at the identified indices.
    O = fill(O, 2, indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Indices:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` directly identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **Blank Canvas:** A blank canvas is created using `canvas`.
3. **Fill:** The `fill` function places the value '2' at the previously identified indices on the blank canvas, effectively recoloring the target cells.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_1b2d62fb(I):
  # Iterate through the grid cell by cell.
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = []
  for i in range(h):
    row = []
    for j in range(w):
      # If the cell value is '1', recolor to '2'; otherwise, keep the original value.
      value = 2 if I[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j]
      row.append(value)
    O.append(row)
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate:** This program iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:**  For each cell, it checks if the value is '1'. If yes, it's recolored to '2'; otherwise, the original value is retained.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_1b2d62fb(I):
  # Partition the grid based on color.
  parts = partition(I)
  
  # Recolor partitions containing '1' to '2'.
  recolored_parts = apply(lambda part: recolor(2, part) if color(part) == 1 else part, parts)

  # Combine the recolored partitions to form the output grid.
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for part in recolored_parts:
    O = paint(O, part)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:**  The grid is divided into separate objects based on color using `partition`.
2. **Selective Recoloring:** The `apply` function iterates through each partition. If a partition's color is '1' (obtained using `color`), it's recolored to '2'; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
3. **Combine Partitions:**  A blank canvas is created, and the recolored partitions are painted onto it one by one, resulting in the final output grid.
