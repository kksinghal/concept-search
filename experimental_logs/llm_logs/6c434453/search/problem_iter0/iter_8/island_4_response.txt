## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects bordering the edge of the grid, recoloring them to '2', and then shifting them inwards towards the center. The direction of the shift is determined by the object's position relative to the grid's center.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. Objects touching the borders are identified: top row '1's, rightmost '1's, bottom '1', and bottom right '1's.
2. These objects are recolored to '2'.
3. The top row '2' shifts down, rightmost '2's shift left, bottom '2' shifts up, and bottom right '2's shift up and left.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. Bordering objects identified: top right '1's, rightmost '1's, bottom right '1's.
2. Recolored to '2'.
3. Top right '2's shift down and left, rightmost '2's shift left, bottom right '2's shift up and left.

## Program Versions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  border_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, obj), border_objs)
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    v_dir = sign(centerofmass(obj)[0] - h // 2)
    h_dir = sign(centerofmass(obj)[1] - w // 2)
    shifted_objs.add(shift(obj, (-v_dir, -h_dir)))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify bordering objects:** Similar to the provided programs, this version identifies objects touching the border using `objects`, `mfilter`, and `bordering`.
2. **Recolor:** Recolors the bordering objects to '2' using `apply` and `recolor`.
3. **Shift towards center:** Calculates the direction towards the center using `centerofmass` and `sign`. Shifts each object one step in that direction using `shift`.
4. **Paint on canvas:** Paints the shifted objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for obj in objs:
    if bordering(obj, I):
      ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)
      target_i = ci - sign(ci - h // 2)
      target_j = cj - sign(cj - w // 2)
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(obj, (target_i - ci, target_j - cj))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Iterates through all objects in the input.
2. **Conditional recolor and shift:** For each object, if it's bordering, it calculates the shift direction and magnitude to move its center of mass one step towards the grid's center. It then recolors the object to '2' and applies the calculated shift.
3. **Paint on canvas:** Paints each object, shifted or unshifted, onto a blank canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: branch(bordering(obj, I), shift(recolor(2, obj), (crement(centerofmass(obj)[0] - h // 2), crement(centerofmass(obj)[1] - w // 2))), obj), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, (h, w)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional approach:** This version utilizes a more functional approach using `mapply` and `branch`. 
2. **Conditional logic within `mapply`:** For each object, `mapply` applies a lambda function which uses `branch` to conditionally apply the transformation.
3. **Recolor and shift:** If the object borders the grid, it's recolored and shifted one step towards the center using `crement` on the difference between its center of mass and the grid's center. 
4. **Paint on canvas:**  The transformed objects are then painted onto a blank canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if bordering(obj, I):
      target = (
          uppermost(obj) - sign(uppermost(obj) - h // 2),
          leftmost(obj) - sign(leftmost(obj) - w // 2)
      )
      shifted_objs.add(shift(recolor(2, obj), (target[0] - uppermost(obj), target[1] - leftmost(obj))))
    else:
      shifted_objs.add(obj)
  O = paint(canvas(0, (h, w)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and conditionally shift:** Iterates through all objects, and for those touching the border, calculates the target position for their top-left corner to move one step inwards.
2. **Recolor and shift:** Recolors bordering objects to '2' and applies the calculated shift using `shift`.
3. **Paint on canvas:** Paints all objects, shifted or unshifted, onto a blank canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if any((i == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == 0 or j == w - 1) for i, j in toindices(obj)):
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, (sign(h // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[0]), sign(w // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1])))
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shifted_obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and check for border contact:** Iterates through each object and checks if any of its cells are on the grid border using a generator expression.
2. **Shift and recolor:**  If the object touches the border, it's shifted one step towards the center based on its center of mass and then recolored to '2'.
3. **Paint on canvas:** Each object, shifted and recolored or untouched, is painted onto a blank canvas.


These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation using various DSL functions and logic.  Each version demonstrates a different way to identify bordering objects, calculate the shift, and apply the recoloring, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
