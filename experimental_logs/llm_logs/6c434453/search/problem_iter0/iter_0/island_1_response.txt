## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects in the input grid and repositioning them in the output grid. The repositioning seems based on object size and relative location. 

**Input 0:**

* The largest object (1s) remains in its original position.
* The second-largest object (a group of connected 1s) moves to the right and down, forming a diagonal line. 
* A new object (2s) appears, resembling the shape of the moved object, but mirrored and placed in the original location of the moved object.

**Input 1:**

* The largest object (1s) remains in its original position.
* The second largest object (a group of connected 1s) moves down and slightly to the right.
* A new object (2s) appears, mirroring the shape of the moved object, and is placed in the original location of the moved object. 

**Overall:**

* The largest object always stays in place.
* The second largest object is relocated.
* A new object, mimicking the shape and original position of the relocated object, is introduced. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions inspired by the provided programs and tailored to the transformation analysis:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find the two largest objects
  obj1 = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size)
  obj2 = argmax(remove(obj1, objects(I, T, F, T)), size)
  
  # Get the relative position of the second largest object
  rel_pos = position(obj2, obj1)

  # Calculate the new position for the second largest object
  new_pos = add(centerofmass(obj1), multiply(rel_pos, shape(obj2))) 
  
  # Create the new object by mirroring and placing it at the original location
  new_obj = recolor(TWO, shift(hmirror(obj2), centerofmass(obj2)))

  # Construct the output grid
  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), obj1), shift(obj2, subtract(new_pos, centerofmass(obj2))))
  O = paint(O, new_obj)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Find the largest (`obj1`) and second-largest (`obj2`) objects.
2. **Relative Position:** Calculate the relative position (`rel_pos`) of `obj2` to `obj1`.
3. **New Position:** Determine the new position (`new_pos`) of `obj2` based on its relative position and the size of `obj1`.
4. **Create New Object:** Create `new_obj` by mirroring `obj2` horizontally and placing it at the original location of `obj2`.
5. **Construct Output:** Paint `obj1` and the shifted `obj2` to a blank canvas. Then, paint `new_obj` to complete the output grid.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find objects, sort by size, and extract the top two
  objs = order(objects(I, T, F, T), size)
  obj1, obj2 = objs[-1], objs[-2]
  
  # Mirror the second largest object
  mirrored_obj2 = hmirror(obj2)

  # Calculate the offset to position the mirrored object
  offset = subtract(centerofmass(obj1), centerofmass(mirrored_obj2))
  
  # Paint the objects onto the output grid
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), obj1)
  O = paint(O, shift(obj2, offset))
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, shift(mirrored_obj2, offset)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Objects:** Find all objects, sort them by size, and take the two largest (`obj1`, `obj2`).
2. **Mirror Object:** Create a horizontally mirrored version (`mirrored_obj2`) of `obj2`.
3. **Calculate Offset:** Determine the offset needed to align `mirrored_obj2`'s center of mass with `obj1`'s center of mass.
4. **Construct Output:** Paint `obj1`, the shifted `obj2`, and the mirrored object (`mirrored_obj2`) with color 2 onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Extract objects based on color
    obj1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)
    obj2 = argmax(remove(obj1, objects(I, T, F, T)), size)
    
    # Calculate the new position of the second object
    new_pos = add(centerofmass(obj1), position(obj2, obj1))

    # Create a new object by mirroring the shape of the second object
    new_obj = recolor(TWO, hmirror(shift(obj2, subtract(centerofmass(obj2), (0, width(obj2))))))
    
    # Assemble the final grid
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), obj1)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, subtract(new_pos, centerofmass(obj2))))
    O = paint(O, shift(new_obj, subtract(centerofmass(obj1), centerofmass(new_obj))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract the object with color 1 (`obj1`) and find the second-largest object (`obj2`).
2. **New Position:** Calculate `new_pos` for `obj2` based on its relative position to `obj1`. 
3. **Create Mirrored Object:** Create `new_obj` by mirroring `obj2` and adjusting its position for alignment.
4. **Construct Output:** Paint `obj1`, shifted `obj2`, and shifted `new_obj` onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Find largest object and others
    largest_obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size)
    other_objs = remove(largest_obj, objects(I, T, F, T))
    
    # Find the second largest object
    second_largest_obj = argmax(other_objs, size)

    #  Move the second largest object to the top-right of the largest
    new_pos = add(urcorner(largest_obj), (1, 1))
    moved_obj = shift(second_largest_obj, subtract(new_pos, ulcorner(second_largest_obj)))

    # Create a new object that's a horizontally mirrored version of the second largest
    mirrored_obj = recolor(TWO, hmirror(second_largest_obj))

    # Place the mirrored object at the original location of the second largest
    placed_mirrored_obj = shift(mirrored_obj, subtract(centerofmass(second_largest_obj), centerofmass(mirrored_obj)))
    
    # Combine all the objects onto a blank canvas
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), largest_obj)
    O = paint(O, moved_obj)
    O = paint(O, placed_mirrored_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find the largest object (`largest_obj`) and the remaining objects (`other_objs`). Determine the second-largest object (`second_largest_obj`).
2. **Move Second Largest:** Move `second_largest_obj` to the top-right of `largest_obj`.
3. **Create Mirrored Object:** Create a mirrored version (`mirrored_obj`) of `second_largest_obj` with color 2.
4. **Place Mirrored Object:** Place `mirrored_obj` at the original location of `second_largest_obj`.
5. **Construct Output:** Combine  `largest_obj`, the moved object, and the mirrored object on a blank canvas. 


**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Find the largest and second largest objects
    obj1 = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size)
    obj2 = argmax(remove(obj1, objects(I, T, F, T)), size)

    # Determine the mirroring axis based on relative object positions
    mirror_axis = vfrontier(center(obj1)) if vmatching(obj1, obj2) else hfrontier(center(obj1))

    # Reflect the second object across the determined axis
    reflected_obj2 = recolor(TWO, hmirror(obj2) if vmatching(obj1, obj2) else vmirror(obj2))
  
    # Position the reflected object on the opposite side of the mirroring axis
    new_pos = subtract(multiply(gravitate(reflected_obj2, obj1), TWO), (ONE, ONE)) 
    placed_obj2 = shift(reflected_obj2, new_pos)

    # Combine all objects onto a blank canvas to form the output
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), obj1)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, subtract(centerofmass(obj1), centerofmass(obj2))))
    O = paint(O, placed_obj2)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify the largest (`obj1`) and second-largest (`obj2`) objects.
2. **Determine Mirroring Axis:** Calculate the mirroring axis based on whether `obj1` and `obj2` share a row or column.
3. **Reflect Object:** Reflect `obj2` across the determined axis and recolor it to 2 (`reflected_obj2`).
4. **Position Reflected Object:** Calculate `new_pos` to place `reflected_obj2` on the opposite side of the mirroring axis, ensuring it doesn't overlap with `obj1`.
5. **Construct Output:** Combine `obj1`, the shifted `obj2`, and the placed `reflected_obj2` on a blank canvas.
