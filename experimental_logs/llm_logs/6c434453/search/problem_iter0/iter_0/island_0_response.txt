## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples seems to involve identifying objects (clusters of connected cells with the same value) within the input grid and then redrawing them in a new location within the output grid.  

**Key Observations:**

* **Object Preservation:** The objects in the input grid are preserved in the output grid, although their positions are changed. 
* **Background Fill:** The output grid is initially filled with a background color (0 in these examples) and the objects are drawn on top.
* **Specific Movement Pattern:** There seems to be a pattern in how objects are moved, but it's not immediately clear from these two examples alone. Further examples would be needed to deduce the exact movement logic.

## Code Generation:

Since you haven't provided the two existing programs to improve upon, I'll provide five distinct program versions based on the transformation analysis and the DSL functions.

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))) for obj in objs) # Example shift logic, needs refinement
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs)) # Paint on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`). `T, F, T` specifies that objects are univalued, not diagonally connected, and the background should be excluded.
2. **`shifted_objs = ...`:** This line applies a shift to each object. The shift logic `(lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))` is just an example and needs to be refined based on the actual movement pattern observed in more input-output pairs.
3. **`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with the value `ZERO`.
4. **`paint(..., merge(shifted_objs))`:**  Paints the shifted objects onto the blank canvas, creating the output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  objs = partition(I) # Partition grid into objects based on color
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != ZERO: # Exclude background
      new_pos = (uppermost(obj) * 2, leftmost(obj) * 2) # Example movement logic
      moved_objs = insert(shift(obj, new_pos), moved_objs) 
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`partition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid into objects based on color.
2. **Loop:** Iterates through each extracted object.
3. **`if color(obj) != ZERO:`:**  Excludes the background object.
4. **`new_pos = ...`:**  Calculates the new position for each object. The logic `(uppermost(obj) * 2, leftmost(obj) * 2)` is an example and needs to be adjusted based on the actual movement pattern.
5. **`shift(obj, new_pos)`:** Shifts the object to its new position.
6. **`paint(...)`:**  Paints the moved objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_objs = frozenset()
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    new_pos = (i, i)  # Example movement based on object index
    new_objs = insert(shift(obj, new_pos), new_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), new_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts non-background objects.
2. **Loop:** Iterates through each extracted object.
3. **`new_pos = (i, i)`:** Calculates a new position for the object based on its index in the `objs` set. This is just an example, requiring adjustment to match the actual transformation. 
4. **`shift(obj, new_pos)`:** Shifts the object.
5. **`paint(...)`:** Paints the shifted objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Partitions the grid, excluding background
  placed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    target_loc = (uppermost(obj) + width(obj), leftmost(obj) + height(obj)) # Example target location
    offset = subtract(target_loc, ulcorner(obj))
    placed_objs = insert(shift(obj, offset), placed_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), placed_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the grid into objects, excluding the background.
2. **Loop:** Iterates through each extracted object.
3. **`target_loc = ...`:** Determines a target location for the object based on its dimensions. The example logic here is just a placeholder.
4. **`offset = ...`:** Calculates the required offset to move the object's upper-left corner to the `target_loc`.
5. **`shift(obj, offset)`:**  Shifts the object.
6. **`paint(...)`:**  Paints the shifted objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj) # Calculate center of mass
    new_pos = (center_i * 2, center_j * 2) # Example movement logic
    transformed_objs = insert(shift(obj, new_pos), transformed_objs) 
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), transformed_objs) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts non-background objects.
2. **Loop:** Iterates through each object.
3. **`center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)`:**  Calculates the center of mass of the object.
4. **`new_pos = ...`:** Determines a new position based on the center of mass. The logic here needs to be refined based on the observed transformation pattern.
5. **`shift(obj, new_pos)`:**  Shifts the object.
6. **`paint(...)`:** Paints the shifted objects.


**Important Notes:**

* The provided programs are starting points and might not produce the exact desired outputs with the example movement logic.
* To achieve a perfect score (similarity score of 0), you need to analyze additional input-output pairs to understand the precise movement pattern and refine the `new_pos` or `offset` calculation logic accordingly. 
* Experiment with different DSL functions and combinations to find the most efficient and elegant solution.
