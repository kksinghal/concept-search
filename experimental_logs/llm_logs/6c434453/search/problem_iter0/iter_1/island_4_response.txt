## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**  The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' and replacing them with a new object formed by the digit '2'. The new '2' object is positioned in the same relative location within its bounding box as the original '1' object was positioned within its bounding box. The rest of the grid is filled with '0'.

**Input 1 to Output 1:** This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one.  Objects formed by the digit '1' are replaced with '2' objects. The relative positioning within their bounding boxes is maintained, and the background is filled with '0'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = normalize(obj)
    new_obj = recolor(TWO, shifted_obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(new_obj, ulcorner(toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects formed by digits other than the background (most frequent color) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** `O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates an empty output grid `O` of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.
3. **Iterate and Transform:** The code iterates through each identified object `obj`. 
4. **Normalize:** `shifted_obj = normalize(obj)` shifts each object so its top-left corner is at the origin.
5. **Recolor:** `new_obj = recolor(TWO, shifted_obj)` replaces the object's color with the digit '2'.
6. **Position and Paint:** `O = paint(O, shift(new_obj, ulcorner(toindices(obj))))` shifts the new '2' object back to its original bounding box location and paints it onto the output grid `O`.
7. **Return Output:** Finally, the transformed grid `O` is returned.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        ul = ulcorner(obj)
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i - ul[0], j - ul[1]))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas `O` filled with zeros, having the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Loop through each object in the input grid `I`.
3. **Upper-Left Corner:**  Determine the upper-left corner coordinates `ul` of the current object's bounding box.
4. **Cell-wise Transformation:**  For each cell `(i, j)` within the object:
    -  Calculate the relative position `(i - ul[0], j - ul[1])` of the cell with respect to the upper-left corner.
    -  Create a new object containing a single cell with value '2' at the calculated relative position.
    -  Paint this new object onto the canvas `O`.
5. **Output:** Return the final transformed canvas `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = replace(I, mostcommon(I), ZERO)
    for obj in objs:
        O = underpaint(O, recolor(TWO, normalize(shift(obj, invert(ulcorner(obj))))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all objects in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Clear Background:**  `O = replace(I, mostcommon(I), ZERO)` creates a new grid `O` by replacing the background color in the input grid with zeros.
3. **Iterate and Transform:** The code loops through each identified object `obj`:
4. **Normalize and Recolor:**  `recolor(TWO, normalize(shift(obj, invert(ulcorner(obj))))))` first shifts the object to the origin, then recolors it to '2'.
5. **Underpaint:** `O = underpaint(O, ...)` paints the transformed object onto the output grid `O` only at positions where `O` currently has the background color (zero). This ensures the new object doesn't overwrite any existing non-background cells.
6. **Return Output:** The transformed grid `O` is returned.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        offset = subtract(centerofmass(obj), centerofmass(normalize(obj)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, shift(obj, offset)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a canvas `O` of the same size as the input `I`, filled with zeros.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through each object in the input grid.
3. **Calculate Offset:**  Determine the offset required to shift the object's center of mass to the center of mass of its normalized version (which is always at the center of its bounding box).
4. **Shift and Recolor:**  Shift the object by the calculated offset and recolor it to '2'.
5. **Paint:**  Paint the transformed object onto the canvas.
6. **Output:**  Return the final transformed canvas.


**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    transformed_objects = []
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        normalized_obj = normalize(obj)
        transformed_objects.append(recolor(TWO, normalized_obj))
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for i, obj in enumerate(transformed_objects):
        original_obj = list(objects(I, T, F, T))[i]
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, ulcorner(original_obj)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Transformation:** 
   - Iterate over each object in the input.
   - Normalize the object to bring its top-left corner to (0,0).
   - Recolor the normalized object to '2'.
   - Store the transformed object.
2. **Canvas Creation and Painting:**
   - Create a canvas filled with '0's, having the same dimensions as the input.
   - Iterate over the transformed objects.
   - Fetch the corresponding original object from the input.
   - Shift the transformed object to the upper-left corner position of the original object.
   - Paint the shifted object onto the canvas.
3. **Output:** Return the final transformed canvas.
