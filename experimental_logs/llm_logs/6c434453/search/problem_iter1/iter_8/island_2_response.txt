## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of value '1' in the input grid and then drawing a '2' colored border around them, but only on the top and left edges if they touch the edge of the grid.  Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The topmost and leftmost '1's are identified.
* A '2' colored border is drawn on their top and left sides respectively.
* The remaining '1's forming the objects are left untouched.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The same logic applies. Topmost and leftmost '1's of each object get a '2' colored border on their top and left sides. 


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = asobject(I)  
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if uppermost(obj) == 0:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i,j) for i,j in toindices(obj) if i == uppermost(obj)}))
    if leftmost(obj) == 0:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i,j) for i,j in toindices(obj) if j == leftmost(obj)})) 
  return I if len(O) == 0 else paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  The output grid `O` is initialized as an empty object.
2. **Object Iteration:** It iterates over each object of '1's in the input grid `I`.
3. **Top Border:** If the object touches the top edge (`uppermost(obj) == 0`), the top row of the object in `O` is colored with '2'.
4. **Left Border:** Similarly, if the object touches the left edge (`leftmost(obj) == 0`), the leftmost column of the object in `O` is colored with '2'.
5. **Painting:** Finally, the modified object `O` is painted onto an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color. If `O` is empty (no objects were processed), the original input `I` is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    top_edge = {(i,j) for i,j in toindices(obj) if i == uppermost(obj)}
    left_edge = {(i,j) for i,j in toindices(obj) if j == leftmost(obj)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, top_edge if uppermost(obj) == 0 else frozenset()))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, left_edge if leftmost(obj) == 0 else frozenset()))
  return paint(O, asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Creates an output canvas `O` of the same size as the input `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object of '1's in the input grid.
3. **Edge Calculation:** For each object, calculates the indices of its top edge and left edge.
4. **Conditional Painting:** Colors the top edge '2' only if the object touches the top of the grid. Similarly, colors the left edge '2' only if it touches the left edge.
5. **Final Output:** Finally, paints the original object from the input onto the canvas `O` to preserve the original '1's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = asobject(I)
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if uppermost(obj) == 0:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(crop(obj, ulcorner(obj), (1, width(obj))), (0, 0))))
    if leftmost(obj) == 0:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(crop(obj, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), 1)), (0, 0))))
  return I if len(O) == 0 else paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to version 1, initializes `O` as an empty object.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates over each object of '1's.
3. **Edge Cropping:** If an object touches the top, it crops the top row and paints it onto `O` with color '2'. Similarly, it crops and paints the leftmost column if the object touches the left edge.
4. **Painting:**  Finally, the modified `O` is painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if uppermost(obj) == 0:
      O = underfill(O, 2, shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (1, width(obj))), (0, 0)))
    if leftmost(obj) == 0:
      O = underfill(O, 2, shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), 1)), (0, 0)))
  return paint(O, asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates output canvas `O` with the background color.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Iterates over each object.
3. **Conditional Underfill:** If an object touches the top, it uses `underfill` to paint '2' only on the background cells of the top row of that object's bounding box. Similar logic applies to the leftmost column.
4. **Final Output:**  Paints the original objects from the input onto the modified canvas `O`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = asobject(I)
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if uppermost(obj) == 0:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}))
    if leftmost(obj) == 0:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}))
  return I if len(O) == 0 else paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), O) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to versions 1 and 3, it initializes `O` as an empty object.
2. **Object Iteration:** It iterates through each object of '1's in the grid.
3. **Direct Border Drawing:** If the object touches the top edge, it directly calculates and paints the indices for the top border with '2'. Similarly, it handles the left border.
4. **Painting:** Finally, it paints the modified `O` onto a blank canvas.


These five program versions showcase different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation, ensuring diversity in the solutions. Each version has its own logic flow and function usage, demonstrating a range of possibilities within the DSL.
