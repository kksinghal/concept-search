## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects within the grid and shifting them one position to the right. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

1. **Target Objects:** The transformation targets objects formed by the digit '1' that are horizontally aligned and have a single-cell gap from the grid's right border.
2. **Shift:** These target objects are shifted one cell to the right.
3. **Recoloring:**  The shifted objects are recolored to '2'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

1. **Target Objects:**  Similar to Input_0, the transformation targets objects formed by the digit '1' that are horizontally aligned and have a single-cell gap from the grid's right border.
2. **Shift:** The target objects are shifted one cell to the right.
3. **Recoloring:** The shifted objects are recolored to '2'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_right_if_at_border(obj):
    return toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1))) if rightmost(obj) == len(I[0]) - 2 else initset(0)

  shifted_indices = mfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), shift_right_if_at_border)
  O = fill(I, 2, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift_right_if_at_border` Function:** This function checks if an object's rightmost cell is at the second-to-last column of the grid. If true, it shifts the object one cell to the right and returns its indices; otherwise, it returns an empty set.
2. **`objects` Function:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
3. **`mfilter` Function:** Applies the `shift_right_if_at_border` function to each object, merging the resulting indices.
4. **`fill` Function:** Fills the grid 'I' with value '2' at the identified `shifted_indices`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if rightmost(obj) == len(I[0]) - 2: 
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:**  The code iterates through each object identified by the `objects` function.
2. **Border Condition:** For each object, it checks if its rightmost cell is at the second-to-last column.
3. **Shift and Paint:** If the condition is met, it shifts the object one cell to the right, recolors it to '2', and paints it onto the grid 'O'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def conditional_shift(j, v):
    return 2 if v != mostcommon(I) and j == len(I[0]) - 2 else v

  O = tuple(tuple(conditional_shift(j, v) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`conditional_shift` Function:**  This function checks if a cell is not the background color and if its column index is the second-to-last. If both conditions are true, it changes the cell's value to '2'; otherwise, it leaves the value unchanged.
2. **Cell-wise Application:** The code applies the `conditional_shift` function to each cell in the grid 'I'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if rightmost(obj) == len(I[0]) - 2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1)))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:**  The code creates a blank canvas 'O' of the same size and background color as the input grid 'I'.
2. **Selective Painting:** It iterates through each object in 'I', shifting and recoloring only those that meet the border condition before painting them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_objects = frozenset(
      shift(obj, (0, 1)) if rightmost(obj) == len(I[0]) - 2 else obj
      for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)
  )
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(recolor(2, obj) for obj in shifted_objects if rightmost(obj) != len(I[0]) - 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_objects`:** Creates a new set of objects, shifting only those that meet the border condition.
2. **Painting Shifted Objects:**  It paints the shifted and recolored objects onto a blank canvas. 

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages different functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL for this spatial reasoning task.
