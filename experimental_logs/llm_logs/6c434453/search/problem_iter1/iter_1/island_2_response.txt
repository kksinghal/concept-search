## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. The program identifies objects formed by the digit '1'.
2. It recolors the topmost object to the digit '2'.
3. It then relocates each object such that its leftmost point is positioned directly below the rightmost point of the object above it. Objects in the same column maintain their vertical order. 
4. Objects initially located in the rightmost column are moved one position down from their original position.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one, with the following additional points:

1. In the case of overlapping objects after the relocation, the digit '2' takes precedence. 
2.  The single-cell object '1' in the top right corner of the input is handled in the same way as larger objects.


## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # 1. Create a canvas
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  
  # 2. Identify and process objects
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  objs = order(objs, lambda o: (-leftmost(o), uppermost(o)))
  last_rightmost = width(I) 
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    # 3. Determine new position
    new_leftmost = last_rightmost
    if i < len(objs) - 1 and leftmost(objs[i+1]) == leftmost(obj):
      new_topmost = uppermost(objs[i+1]) + height(objs[i+1])
    else:
      new_topmost = uppermost(obj) + 1
    
    # 4. Recolor and paint
    if uppermost(obj) == 0:
      obj = recolor(2, obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (new_topmost, new_leftmost - leftmost(obj))))
    last_rightmost = new_leftmost - 1

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates an empty canvas with the input's background color and dimensions.
2. **Object Ordering:**  Identifies objects formed by '1' and sorts them based on their leftmost column (descending) and then uppermost row (ascending).
3. **Position Calculation:** Determines the new top-left corner of each object based on the previous object's rightmost point and the next object's position (to maintain vertical order).
4. **Recoloring and Painting:**  Recolors the topmost object to '2', shifts the object to its new position, and paints it onto the canvas. 

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  rightmost_positions = {}
  for i in range(width(I)):
    column_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: leftmost(obj) == i)
    for j, obj in enumerate(order(column_objs, lambda o: uppermost(o))):
      if i not in rightmost_positions:
        rightmost_positions[i] = width(I)
      new_leftmost = rightmost_positions[i]
      new_topmost =  uppermost(obj) + 1 if j == 0 else uppermost(obj)
      if uppermost(obj) == 0:
        obj = recolor(2, obj)
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (new_topmost, new_leftmost - leftmost(obj))))
      rightmost_positions[i] = new_leftmost - 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Objects:** Creates a canvas and identifies objects formed by '1' from the input grid.
2. **Column-wise Processing:**  Iterates through columns, tracking the rightmost available position in each column.
3. **Object Placement:**  Within each column, processes objects in ascending order of their uppermost row. Calculates the new position based on the tracked rightmost position and paints the object.
4. **Recoloring:** Recolors the topmost object to '2' during painting.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  objs = order(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: (-leftmost(o), uppermost(o)))
  last_obj_rightmost = width(I)
  for obj in objs:
    new_leftmost = last_obj_rightmost
    if uppermost(obj) == 0:
      obj = recolor(2, obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (uppermost(obj) + 1, new_leftmost - leftmost(obj))))
    last_obj_rightmost = new_leftmost - 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic by directly iterating over objects sorted by column (descending) and row (ascending). It calculates the new position based on the previous object's rightmost point and paints the object.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  processed = set()
  for i in range(width(I), -1, -1):
    for j in range(height(I)):
      if (j, i) in processed:
        continue
      if index(I, (j, i)) == 1:
        obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: (j, i) in toindices(o))
        new_leftmost = i if i == width(I) else max(k for k in range(i + 1, width(I) + 1) if not any(l in processed for l in toindices(shift(obj, (0, k - i)))))
        new_topmost = j + 1 if j > 0 else j
        if j == 0:
          obj = recolor(2, obj)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (new_topmost, new_leftmost - leftmost(obj))))
        processed.update(toindices(shift(obj, (new_topmost - j, new_leftmost - leftmost(obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through grid locations right-to-left and top-to-bottom, finding the rightmost available position for each object and painting it. It keeps track of processed cells to avoid overlapping.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    new_leftmost = width(I) - len(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: leftmost(o) > leftmost(obj)))
    new_topmost = uppermost(obj) + sum(height(o) for o in objects(I, T, F, T) if leftmost(o) == leftmost(obj) and uppermost(o) < uppermost(obj))
    if uppermost(obj) == 0:
      obj = recolor(2, obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (new_topmost, new_leftmost - leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version calculates the new position of each object based on:

* **new_leftmost:** The number of objects to its right.
* **new_topmost:**  The combined height of objects in the same column above it.

It then recolors the topmost object and paints the objects onto the canvas.
