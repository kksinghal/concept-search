## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The transformation involves two primary steps:

1. **Rotation and Translation:** Each object in the input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then translated. The translation vector seems to be (object's height, object's width), effectively moving the object down and right by its dimensions. 
2. **Single-Cell Addition:** A single cell with value '1' is added to the right of the top-right corner of each rotated and translated object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The transformation follows the same logic as in the Input_0 to Output_0 pair.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    new_obj = shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), width(obj)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, new_obj))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift({(1, (0, 0))}, (uppermost(new_obj), rightmost(new_obj) + 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size and background color as the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
3. **Rotation and Translation:** `toobject` converts the object's indices to an object representation. `rot90` rotates this object 90 degrees clockwise. `shift` translates the rotated object by its height and width.
4. **Painting:**  Paints the rotated and translated object onto the canvas `O` with value '1'. Then, it adds a single cell with value '1' to the right of the transformed object's top-right corner.
5. **Output:** Returns the transformed canvas `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), add((height(obj), width(obj)), ulcorner(obj)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(uppermost(obj) + height(obj), rightmost(obj) + width(obj) + 1)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but calculates the translation slightly differently. It directly adds the object's height and width to the object's upper-left corner coordinates for translation and uses set notation for the single-cell addition.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        paint(
            canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
            merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), width(obj)))), objects(I, T, F, T)))
        ),
        merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, {(uppermost(obj) + height(obj), rightmost(obj) + width(obj) + 1)}), objects(I, T, F, T)))
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested `paint` and `merge` functions to achieve the transformation in a more compact way. It first paints all rotated and translated objects and then adds the single cells in a separate `paint` operation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    transformed_obj = recolor(1, shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), width(obj))))
    O = paint(O, transformed_obj)
    corner_index = (uppermost(transformed_obj), rightmost(transformed_obj) + 1)
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {corner_index})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the transformation steps for clarity. It first calculates the transformed object, paints it onto the canvas, and then calculates and paints the additional single cell based on the transformed object's position.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge([
        recolor(1, shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), width(obj))))
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
      ] + [
        recolor(1, {(uppermost(obj) + height(obj), rightmost(obj) + width(obj) + 1)})
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
      ])
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses list comprehensions within the `merge` function to achieve a more compact and Pythonic representation. It generates lists of transformed objects and single cells and then merges them before painting onto the canvas.
