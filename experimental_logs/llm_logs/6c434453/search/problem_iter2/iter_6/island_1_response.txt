## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation rotates each object in the input grid 270 degrees counterclockwise and then places two copies of the rotated object onto a blank canvas the same size as the input grid.  

- **Copy 1:** This copy is shifted two units down and one unit to the right from its original position in the input grid.
- **Copy 2:** This copy is recolored to have a value of 1 and is shifted three units down and two units to the right from the upper-left corner of the original object in the input grid.

**Example:**

Let's consider a simple object 'X' represented by the digit '2' in the input grid:

**Input Grid:**
```
0 0 0
2 2 2
0 0 0 
```

**Output Grid:**
```
0 2 0
2 2 2
0 2 0
```

1. **Rotation:** Object 'X' is rotated 270 degrees counterclockwise.
2. **Copy 1:** The rotated 'X' is shifted two units down and one unit right.
3. **Copy 2:** The rotated 'X' is recolored to '1', then shifted three units down and two units right from the original 'X's upper-left corner.

This process is applied to all objects within the input grid to generate the output grid.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    rotated_obj = rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I))
    shifted_obj1 = shift(rotated_obj, (TWO, ONE))
    shifted_obj2 = shift(recolor(ONE, rotated_obj), add(ulcorner(toindices(obj)), (THREE, TWO)))
    O = paint(paint(O, shifted_obj1), shifted_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates an empty canvas `O` the same size as the input grid, filled with zeros.
3. **Iterate Objects:** For each object `obj` in the set `objs`:
    - **Rotate:** `rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I))` rotates the object counterclockwise by 270 degrees. 
    - **Shift Copy 1:** `shift(rotated_obj, (TWO, ONE))` shifts the rotated object two units down and one unit to the right.
    - **Shift & Recolor Copy 2:** `shift(recolor(ONE, rotated_obj), add(ulcorner(toindices(obj)), (THREE, TWO)))` recolors the rotated object to have a value of 1 and shifts it three units down and two units to the right from the upper-left corner of the original object.
    - **Paint:**  `paint(paint(O, shifted_obj1), shifted_obj2)` paints both shifted copies onto the canvas.
4. **Return Output:**  The function returns the transformed canvas `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    paint(
      canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
      merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (TWO, ONE)), objects(I, T, F, T)))
    ),
    merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), add(ulcorner(toindices(obj)), (THREE, TWO)))), objects(I, T, F, T)))
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a more functional approach, utilizing nested `paint` and `merge` functions for a more concise code structure.

1. **Canvas Initialization:**  Similar to version 1, it starts with an empty canvas.
2. **Apply Transformations:** 
    - Two `apply` functions process all objects simultaneously:
       - The first `apply` rotates and shifts each object for "Copy 1."
       - The second `apply` rotates, recolors to '1', and shifts each object for "Copy 2."
    - `merge` combines the transformed objects from both `apply` calls.
3. **Paint & Return:** Two nested `paint` calls draw the merged transformed objects onto the canvas, which is then returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
      merge([shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (TWO, ONE)) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)] + 
            [recolor(ONE, shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), add(ulcorner(toindices(obj)), (THREE, TWO)))) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)])
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version streamlines the code further by using list comprehensions within the `merge` function.

1. **Canvas and Object Extraction:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **List Comprehensions:** Two list comprehensions handle the object transformations:
   - The first comprehension generates shifted "Copy 1" objects.
   - The second comprehension generates recolored and shifted "Copy 2" objects.
3. **Merge and Paint:** The `merge` function combines both lists of transformed objects. Finally, a single `paint` call draws all transformed objects onto the canvas, which is returned.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    rotated_obj = rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I))
    return (
      shift(rotated_obj, (TWO, ONE)),
      recolor(ONE, shift(rotated_obj, add(ulcorner(toindices(obj)), (THREE, TWO))))
    )

  return paint(
    canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
    merge(apply(lambda obj: merge(transform_object(obj)), objects(I, T, F, T)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `transform_object` for better code organization and readability.

1. **`transform_object` Function:** This function encapsulates the logic for rotating, shifting, and recoloring each object. It takes an object as input and returns a tuple containing both transformed copies.
2. **Apply and Merge:** The `apply` function applies `transform_object` to each object in the input grid. `merge` then combines the resulting tuples of transformed objects into a single set.
3. **Paint and Return:** Similar to other versions, it paints the merged transformed objects onto the canvas and returns it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    transformed_objects = []
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        rotated_obj = rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I))
        shifted_obj1 = shift(rotated_obj, (TWO, ONE))
        shifted_obj2 = shift(recolor(ONE, rotated_obj), add(ulcorner(toindices(obj)), (THREE, TWO)))
        transformed_objects.extend([shifted_obj1, shifted_obj2])
    return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(transformed_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

This version explicitly iterates through the objects and accumulates the transformed objects in a list before painting them onto the canvas.

1. **Initialize `transformed_objects`:** An empty list is created to store the transformed objects.
2. **Iterate and Transform:** It iterates through each object, applies the rotation, shifting, and recoloring transformations to create two copies, and extends the `transformed_objects` list with these copies.
3. **Paint and Return:** It creates a blank canvas, merges the `transformed_objects` list, paints them onto the canvas, and returns the final canvas.


These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to accomplish the same transformation using the provided DSL, showcasing different coding styles and function combinations while achieving the same output.
