## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes all non-background objects, rotates them 90 degrees clockwise, shifts them diagonally down-right by one unit, and recolors them to 1. The original objects are left in place.

**Input 0:**

* The L-shaped object formed by '2's is rotated clockwise, shifted diagonally down-right, and recolored to '1'.

**Input 1:**

* Similar to input 0, the '2' object is rotated, shifted, and recolored.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (1, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Initializes an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Iterates through each non-background object in the input grid.
3. **`toobject(toindices(obj), I)`**: Converts the object's indices to a proper object representation using color information from the input grid.
4. **`rot90(...)`**: Rotates the object 90 degrees clockwise.
5. **`shift(..., (1, 1))`**: Shifts the rotated object diagonally down-right by one unit.
6. **`recolor(1, ...)`**: Recolors the shifted object to 1.
7. **`paint(O, ...)`**: Paints the transformed object onto the canvas.
8. **`return O`**: Returns the final transformed canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (1, 1))), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single line using functional programming concepts:

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extracts all non-background objects.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., objects(...))`**: Applies a lambda function to each extracted object.
    - The lambda function performs the rotation, shifting, and recoloring as described in version 1.
3. **`merge(...)`**: Merges the set of transformed objects into a single object.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the merged, transformed object onto a copy of the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        shifted_obj = shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1))
        transformed_obj = recolor(1, toobject(frozenset((i - 1, j + 1) for i, j in shifted_obj), rot90(I)))
        O = paint(O, transformed_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version modifies the order of operations for the transformation:

1. **Initialization and Iteration**: Similar to previous versions, it initializes an empty canvas and iterates through non-background objects.
2. **`shifted_obj = shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1))`**: Shifts the object's indices diagonally down-right by one unit.
3. **`transformed_obj = recolor(1, toobject(frozenset((i - 1, j + 1) for i, j in shifted_obj), rot90(I)))`**: This line combines multiple operations:
    - **`rot90(I)`**: Rotates the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
    - **`frozenset((i - 1, j + 1) for i, j in shifted_obj)`**: Adjusts the shifted indices to account for the rotation.
    - **`toobject(..., rot90(I))`**: Creates the transformed object by taking color values from the rotated grid at the adjusted indices.
    - **`recolor(1, ...)`**: Recolors the transformed object to 1.
4. **`O = paint(O, transformed_obj)`**: Paints the transformed object onto the canvas.
5. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, asobject(rot90(toobject(merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1)), objects(I, T, F, T))), I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version further condenses the logic by first shifting all objects and then applying rotation and recoloring:

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extracts non-background objects.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1)), objects(...))`**: Applies shifting to each object's indices.
3. **`merge(...)`**: Merges the shifted indices into a single set.
4. **`toobject(..., I)`**: Converts the merged indices to an object, using colors from the input grid.
5. **`rot90(...)`**: Rotates the combined object 90 degrees clockwise.
6. **`asobject(...)`**: Converts the rotated object back to a format suitable for painting.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the final transformed object onto a copy of the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1)), objects(I, T, F, T))
  rotated_grid = rot90(I)
  transformed_obj = recolor(1, toobject(shifted_objs, rotated_grid))
  return paint(I, transformed_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the shifting, rotation, and recoloring steps for clarity:

1. **`shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1)), objects(I, T, F, T))`**: Shifts all non-background objects diagonally down-right.
2. **`rotated_grid = rot90(I)`**: Rotates the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3. **`transformed_obj = recolor(1, toobject(shifted_objs, rotated_grid))`**:
    - Creates the transformed object by using the shifted indices and taking colors from the rotated grid.
    - Recolors the combined object to 1.
4. **`return paint(I, transformed_obj)`**: Paints the final transformed object onto a copy of the input grid.


These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version offers varying levels of conciseness and readability while achieving the same result.
