## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking each object in the input grid, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, and then painting both the rotated object and a recolored, shifted version of the original object onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Details:**

1. **Object Identification:** The program identifies each connected component of non-background pixels in the input grid as an object.
2. **Rotation:** Each object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
3. **Recoloring and Shifting:** A copy of each original object is created, its color is changed to "1," and it's shifted one pixel down and one pixel to the right.
4. **Painting:** Both the rotated object and the recolored, shifted object are painted onto a blank canvas that has the same dimensions and background color as the input grid. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = paint(O, rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toobject(toindices(obj), I), (1, 1))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a blank canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** `for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):` iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **Rotation and Painting:** 
    - `toobject(toindices(obj), I)` extracts the object from the grid.
    - `rot90(...)` rotates the extracted object 90 degrees clockwise.
    - `paint(O, ...)` paints the rotated object onto the canvas.
4. **Recoloring, Shifting, and Painting:**
    - `toobject(toindices(obj), I)` extracts the object again.
    - `shift(..., (1, 1))` shifts the object one pixel down and one pixel to the right.
    - `recolor(1, ...)` recolors the shifted object to have a value of 1.
    - `paint(O, ...)` paints the recolored, shifted object onto the canvas.
5. **Return:** The function returns the modified canvas `O`, which now contains the transformed objects.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    shifted_obj = shift(toobject(toindices(obj), I), (1, 1))
    O = underpaint(O, rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(1, shifted_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 1, but instead of using `paint`, it utilizes `underpaint`.  This ensures that only background pixels on the canvas are modified, preventing overlap issues that might arise from the shifting operation.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  rotated_objs = apply(lambda obj: rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), objects(I, T, F, T))
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, shift(toobject(toindices(obj), I), (1, 1))), objects(I, T, F, T))
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in combine(rotated_objs, shifted_objs):
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first generates two separate sets of objects: one set with rotated objects and another with recolored and shifted objects. It then combines these sets and iterates through them, painting each object onto the canvas. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(
      paint(
          canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
          mapply(lambda obj: rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), objects(I, T, F, T))
      ),
      mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, shift(toobject(toindices(obj), I), (1, 1))), objects(I, T, F, T))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested `paint` and `mapply` functions to achieve the transformation in a more compact manner. `mapply` applies the rotation and recoloring/shifting operations to all objects simultaneously and then paints them onto the canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(1, shift(toobject(toindices(obj), I), (1, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines aspects of versions 1 and 2. It uses `paint` to draw the rotated object, ensuring its visibility, while utilizing `underpaint` for the recolored and shifted object to prevent overlapping issues.
