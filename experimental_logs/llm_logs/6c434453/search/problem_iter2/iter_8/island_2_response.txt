## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve two primary operations:

1. **Rotating Objects:** Each object formed by connected digits is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. 
2. **Shifting Objects:** After rotation, the objects are shifted. The shift doesn't seem to follow a fixed pattern and likely depends on the object's position and/or shape.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '2' object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
* The rotated object is shifted one cell down and one cell to the right.
* A '1' shape appears, potentially constructed from scratch based on the '2' object's position.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '2' object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
* The rotated object is shifted two cells to the right.
* A '1' shape appears, again likely constructed based on the '2' object's relative position after rotation.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Since the exact shift logic is unclear, the following programs focus on the rotation and offer different potential approaches for shifting and '1' shape generation.

**Program Version 1:** 

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  rotated_objs = apply(rot90, objs)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 1)), rotated_objs) # Example shift - needs refinement
  painted = paint(I, merge(shifted_objs))
  # Logic to generate '1' shape based on object position - needs implementation
  return painted 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects from the grid.
2. **Rotate:** `apply(rot90, objs)` rotates each object 90 degrees clockwise.
3. **Shift:** `apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 1)), rotated_objs)` shifts each object. **This line needs adjustment** based on the actual shift logic.
4. **Paint:** `paint(I, merge(shifted_objs))` paints the shifted objects back onto the grid. 
5. **Generate '1' Shape:** **This part needs to be implemented** based on how the '1' shape's position relates to the object.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T)) # Assuming single primary object
  rotated = rot90(obj)
  center_before = centerofmass(obj)
  center_after = add(centerofmass(rotated), (1, 1)) # Example offset - needs refinement
  shift_amount = subtract(center_after, center_before)
  shifted = shift(rotated, shift_amount)
  painted = paint(I, shifted)
  # Logic to generate '1' shape based on object position - needs implementation
  return painted
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Primary Object:** Assumes a single main object and extracts it.
2. **Rotate and Calculate Shift:** Rotates the object and determines the shift needed to align the rotated object's center of mass with an offset from the original center. **The offset needs refinement**.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Shifts the rotated object and paints it onto the grid.
4. **'1' Shape Generation:**  **Requires implementation** based on the relationship between the object and the '1' shape.

**Program Version 3:** 

```python
def solve(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    rotated = rot90(obj)
    # Shift logic based on object properties (e.g., size, position) - needs implementation
    shifted = shift(rotated, (0, 0)) # Placeholder - replace with actual shift logic
    I = paint(I, shifted) 
  # Logic to generate '1' shape - needs implementation
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Rotate:**  Iterates through objects, rotating each one.
2. **Shift Based on Properties:** **Implement shift logic** based on object properties like size, uppermost/leftmost positions, etc.
3. **Paint Iteratively:** Paints each shifted object directly onto the grid within the loop.
4. **'1' Shape Generation:** **Implementation needed** for constructing the '1' shape.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    rotated = rot90(obj)
    # Calculate shift based on object's relative position to other objects
    shift_amount = (0, 0) # Placeholder - implement shift logic
    shifted_objs.add(shift(rotated, shift_amount))
  painted = paint(I, merge(shifted_objs))
  # Logic to generate '1' shape - needs implementation
  return painted
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **Calculate Shift Contextually:** For each object, calculates the shift based on its relative position to other objects on the grid. **This shift logic needs implementation**.
3. **Shift and Paint:**  Shifts the rotated objects and paints them onto the grid.
4. **'1' Shape Generation:** **Requires separate implementation** to create the '1' shape. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    rotated = rot90(obj)
    # Implement shift logic based on analysis of input-output pairs
    shifted = shift(rotated, (2, 0)) # Example - refine based on patterns
    return shifted
  transformed_grid = paint(I, merge(apply(transform_object, objects(I, T, F, T))))
  # Logic to generate '1' shape - needs implementation
  return transformed_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Transformation Function:**  Creates a function `transform_object` to encapsulate object rotation and shifting.
2. **Apply Transformation:**  Applies the `transform_object` function to each object extracted from the grid.
3. **Paint Transformed Objects:** Paints the transformed objects onto the grid.
4. **'1' Shape Generation:**  **Requires a separate implementation** to create the '1' shape based on object positions.

**Note:**  All versions lack the logic to generate the '1' shape. To complete these programs, you need to analyze the relationship between the '1' shape and the transformed object's position in the output grids and implement the corresponding code. Additionally, the shift logic needs to be refined based on the specific patterns identified in the input-output pairs.
