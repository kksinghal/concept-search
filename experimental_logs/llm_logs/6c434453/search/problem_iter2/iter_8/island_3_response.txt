## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Small Object:** The small object (3 connected cells of value '2') is rotated 180 degrees and moved to the top-left corner of the grid.
2. **Large Object:** The large object (6 connected cells of value '2') remains in the same position but is split into two parts along its diagonal. The lower triangular part is shifted one cell diagonally down and to the right. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Small Object:** The small object is rotated 180 degrees and moved to the top-right corner of the grid.
2. **Large Object:**  The large object is split into two parts along its diagonal. The lower triangular part is shifted one cell diagonally down and to the right.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Identify small and large objects
  small = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: size(o) == 3)
  large = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: size(o) == 6)
  
  # Define transformations
  transform_small = lambda obj: shift(rot180(obj), subtract((0, len(I[0]) - width(obj)), ulcorner(obj)))
  split_large = lambda obj: combine(frozenset(idx for idx in toindices(obj) if idx[0] <= idx[1]),
                                    shift(frozenset(idx for idx in toindices(obj) if idx[0] > idx[1]), (1, 1)))
  
  # Construct output
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, transform_small(small)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, split_large(large)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Object Identification:**  Extracts the small and large objects from the input grid.
2.  **Small Object Transformation:** Rotates the small object by 180 degrees and shifts it to the top-right corner using its width.
3.  **Large Object Transformation:** Splits the large object along its diagonal and shifts the lower part diagonally.
4.  **Output Construction:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the transformed objects with their respective colors.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # Define functions for object manipulation
  move_small = lambda obj: shift(rot180(obj), subtract((0, len(I[0]) - width(obj)), ulcorner(obj)))
  split_and_shift = lambda obj: combine(frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i <= j), 
                                      shift(frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i > j), (1, 1)))
  
  # Apply transformations to objects
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) == 3:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, move_small(obj)))
    elif size(obj) == 6:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, split_and_shift(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Transformation Functions:** Defines functions for moving the small object and splitting/shifting the large object.
2.  **Iterative Transformation:** Iterates through each object in the grid.
3.  **Conditional Application:** Applies the appropriate transformation based on object size.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  small_corner = ulcorner(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) == 3))
  large_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) == 6)

  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if (i, j) in shift(toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) == 3)), 
                      subtract((0, len(I[0]) - 3), small_corner)):
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})
      elif (i, j) in toindices(large_obj):
        O = paint(O, {(2 if i <= j else 0, (i, j))})
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i + (i > j), j + (i > j)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Object Locations:**  Finds the top-left corner of the small object and extracts the large object.
2.  **Iterative Painting:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3.  **Conditional Painting:** Paints the cell based on its belonging to the transformed small or large object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # Define functions for transformation
  move_to_corner = lambda obj: shift(rot180(obj), subtract((0, len(I[0]) - width(obj)), ulcorner(obj)))
  split_diagonally = lambda obj: (frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i <= j), 
                                  frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i > j))

  # Apply transformations and construct output
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) == 3:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, move_to_corner(obj)))
    elif size(obj) == 6:
      upper, lower = split_diagonally(obj)
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, upper))
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(lower, (1, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Transformation Functions:** Defines functions for moving the small object and splitting the large object diagonally.
2.  **Separate Handling of Diagonal Parts:** Splits the large object, paints the upper part directly, and shifts the lower part before painting. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  small_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 3)
  large_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 6)

  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
            recolor(1, shift(rot180(small_obj), subtract((0, len(I[0]) - width(small_obj)), ulcorner(small_obj)))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(large_obj) if i <= j)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(large_obj) if i > j), (1, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Object Extraction:**  Extracts the small and large objects from the grid.
2.  **Chained Painting:** Directly paints the transformed small object and the two parts of the large object onto a blank canvas using chaining.

These programs provide a diverse range of solutions to the transformation task. You can choose the version that best suits your needs based on factors like code readability, efficiency, and personal preference.
