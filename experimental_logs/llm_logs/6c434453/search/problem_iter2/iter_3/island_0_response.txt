## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes each object in the input grid, rotates it 90 degrees clockwise, and then paints it onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid. Subsequently, the original object is shifted diagonally down-right by one unit and painted onto the canvas again, but this time with the color '1'. 

**Input_0:** 
* The '2' object is rotated and painted.
* The '2' object is shifted down-right by one unit, recolored to '1', and painted again.

**Input_1:**
* Same logic as Input_0 applied to the '2' object.


## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    rotated_obj = rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I))
    shifted_obj = recolor(1, shift(toobject(toindices(obj), I), (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, asobject(rotated_obj)) 
    O = paint(O, shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a blank canvas (`O`) of the same size and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** `for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)` iterates through each distinct object in the input grid.
3. **Rotation:** `rotated_obj = rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I))` rotates the current object 90 degrees clockwise. 
4. **Shift and Recolor:** `shifted_obj = recolor(1, shift(toobject(toindices(obj), I), (1, 1)))` shifts the current object one unit down-right and recolors it to '1'.
5. **Painting:** `O = paint(O, asobject(rotated_obj))` and `O = paint(O, shifted_obj)` paint the rotated and shifted objects onto the canvas.
6. **Return:** `return O` returns the transformed canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, asobject(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I))))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Version 1, but directly paints the rotated object without creating an intermediate variable. 
* Uses `underpaint` for the shifted object to avoid overwriting previously painted pixels.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  rotated_objs = apply(lambda obj: asobject(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I))), objs)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, shift(toobject(toindices(obj), I), (1, 1))), objs)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in combine(rotated_objs, shifted_objs):
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Pre-computes the rotated and shifted objects using the `apply` function.
* Combines the rotated and shifted objects into a single set and then iterates through them for painting.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        paint(
            canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
            mapply(lambda obj: asobject(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I))), objects(I, T, F, T))
        ),
        mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, shift(toobject(toindices(obj), I), (1, 1))), objects(I, T, F, T))
    )
```

**Explanation:**

* Utilizes nested `paint` and `mapply` functions for a more compact representation. 
* `mapply` applies the rotation and shift/recolor operations to all objects and merges the results for painting.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = paint(O, asobject(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toobject(toindices(O), O), gravitate(obj, toobject(toindices(obj), I)))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Version 2, but instead of a fixed shift, it calculates the shift direction using `gravitate` to ensure the shifted object remains adjacent to the rotated object.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL functions. Each version leverages different function combinations and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
