## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves two main operations on the input grid:

1. **Rotating and Shifting the '2' Object:** The object composed of '2's is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and shifted one cell down and one cell right from its original position. 

2. **Adding a '1' Object:** A new object shaped like a '7' is added to the grid. The position of this object is relative to the original position of the '2' object: its top left corner is placed one cell to the right and one cell below the bottom right corner of the original '2' object. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different approaches:

**Program Version 1: Direct Approach**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Finds the '2' object, rotates and shifts it, then adds the '1' object.
    """
    obj2 = first(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))
    new_obj2 = shift(asobject(rot90(totuple(recolor(2, obj2)))), (1, 1))
    obj1_start = (ulcorner(obj2)[0], lrcorner(obj2)[1] + 1)
    obj1 = {(1, (obj1_start[0] + i, obj1_start[1] + j)) for i, j in [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2)]}
    return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_obj2), obj1)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' Object:** `obj2 = first(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))` finds the object made of '2's.
2. **Transform '2' Object:**
   - `recolor(2, obj2)` sets the color of the object to '2'.
   - `totuple(...)` converts the object to a tuple for rotation.
   - `rot90(...)` rotates the object 90 degrees clockwise.
   - `asobject(...)` converts the rotated object back to a set of cells.
   - `shift(..., (1, 1))` shifts the object one cell down and one cell right.
3. **Create '1' Object:**  `obj1 = ...` creates the '7' shaped object using set comprehension, positioning it relative to `obj2`.
4. **Paint Objects:** `paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_obj2), obj1)` paints the transformed '2' object and the new '1' object onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Program Version 2: Using Compose for Transformations**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Uses compose to chain transformations for the '2' object.
    """
    obj2 = first(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))
    transform_obj2 = compose(
        lambda x: shift(x, (1, 1)),
        lambda x: asobject(rot90(totuple(recolor(2, x))))
    )
    obj1_start = (ulcorner(obj2)[0], lrcorner(obj2)[1] + 1)
    obj1 = {(1, (obj1_start[0] + i, obj1_start[1] + j)) for i, j in [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2)]}
    return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), transform_obj2(obj2)), obj1)
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses `compose` to chain the transformations for the '2' object, making the code more concise.
- The rest of the logic remains the same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3: Looping for '7' Object Generation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Uses a loop to generate the '7' shaped object.
    """
    obj2 = first(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))
    new_obj2 = shift(asobject(rot90(totuple(recolor(2, obj2)))), (1, 1))
    obj1_start = (ulcorner(obj2)[0], lrcorner(obj2)[1] + 1)
    obj1 = set()
    for i in range(3):
      obj1.add((1, (obj1_start[0] + i, obj1_start[1])))
      obj1.add((1, (obj1_start[0] + 2 - i, obj1_start[1] + 2)))
    obj1.add((1, (obj1_start[0] + 2, obj1_start[1] + 1)))
    return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_obj2), frozenset(obj1))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses a `for` loop to generate the cells of the '7' shaped object, offering a more procedural approach.

**Program Version 4: Relative Positioning for '1' Object**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Uses relative positioning to place the '1' object.
    """
    obj2 = first(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))
    new_obj2 = shift(asobject(rot90(totuple(recolor(2, obj2)))), (1, 1))
    obj1 = shift(frozenset({(1, (i, j)) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)} - {(1, 0), (1, 2)}), (ulcorner(obj2)[0], lrcorner(obj2)[1] + 1))
    return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_obj2), obj1)
```

**Explanation:**
- This version generates the '1' object by first creating a 3x3 square of '1's and then removing the appropriate cells to form the '7' shape. This approach might be more intuitive for some users. 
- `shift` is used to position the object relative to the original '2' object.

**Program Version 5: Concatenating Pieces for '7' Object**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Constructs the '7' object by concatenating smaller pieces.
    """
    obj2 = first(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))
    new_obj2 = shift(asobject(rot90(totuple(recolor(2, obj2)))), (1, 1))
    obj1_start = (ulcorner(obj2)[0], lrcorner(obj2)[1] + 1)
    vline = {(1, (obj1_start[0] + i, obj1_start[1])) for i in range(3)}
    bottom_corner = {(1, (obj1_start[0] + 2, obj1_start[1] + 1))}
    horizontal_line = {(1, (obj1_start[0] + 2, obj1_start[1] + j)) for j in range(1, 3)}
    obj1 = vline | bottom_corner | horizontal_line 
    return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_obj2), obj1)
```

**Explanation:**

- This version constructs the '7' object by creating its constituent parts (vertical line, bottom corner, horizontal line) and then combining them using set union (`|`).
- This approach can be advantageous when dealing with more complex shapes. 

Each of these versions utilizes different DSL functions and strategies to achieve the same transformation, providing a diverse set of solutions. You can choose the version that best suits your coding style and the specific requirements of your task.
