## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking the input grids to the output grids can be described as follows:

1. **Object Identification:** The transformation identifies each connected component (object) of non-background color in the input grid. 
2. **Object Rotation:**  Each object undergoes a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
3. **Object Placement:** The rotated object is then placed in the output grid such that its top-left corner is one cell to the right of its original bottom-right corner in the input grid.
4. **Marker Placement:** A "marker" (represented by the value '1') is placed one cell to the right of the transformed object's new top-right corner.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create output canvas
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate through objects
        shifted_obj = shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1)) # Rotate and shift object
        O = paint(O, shifted_obj) # Paint shifted object to output
        marker_pos = (uppermost(shifted_obj), rightmost(shifted_obj) + 1) # Calculate marker position
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {marker_pos})) # Paint marker
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates over each object in the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`, which extracts connected components of non-background color.
3. **Transformation:**  
    - `toobject(toindices(obj), I)` converts the object's indices to an object representation.
    - `rot90(...)` rotates the object 90 degrees clockwise.
    - `shift(..., (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1))` shifts the rotated object to its desired position.
4. **Painting:** The transformed object (`shifted_obj`) is painted onto the canvas.
5. **Marker Placement:** 
    - The marker position is calculated as one cell to the right of the transformed object's top-right corner.
    - The marker is then painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = paint(O, shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(uppermost(shift(toindices(obj), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1))), rightmost(shift(toindices(obj), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1))) + 1)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines object painting and marker placement into single `paint` calls for conciseness. It directly calculates the shifted object and marker positions within the `paint` function calls.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = cover(O, obj)
        O = paint(O, shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(uppermost(shift(toindices(obj), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1))), rightmost(shift(toindices(obj), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1))) + 1)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`). It then iterates through each object, clearing the original object from `O` before painting the transformed object and marker.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    transformed_objs = [shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1)) for obj in objs]
    markers = [recolor(1, {(uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}) for obj in transformed_objs]
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs + markers))
```

**Explanation:**

This version first generates lists of transformed objects and their corresponding markers. Then, it paints all of them onto a blank canvas in a single step using `paint` and `merge`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
        merge([shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1)) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)] + 
              [recolor(1, {(uppermost(shift(toindices(obj), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1))), rightmost(shift(toindices(obj), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1))) + 1)}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version further compresses the code by merging transformed objects and markers within a single `merge` call, which is then used to paint them onto the canvas.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic flow.
