## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves rotating the objects by 90 degrees, shifting them and drawing a '1' shape based on the final position of the objects.

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Rotation:** The object (composed of '2's) is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **Shifting:** The rotated object is shifted down by a certain amount (appears to be based on its initial position).
3. **'1' Shape:**  A '1' shape is drawn, with its top aligned with the right edge of the shifted object. The length of the '1' shape's vertical line and the position of its horizontal arm seem dependent on the object's final position.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

The same logic from Input 0 to Output 0 applies, but the initial position of the object is different, leading to a different shift amount and '1' shape placement.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  rotated = rot90(togrid(obj))
  shifted = shift(toobject(rotated), (height(I)-rightmost(obj)-1, leftmost(obj)))
  painted = paint(I, shifted)
  one = shift(recolor(1, parse_grid(((3,1,1,1),(1,0,0,0),(1,0,0,0)))), (lowermost(shifted), rightmost(shifted)+1))
  return paint(painted, one)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Rotate:** Isolates the primary object, rotates it 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90`.
2. **Calculate Shift:** Determines the shift amount based on the object's initial rightmost and leftmost positions, ensuring it's placed correctly after rotation.
3. **Apply Shift:**  Shifts the rotated object using the calculated offset.
4. **Paint:**  Paints the shifted object onto the original grid.
5. **Generate and Paint '1':**  Constructs the '1' shape using `parse_grid` and positions it based on the object's final position. The '1' is then painted onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  rotated = rot90(togrid(obj))
  shifted = shift(toobject(rotated), (height(I)-rightmost(obj)-1, leftmost(obj)))
  painted = paint(I, shifted)
  one = shift(recolor(1, {(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)}), (lowermost(shifted)-3, rightmost(shifted)+1))
  return paint(painted, one)
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but uses a different approach to generate the '1' shape. It directly defines the indices for the '1' instead of using `parse_grid`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  painted = paint(I, shift(toobject(rot90(togrid(obj))), (height(I)-rightmost(obj)-1, leftmost(obj))))
  return paint(painted, shift(recolor(1, {(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)}), (lowermost(objects(painted, T, F, T)[0])-3, rightmost(objects(painted, T, F, T)[0])+1)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines the rotation, shifting, and painting of the object into a single line for conciseness. It also calculates the '1' shape's position directly from the painted grid using `objects`, making it more adaptable to potential variations.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  I = paint(I, shift(toobject(rot90(togrid(obj))), (height(I)-rightmost(obj)-1, leftmost(obj))))
  for i in range(3):
    I = paint(I, recolor(1, {(lowermost(objects(I, T, F, T)[0])-3+i, rightmost(objects(I, T, F, T)[0])+1)}))
  I = paint(I, recolor(1, {(lowermost(objects(I, T, F, T)[0]), rightmost(objects(I, T, F, T)[0])+2)}))
  I = paint(I, recolor(1, {(lowermost(objects(I, T, F, T)[0]), rightmost(objects(I, T, F, T)[0])+3)}))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

Version 4 takes a more iterative approach to drawing the '1'. It paints each cell of the '1' individually based on the object's final position. While less efficient than other versions, it demonstrates a different coding style.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  painted = paint(I, shift(toobject(rot90(togrid(obj))), (height(I)-rightmost(obj)-1, leftmost(obj))))
  one = {(lowermost(objects(painted, T, F, T)[0])-3+i, rightmost(objects(painted, T, F, T)[0])+1) for i in range(3)}
  one |= {(lowermost(objects(painted, T, F, T)[0]), rightmost(objects(painted, T, F, T)[0])+1+j) for j in range(1, 3)}
  return paint(painted, recolor(1, one))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages set comprehensions to generate the indices for the '1' shape in a compact and efficient manner. It first creates the vertical line and then adds the horizontal part, combining them into a single set before painting.


## Notes:

- The provided code assumes the DSL includes functions like `parse_grid` and `togrid` for converting between objects and grids. If these functions are not available, you can replace them with equivalent logic using the available DSL functions.
- These programs are designed based on the provided input-output examples and the assumption that the '1' shape's size and position are dependent on the object's final position. More examples might be needed to confirm and refine these rules further.
