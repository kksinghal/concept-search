## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to rotate the objects in the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise. Additionally, a new object with value '1' is introduced. This new object takes the shape of the original object but is positioned one row below and one column to the right of the original object's initial position. 

**Example:**

- **Input_0:** A single object with value '2' exists.
- **Output_0:** The object with value '2' is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. A new object with value '1' is introduced, mimicking the shape of the rotated '2' object, but shifted one row down and one column right.

**Logic:**

1. **Object Rotation:** Each object in the input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **New Object Introduction:** For each rotated object, a new object with value '1' is created, mirroring the shape of the rotated object.
3. **Position Shifting:** The new '1' objects are shifted one row down and one column right from the original position of their corresponding rotated objects.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that accomplish the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object `obj` in the input grid `I`.
3. **Rotate and Paint Original Object:** Rotate the current object `obj` 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90` and paint it onto the output grid `O`.
4. **Create and Paint New Object:** Create a new object with value '1' using `recolor` and shape identical to the original object. Shift this new object one row down and one column right using `shift` and paint it onto the output grid `O`.
5. **Return Output:** Return the transformed output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  rotated_objs = apply(lambda obj: rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), objs)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1))), objs)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in combine(rotated_objs, shifted_objs):
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Transform Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid `I`, rotate them, and create corresponding shifted objects.
2. **Combine Objects:** Combine the rotated and shifted objects into a single set.
3. **Paint Objects onto Canvas:** Create an empty canvas and paint all transformed objects onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = paint(
      paint(
          canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
          merge(apply(lambda obj: rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), objects(I, T, F, T)))
      ),
      merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1))), objects(I, T, F, T)))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested `paint` and `merge` functions to achieve the transformation in a single line of code. It first creates the canvas and then paints all rotated objects followed by painting all shifted objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(v, (j, len(I) - 1 - i))})
        O = paint(O, {(1, (j + 1, len(I) - i))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through every cell of the input grid and directly paints the rotated and shifted cells onto the output canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  rotated = rot90(I)
  shifted = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        shifted = fill(shifted, 1, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  O = cellwise(rotated, shifted, mostcolor(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the rotation and shifting operations. It first rotates the entire input grid. Then, it creates a separate grid representing the shifted positions of the new objects. Finally, it combines both grids using `cellwise` to achieve the final output.

These five program versions offer diverse solutions to the given transformation problem, showcasing different approaches and function combinations within the DSL.
