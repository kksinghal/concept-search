## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the positions of the digits '3' and '4' within the grid, while maintaining their original row positions. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 - Output_0:** The '3' at (0,0) and '4' at (2,2) are swapped, resulting in '3' at (1,1) and '4' at (2,2).
* **Input_1 - Output_1:** Similar swap occurs for '3' and '4' while staying in rows 1 and 2 respectively.
* **Input_2 - Output_2:** Same logic applied; '3' and '4' swap positions within their respective rows. 
* **Input_3 - Output_3:** '3' at (1,1) and '4' at (4,5) are swapped.
* **Input_4 - Output_4:**  Swap occurs for '3' and '4' in rows 7 and 2 respectively.
* **Input_5 - Output_5:** '3' at (2,3) and '4' at (9,3) are swapped.
* **Input_6 - Output_6:** The transformation mirrors Input_0 - Output_0.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_loc = ulcorner(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 3)))
  four_loc = ulcorner(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 4)))
  new_three_loc = (three_loc[0], four_loc[1])
  new_four_loc = (four_loc[0], three_loc[1])
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I, toobject(three_loc, I)), 
                        toobject(four_loc, I)),
                 shift(toobject(three_loc, I), 
                       subtract(new_three_loc, three_loc))),
                 shift(toobject(four_loc, I), 
                       subtract(new_four_loc, four_loc)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify key locations:**  It locates the upper-left corners of '3' and '4' objects.
2. **Calculate new locations:** Determines the new locations for '3' and '4' by swapping the column indices of their original locations. 
3. **Swap Objects:** Removes the original '3' and '4' objects and paints them at their new locations.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    three_indices = ofcolor(I, 3)
    four_indices = ofcolor(I, 4)
    O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I, three_indices), four_indices), 
                  recolor(3, shift(three_indices, (0, rightmost(four_indices) - rightmost(three_indices))))), 
                  recolor(4, shift(four_indices, (0, leftmost(three_indices) - leftmost(four_indices))))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find indices of '3' and '4':**  Identifies the indices of all occurrences of '3' and '4' in the grid.
2. **Calculate column shift:** Determines the shift required to move '3' to '4's column and vice versa.
3. **Swap and Recolor:** Removes the '3' and '4' objects and repaints them at their new locations, effectively swapping their positions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 3))
  four_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 4))
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I, three_obj), four_obj), 
                shift(three_obj, (0, centerofmass(four_obj)[1] - centerofmass(three_obj)[1]))), 
                shift(four_obj, (0, centerofmass(three_obj)[1] - centerofmass(four_obj)[1])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '3' and '4' objects:** Isolates the objects formed by '3' and '4'.
2. **Calculate horizontal shift based on center of mass:**  Determines the difference in the column indices of the center of mass for '3' and '4' objects.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Removes the original '3' and '4' objects and paints shifted versions to their new positions based on the calculated column shift.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  threes = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 3)
  fours = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 4)
  three = first(threes)
  four = first(fours)
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I, three), four), 
                 shift(three, (0, rightmost(four) - rightmost(three)))), 
                 shift(four, (0, leftmost(three) - leftmost(four))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter objects by color:**  Extracts objects composed of '3' and '4' respectively.
2. **Select first object:**  Takes the first '3' and '4' object encountered.
3. **Calculate column difference:** Determines the difference in column indices between the rightmost points of '4' and '3', and vice-versa.
4. **Shift and Paint:**  Removes the original objects and repaints shifted versions based on calculated column differences, effectively swapping '3' and '4'. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    three_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 3))
    four_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 4))
    three_shift = (0, rightmost(four_obj) - rightmost(three_obj))
    four_shift = (0, leftmost(three_obj) - leftmost(four_obj))
    O = paint(paint(I, shift(three_obj, three_shift)), shift(four_obj, four_shift))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Isolates the objects formed by '3' and '4'.
2. **Calculate individual shifts:** Determines the necessary horizontal shifts for both '3' and '4' based on their rightmost and leftmost points respectively.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Directly paints the shifted '3' and '4' objects onto the original grid, resulting in the swapped positions.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diverse application of the provided DSL.
