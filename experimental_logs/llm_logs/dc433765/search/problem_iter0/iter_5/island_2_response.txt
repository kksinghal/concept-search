## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-zero objects in the input grid to specific positions in the output grid, while maintaining their relative order and keeping everything else as the background color (0).

* **Object 3:** This object always moves to the middle column of the grid, one row above the center.
* **Object 4:** This object always stays in its original column but moves to the bottom row.

The size or shape of the objects does not affect the transformation.

## Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, False, False, True)
  new_objs = frozenset()
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for obj in objs:
    value = color(obj)
    if value == 3:
      offset = (h // 2 - uppermost(obj) - 1, w // 2 - leftmost(obj) - width(obj) // 2)
    elif value == 4:
      offset = (h - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0)
    else:
      offset = (0, 0)
    new_objs = new_objs | shift(obj, offset)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), new_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code starts by identifying all non-zero objects in the grid using `objects(grid, False, False, True)`.
2. **Iterate and Move:** It then iterates through each object:
    - **Object 3:** Calculates the offset needed to move the object to the middle column, one row above center, and uses `shift` to move it.
    - **Object 4:**  Calculates the offset to move the object to the bottom row of its original column and uses `shift`.
    - **Other Objects:** No offset is applied, effectively leaving them in their original positions.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** Finally, it creates a blank canvas using `canvas` and paints the moved objects onto it with `paint`.

## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj3 = extract(objects(grid, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  obj4 = extract(objects(grid, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  new_obj3 = shift(obj3, (h // 2 - uppermost(obj3) - 1, w // 2 - leftmost(obj3) - width(obj3) // 2))
  new_obj4 = shift(obj4, (h - uppermost(obj4) - height(obj4), 0))
  return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), new_obj3), new_obj4)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** This version directly extracts objects 3 and 4 using `extract` and a lambda function to check the color.
2. **Calculate Offsets:** It calculates the necessary offsets for moving object 3 to its target position and object 4 to the bottom row.
3. **Shift Objects:**  It then uses `shift` to move the extracted objects according to the calculated offsets.
4. **Paint Sequentially:** Finally, it creates a blank canvas with `canvas` and paints `new_obj3` followed by `new_obj4` onto it. 

## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  obj3 = recolor(0, extract(objects(grid, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3))
  obj4 = recolor(0, extract(objects(grid, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 4))
  grid = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), shift(obj3, (h // 2 - uppermost(obj3) - 1, w // 2 - leftmost(obj3) - width(obj3) // 2))), shift(obj4, (h - uppermost(obj4) - height(obj4), 0)))
  return replace(replace(grid, 0, 3), 0, 4)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Recolor:** This version extracts objects 3 and 4, but instead of moving them directly, it recolors them to the background color (0) using `recolor`.
2. **Paint on Canvas:** It then paints these "invisible" objects at their target positions on a blank canvas created by `canvas`. 
3. **Replace Colors:** Finally, it uses two calls to `replace` to first change all remaining 0s to 3 and then any remaining 0s to 4, effectively restoring the objects' original colors at their new positions.

## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  objs = objects(grid, False, False, True)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 3:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(3, (h // 2 - 1, w // 2))})
      elif value == 4:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(4, (h - 1, j))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Grid:** This version iterates directly through each cell of the grid.
2. **Identify and Paint:** If the cell value is 3, it paints a single-cell object of color 3 at its target location on a new canvas. If the cell value is 4, it paints a single-cell object of color 4 at the bottom of its current column.
3. **Return New Grid:** The function returns the newly constructed `new_grid` with the objects in their transformed positions.

## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(j == w // 2 and i == h // 2 - 1, 3, branch(i == h - 1, 4, 0))
      for j in range(w)
    ) for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Loops with Branching:** This version uses nested loops to iterate over each cell's coordinates (i, j).
2. **Conditional Painting:** For each cell, it uses nested `branch` functions to conditionally determine the cell's value:
    - If the cell is in the target position for 3, it assigns a value of 3.
    - If the cell is in the bottom row, it assigns a value of 4.
    - Otherwise, it assigns a value of 0 (background).

This approach constructs the output grid cell-by-cell based on the target positions.
