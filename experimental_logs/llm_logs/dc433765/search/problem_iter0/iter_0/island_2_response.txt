## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all input-output pairs seems to center the non-zero objects within their respective rows while preserving the relative order of the objects.

**Example:**

**Input_0:**
```
3 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 4 
```

**Output_0:**
```
0 0 0
0 3 0
0 0 4
```

Here, '3' and '4' are centered in their respective rows in the output.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, False, False, True)
  new_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    i = uppermost(obj)
    width_obj = width(obj)
    offset = (0, len(grid[0]) // 2 - width_obj // 2)
    new_objs = new_objs | shift(obj, offset)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), new_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(grid, False, False, True)` identifies all distinct non-background objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and center:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`), calculates the required horizontal shift to center it (`offset`), shifts the object (`shift(obj, offset)`), and adds it to the `new_objs` set.
3. **Paint on canvas:** Finally, it creates a blank canvas (`canvas(0, shape(grid))`) and paints the centered objects (`paint`) to generate the output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          0 if j != len(row) // 2 - row.count(c) // 2 + i 
          else c for i, c in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and cells:** This version iterates through each row and each cell within the row.
2. **Calculate center position:** For each cell containing a non-zero value (`c`), it calculates the center position (`len(row) // 2 - row.count(c) // 2 + i`) for that value in the row.
3. **Conditional placement:** If the current cell's index matches the calculated center position, the non-zero value is placed; otherwise, a '0' is placed.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          v if (i, j) == (i, len(r) // 2 - r.count(v) // 2 + r.index(v)) else 0 
          for j, v in enumerate(r)
      )
      for i, r in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and identify non-zero cells:**  The code iterates through rows and cells, identifying cells with non-zero values (`v`).
2. **Calculate target index:** For each non-zero cell, it calculates the target index (`len(r) // 2 - r.count(v) // 2 + r.index(v)`), representing the center position for that value in the row.
3. **Conditional placement:** If the current cell's index matches the target index, the non-zero value (`v`) is retained; otherwise, it's replaced by '0'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(grid):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            c if (i, j) in {(i, k) for k in range(len(row) // 2 - row.count(c) // 2, len(row) // 2 - row.count(c) // 2 + row.count(c))} else 0
            for j, c in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(grid)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and identify non-zero cell ranges:** The code iterates through rows and cells, identifying the range of indices (`{(i, k) ...}`) where a non-zero value should be placed to achieve centering.
2. **Conditional placement:**  If the current cell's index falls within the calculated range for its corresponding non-zero value, the value is retained; otherwise, it's replaced by '0'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != 0:
        new_j = len(row) // 2 - row.count(value) // 2 + row.index(value)
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(value, (i, new_j))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:**  A new grid (`new_grid`) is created, filled with '0's and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate and find target positions:** The code iterates through the input grid, identifying non-zero cells and calculating their target positions (`new_j`) in their respective rows.
3. **Paint on canvas:** For each non-zero cell, it paints the value at the calculated target position on the new grid.

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same centering transformation using the DSL functions. Each version highlights a distinct way of manipulating and placing objects within the grid.
