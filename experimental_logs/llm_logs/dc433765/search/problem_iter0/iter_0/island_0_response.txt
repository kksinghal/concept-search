## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently repositions the objects represented by the digits 3 and 4 within the grid. 

* **3 moves to the center of the grid's bottom row.**
* **4 moves to the center of the grid's rightmost column.**

The positions are determined relative to the actual grid dimensions, not just the occupied cells.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  threes = colorfilter(objs, 3)
  fours = colorfilter(objs, 4)
  three = first(threes)
  four = first(fours)
  new_three_loc = (height(I)-1, width(I)//2)
  new_four_loc = (height(I)//2, width(I)-1)
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I, three), four), shift(three, subtract(new_three_loc, ulcorner(three)))), shift(four, subtract(new_four_loc, ulcorner(four))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  Finds all objects in the grid (connected areas of the same color).
2. **Filter by color:**  Isolates objects formed by the digits 3 and 4.
3. **Extract objects:** Takes the first (and assumed only) occurrence of 3 and 4.
4. **Calculate new positions:** Determines the target locations for 3 and 4 based on grid dimensions.
5. **Move objects:**  Covers the original 3 and 4, then paints them back at the calculated positions.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  three_loc = ulcorner(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 3)))
  four_loc =  ulcorner(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 4)))
  target_three = (height(I) - 1, width(I) // 2)
  target_four = (height(I) // 2, width(I) - 1)
  O = move(move(I, toobject(three_loc, I), subtract(target_three, three_loc)), toobject(four_loc, I), subtract(target_four, four_loc))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate 3 and 4:** Finds the upper-left corner indices of 3 and 4.
2. **Calculate targets:**  Determines the target locations like in Version 1.
3. **Move using offsets:** Uses the `move` function to directly shift the objects by calculating the difference between their current and target positions.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  three = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  four = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  new_I = cover(cover(I, three), four)
  center_bottom = (height(I)-1, width(I)//2)
  center_right = (height(I)//2, width(I)-1)
  O = paint(paint(new_I, shift(three, subtract(center_bottom, ulcorner(three)))), shift(four, subtract(center_right, ulcorner(four))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object identification and filtering:** Similar to Version 1, identifies objects and filters for 3 and 4.
2. **Clear original positions:** Removes the original 3 and 4 objects, creating a blank canvas.
3. **Calculate targets:** Determines target locations.
4. **Paint at new positions:** Paints the 3 and 4 objects at the calculated target locations.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  threes = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 3)
  fours = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 4)
  bottom_center = (height(I) - 1, width(I) // 2)
  right_center = (height(I) // 2, width(I) - 1)
  moved_threes = apply(lambda x: shift(x, subtract(bottom_center, ulcorner(x))), threes)
  moved_fours = apply(lambda x: shift(x, subtract(right_center, ulcorner(x))), fours)
  O = paint(paint(I, merge(moved_threes)), merge(moved_fours))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find and filter:**  Similar to previous versions, finds and filters objects for 3 and 4.
2. **Calculate target locations:**  Determines the center bottom and center right locations.
3. **Shift objects:** Calculates the shift offset for each object and applies it using `apply` and `shift`.
4. **Paint shifted objects:** Paints the shifted objects onto the original grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  def move_to_target(obj, target):
    return shift(obj, subtract(target, ulcorner(obj)))
  three = move_to_target(extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 3), (height(I) - 1, width(I) // 2))
  four = move_to_target(extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 4), (height(I) // 2, width(I) - 1))
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I, three), four), three), four)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object identification and filtering:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **`move_to_target` function:**  Defines a reusable function to calculate the shift offset and apply it to an object.
3. **Apply movement:** Uses `move_to_target` to move both 3 and 4 to their respective target locations.
4. **Paint moved objects:** Clears the original locations and paints the objects at their new positions.
