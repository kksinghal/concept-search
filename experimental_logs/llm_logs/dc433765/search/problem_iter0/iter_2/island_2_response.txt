## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers the non-zero elements of each row individually in the grid while maintaining their relative order. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The '3' and '4' are centered in their respective rows.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the '3' and '4' are centered in their row.
* **Input_2 - Input_5:**  The pattern continues for larger grids, with the non-zero elements '3' and '4' always centered in their respective rows.
* **Input_6:**  This example highlights that the centering is done on a per-row basis, as the '4' is now centered in the bottom row independently of the '3' in the top row.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          v if (i, j) == (i, len(r) // 2 - r.count(v) // 2 + r.index(v)) else 0 
          for j, v in enumerate(r)
      )
      for i, r in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row and identifies the non-zero elements. It then calculates the padding needed on either side to center the non-zero elements and reconstructs the row with the calculated padding.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(0 if v == 0 else v if j == len(r) // 2 - r.count(v) // 2 + r.index(v) else 0 for j, v in enumerate(r))
    for i, r in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more compact conditional expression within the list comprehension. It iterates through each row and places a non-zero element 'v' only at the calculated center position for that row; otherwise, it fills the cell with a zero.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    return tuple(tuple(b if b == a else 0 for a, b in zip(r, [0] * (len(r) // 2 - len([x for x in r if x != 0]) // 2) + [x for x in r if x != 0] + [0] * (len(r) // 2 - len([x for x in r if x != 0]) // 2))) for r in grid)
```

**Explanation:** 

This version constructs the centered row by first extracting non-zero elements, then calculating the necessary padding, and finally combining padding, non-zero elements, and padding again. It then uses `zip` to compare this constructed row with the original, placing the original element only if it matches its position in the centered row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(v if i == len(r) // 2 - len([x for x in r if x != 0]) // 2 + [n for n, x in enumerate(r) if x != 0].index(i) else 0 for i, v in enumerate(r))
      for r in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly calculates the centered position for each element within the list comprehension. It checks if the current index 'i' matches the calculated centered position. If they match, it retains the original element 'v'; otherwise, it places a zero.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(0 if not any(r) else v if j == (len(r) - len([x for x in r if x != 0])) // 2 + [i for i, x in enumerate(r) if x != 0].index(j) else 0 for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version adds a check for empty rows (all zeros) at the beginning of each row processing. If a row is empty, it fills the entire row with zeros. Otherwise, it proceeds with the centering logic similar to version 4, calculating the centered position for each element and placing the original element 'v' only if its index 'j' matches the calculated position. 

Each version utilizes different combinations of DSL functions and logical flow, resulting in distinct code structures to achieve the same row-wise centering transformation.
