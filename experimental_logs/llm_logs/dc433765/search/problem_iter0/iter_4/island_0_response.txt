## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves swapping the positions of the digits '3' and '4' in the input grid while maintaining their original row positions.

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 0
3 0 4
0 0 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 0
0 3 4
0 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_loc = ulcorner(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 3)))
  four_loc = ulcorner(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 4)))
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I, toobject(three_loc, I)), 
                        toobject(four_loc, I)),
                 recolor(3, shift(toobject(three_loc, I), (0, four_loc[1]-three_loc[1])))), 
                 recolor(4, shift(toobject(four_loc, I), (0, three_loc[1]-four_loc[1]))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object Locations:**  Find the upper-left corner locations of the '3' object (`three_loc`) and the '4' object (`four_loc`).
2. **Cover Existing Objects:** Remove the existing '3' and '4' objects from the grid.
3. **Shift and Recolor:** 
    * Shift the '3' object horizontally to the column of the '4' object.
    * Shift the '4' object horizontally to the column of the '3' object.
4. **Paint New Objects:** Paint the shifted and recolored objects back onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_indices = ofcolor(I, 3)
  four_indices = ofcolor(I, 4)
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I, three_indices), four_indices),
                  recolor(3, {(3, (i, j + rightmost(four_indices) - rightmost(three_indices))) 
                              for (i, j) in three_indices})),
                  recolor(4, {(4, (i, j + leftmost(three_indices) - leftmost(four_indices))) 
                              for (i, j) in four_indices}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Object Indices:** Find the indices of all cells containing '3' (`three_indices`) and '4' (`four_indices`).
2. **Cover Existing Objects:** Clear the grid of existing '3' and '4' objects.
3. **Calculate Offsets:** Determine the horizontal offset between the '3' and '4' objects.
4. **Shift and Recolor:** 
    * Create new sets of object cells with updated indices based on the calculated offsets.
    * Recolor these new cells to maintain their original values.
5. **Paint New Objects:** Paint the shifted and recolored objects onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    three_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 3))
    four_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 4))
    three_col = leftmost(three_obj)
    four_col = leftmost(four_obj)
    O = paint(paint(I, shift(three_obj, (0, four_col - three_col))), 
                 shift(four_obj, (0, three_col - four_col)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Extract the '3' object (`three_obj`) and the '4' object (`four_obj`) from the grid.
2. **Get Column Indices:** Find the column index of the leftmost cell for both objects.
3. **Calculate Offsets:** Determine the horizontal offset between the objects based on their column positions.
4. **Shift Objects:** 
    * Shift the '3' object horizontally to the column of the '4' object.
    * Shift the '4' object horizontally to the column of the '3' object.
5. **Paint Objects:** Paint the shifted objects onto the original grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 3))
  four_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), matcher(color, 4))
  O = paint(
      paint(cover(I, three_obj), recolor(3, shift(three_obj, tojvec(rightmost(four_obj) - rightmost(three_obj))))),
      recolor(4, shift(four_obj, tojvec(leftmost(three_obj) - leftmost(four_obj))))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract the objects with color '3' and '4' from the input grid.
2. **Calculate Offsets:** Determine the horizontal offset between the rightmost points of the '3' and '4' objects, and vice-versa.
3. **Shift and Recolor:** 
    * Shift the '3' object rightward by the calculated offset using `tojvec` to create a horizontal vector representing the shift.
    * Recolor the shifted object back to '3' using `recolor`.
    * Similarly, shift the '4' object leftward and recolor it back to '4'.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the shifted and recolored objects onto the grid, effectively swapping their positions while maintaining their row positions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    three_indices = ofcolor(I, 3)
    four_indices = ofcolor(I, 4)
    three_shift = (0, ulcorner(four_indices)[1] - ulcorner(three_indices)[1])
    four_shift = (0, ulcorner(three_indices)[1] - ulcorner(four_indices)[1])
    O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I, three_indices), four_indices),
                  recolor(3, shift(three_indices, three_shift))),
                  recolor(4, shift(four_indices, four_shift)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Object Indices:** Get the indices of all cells with color '3' and '4'.
2. **Calculate Shift Vectors:** Calculate the shift vectors for both '3' and '4' based on the difference in their upper-left corner column positions.
3. **Cover and Recolor:**
    * Cover the original positions of '3' and '4' using `cover`.
    * Shift the `three_indices` and `four_indices` by their respective shift vectors using `shift`.
    * Recolor the shifted indices back to their original colors using `recolor`.
4. **Paint Shifted Objects:** Paint the shifted and recolored indices back onto the grid.

These five versions showcase different approaches and function combinations within the DSL to achieve the same transformation. Each version offers a unique perspective on how to approach and solve the problem.
