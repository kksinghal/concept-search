## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers non-background objects horizontally within their respective rows while preserving their relative order. 

**Example:**

**Input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 4
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

**Output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 4
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Here, both the '3' and '4' objects are individually centered in their rows. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      index(I, (i, j + len(row) // 2 - centerofmass(toobject(obj, I))[1]))
      if 0 <= j + len(row) // 2 - centerofmass(toobject(obj, I))[1] < len(row)
      else 0
      for j in range(len(row))
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, T) 
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** The code first identifies individual non-background objects using `objects(I, F, F, T)`. 
2. **Center Calculation:** For each object, its center of mass is calculated using `centerofmass(toobject(obj, I))`. Note that `toobject` is necessary to convert the object indices to an object with actual values from the grid.
3. **Horizontal Shifting:** The object is then shifted horizontally to be centered within its row. This is done by calculating the difference between the column index of the object's center of mass and the center column of the row.
4. **Grid Reconstruction:**  The shifted objects are then placed back onto a blank grid of the same dimensions as the input.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      v
      if (i, j) in shift(normalize(toobject(obj, I)), (i, len(I[0]) // 2 - width(obj) // 2))
      else 0
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, T) 
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration and Normalization:** Similar to version 1, the code iterates through non-background objects using `objects`. Each object is then normalized using `normalize(toobject(obj, I))` to bring its top-left corner to the origin.
2. **Centering Calculation:** The code then calculates the horizontal shift required to center the object based on its width and the width of the grid. 
3. **Shifting and Placement:** The object is shifted horizontally using `shift` and placed onto a blank grid using a conditional statement within the nested loop.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      next((v for v, (a, b) in shift(toobject(obj, I), (0, len(row) // 2 - centerofmass(toobject(obj, I))[1])) if a == i and b == j), 0) 
      for j in range(len(row))
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object-wise Processing:** This version also iterates through non-background objects and calculates the horizontal shift needed for centering. 
2. **Shifted Object Creation:** Instead of directly modifying the grid, this version creates a new shifted object using `shift` and the calculated shift amount. 
3. **Value Lookup:** The code then iterates through the grid cells and checks if the current cell's index exists within the shifted object. If found, it retrieves the corresponding value from the shifted object; otherwise, it defaults to '0'.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      index(I, (i, c + len(I[0]) // 2 - width(toobject(obj, I)) // 2))
      if (i, c) in toindices(obj) 
      else 0
      for c in range(len(row))
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects and Cells:** The code iterates through each non-background object and its corresponding cells.
2. **Calculate Horizontal Shift:** For each cell belonging to an object, the code determines the necessary shift to center the object horizontally based on the object's width and the grid's width.
3. **Retrieve Value from Input:** It then uses the `index` function to directly retrieve the value from the original input grid at the calculated new location after shifting.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            next((val for val, (k, l) in shift(obj, (0, len(I[0]) // 2 - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))) if (k, l) == (i, j)), 0) 
            for j in range(len(I[0]))
        )
        for i in range(len(I))
        for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object-Centric Iteration:** This version iterates through each non-background object in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Centering Shift:** It determines the horizontal shift required to center the object based on its leftmost point and width.
3. **Shift the Object:** The object is shifted using the `shift` function and the calculated shift amount.
4. **Value Retrieval:** The code then looks for the value at the corresponding location in the shifted object; if found, it uses that value, otherwise defaults to '0'. 

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing a range of programming styles and logic.
