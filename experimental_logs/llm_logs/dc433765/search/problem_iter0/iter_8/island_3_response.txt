## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves swapping the positions of the digits '3' and '4' in the input grid while maintaining their original column positions. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  threes = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  fours = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  O = fill(fill(I, ZERO, threes), ZERO, fours)
  O = fill(O, THREE, fours)
  O = fill(O, FOUR, threes)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target digits:**  We find the indices of digits '3' (`threes`) and '4' (`fours`) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Clear target digits:** We fill the locations of '3' and '4' with '0' to clear them from the grid.
3. **Swap and fill:**  We fill the original locations of '4' with '3' and vice versa, effectively swapping their positions.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == THREE)
  four_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  O = paint(cover(I, three_obj), recolor(THREE, four_obj))
  O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, three_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:**  We extract the objects representing digits '3' (`three_obj`) and '4' (`four_obj`) from the grid.
2. **Clear and paint:** We cover the '3' object with background color and paint the '4' object at the '3' object's location with color '3'. Then, we paint the '3' object at the '4' object's location with color '4'. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_indices = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  four_indices = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if (i,j) in three_indices:
        O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i,j)})
      if (i,j) in four_indices:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get indices:** We get the indices of '3' (`three_indices`) and '4' (`four_indices`).
2. **Iterate and swap:** We iterate through the grid, and for each cell, we check if it belongs to `three_indices` or `four_indices`. If it does, we replace its value with '4' or '3' respectively.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_loc = ulcorner(ofcolor(I, THREE))
  four_loc = ulcorner(ofcolor(I, FOUR))
  O = fill(I, ZERO, {three_loc})
  O = fill(O, THREE, {four_loc})
  O = fill(O, FOUR, {three_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find upper-left corners:**  We get the indices of the upper-left corners of the objects representing digits '3' (`three_loc`) and '4' (`four_loc`).
2. **Swap using corners:** We assume the objects consist of single cells and swap the values at these corners, effectively swapping the digits.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_obj = extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == THREE)
  four_obj = extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  O = paint(cover(I, three_obj), recolor(THREE, four_obj))
  O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, three_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition and extract:**  We partition the grid into objects based on color and extract the objects containing digits '3' (`three_obj`) and '4' (`four_obj`).
2. **Clear and paint:**  We cover the '3' object with background color and paint the '4' object at the '3' object's location with color '3'. Then, we paint the '3' object at the '4' object's location with color '4'.
