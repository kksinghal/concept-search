## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers non-background objects vertically within their respective columns. Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

* **Input 0:** The '3' and '4' are centered within their columns while maintaining their relative horizontal positions.
* **Input 1 - 6:**  The pattern continues â€“ each non-zero digit is vertically centered within its column. The relative positions of the digits within the grid are preserved. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_c444b776(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, ((height(I) - height(obj)) // 2 - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, False, False, True)` identifies all non-background connected components (objects) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Create Empty Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` generates an empty grid `O` of the same size as the input, filled with zeros (representing the background).
3. **Iterate and Center:** The code iterates through each identified object `obj`. For each object, it calculates the vertical offset required to center it within its column and uses `shift(obj, (offset, 0))` to reposition the object. The `paint` function then draws the centered object onto the canvas `O`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_c444b776(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, ((height(I) - height(obj)) // 2 - uppermost(obj), 0)) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic of version 1 into a single line. It directly paints the merged set of centered objects onto the canvas. The centering logic for each object remains the same as in version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_c444b776(I):
  return tuple(tuple(0 if j != col_idx else I[((height(I) - height(objects(crop(I,(0,j),(height(I),1)),False,False,True).pop()))//2) + k][j] 
                  for j in range(width(I))) for k, row in enumerate(canvas(0, shape(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version processes the grid column by column. It iterates through each column and calculates the vertical position to place the digit from the corresponding column in the input grid to achieve vertical centering.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_c444b776(I):
  return tuple(tuple(branch(j == center(obj)[1], I[center((0, j), shape(I))[0]][j], 0) for j in range(width(I))) 
                for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) for i in range(height(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `center` function to determine the central row index for each object and uses that information to place the digit from the input onto the output grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_c444b776(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  centered_objs = {shift(obj, ((height(I) - height(obj)) // 2 - uppermost(obj), 0)) for obj in objs}
  return tuple(tuple(next((v for (v, (row, col)) in obj if row == i and col == j), 0) 
                  for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Center Objects:** Similar to previous versions, it centers each object vertically.
2. **Iterate and Extract:**  The code iterates over each cell of the output grid. For each cell, it checks if a centered object occupies that cell. If so, it extracts the corresponding value from the object; otherwise, it defaults to 0.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
