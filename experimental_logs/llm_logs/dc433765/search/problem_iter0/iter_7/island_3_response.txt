## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as **moving all non-zero digits to the middle column while maintaining their relative order.** The background (digit '0') remains unchanged.

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:** 
    * Digit '3' moves to the middle column of its row.
    * Digit '4' moves to the middle column of its row.
* **Input_1:**
    * Digits '3' and '4' both move to the middle column of the grid, maintaining their original vertical order. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = width(I) // 2
  return tuple(
    tuple(next((v for v in row if v != 0), 0) if j == c else 0 for j in range(len(row)))
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`c = width(I) // 2`**: Calculates the middle column index (`c`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Outer loop**: Iterates through each row of the input grid.
3. **Inner loop**: Iterates through each cell in the current row.
4. **`next((v for v in row if v != 0), 0)`**:  Finds the first non-zero digit (`v`) in the row, or defaults to 0 if no non-zero digit is found.
5. **Conditional**: 
    * If the current cell index (`j`) is the middle column (`j == c`), the non-zero digit (or 0 if none) is placed in that cell.
    * Otherwise, the cell is filled with a '0'.

This program effectively moves the first non-zero digit of each row to the middle column.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = width(I) // 2
  return tuple(
    tuple(v if j == c and v != 0 else 0 for j, v in enumerate(row))
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`c = width(I) // 2`**: Calculates the middle column index.
2. **Outer loop**: Iterates through each row.
3. **Inner loop**: Iterates through each cell with its value.
4. **Conditional**:
    * If the current cell is in the middle column (`j == c`) and its value is not zero (`v != 0`), the value is kept.
    * Otherwise, the cell is filled with a '0'.

This version directly checks for non-zero values in the middle column and replaces other cells with zeros.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = width(I) // 2
  return tuple(
    tuple(0 if j != c else max(row) if sum(row) > 0 else 0 for j in range(len(row)))
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`c = width(I) // 2`**: Calculates the middle column index.
2. **Outer loop**: Iterates through each row.
3. **Inner loop**: Iterates through each cell index in the row.
4. **Conditional**:
    * If the current cell is not in the middle column (`j != c`), it is filled with a '0'.
    * If the current cell is in the middle column, it checks:
        * `sum(row) > 0`: If the row contains at least one non-zero value.
        * `max(row)`: If true, places the maximum value of the row in the middle column.
        * If false, fills with a '0'.

This version places the maximum value of each row in the middle column only if there's at least one non-zero value in the row.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  c = width(I) // 2
  return tuple(
      tuple(next((v for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == c), 0) if any(j == c for _, (i, j) in obj) else 0 for j in range(width(I)))
      for obj in objs
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`**: Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **`c = width(I) // 2`**: Calculates the middle column index.
3. **Outer loop**: Iterates through each object.
4. **Inner loop**: Iterates through each column index (`j`).
5. **`next((v for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == c), 0)`**: Finds the value of the object cell located at the middle column (`j == c`), or defaults to 0 if no such cell exists.
6. **`any(j == c for _, (i, j) in obj)`**: Checks if the object has a cell in the middle column.
7. **Conditional**: 
    * If the object has a cell in the middle column, the value of that cell is placed in the middle column of the output grid.
    * Otherwise, the cell is filled with a '0'.

This version leverages object recognition to move the objects to the middle column.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = width(I) // 2
  return tuple(
      tuple(n if i == c else 0 for i in range(width(I))) 
      for n in (next((v for v in row if v != 0), 0) for row in I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`c = width(I) // 2`**: Calculates the middle column index.
2. **Outer loop**: Iterates through non-zero values in each row using a generator expression: `(next((v for v in row if v != 0), 0) for row in I)`.
3. **Inner loop**: For each non-zero value (`n`), it creates a row filled with '0's except for the middle column (`i == c`), where it places the non-zero value.

This version uses generator expressions and nested loops to concisely move the first non-zero value of each row to the middle column.
