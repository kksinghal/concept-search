## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves swapping the positions of the objects represented by the digits '3' and '4' while maintaining their original shapes. The background remains unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj3 = first(colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), THREE))
  obj4 = first(colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), FOUR))
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I,obj3),obj4), shift(obj3, gravitate(obj3, obj4))), shift(obj4, gravitate(obj4, obj3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), THREE)` and `colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), FOUR)` identify objects composed of '3's and '4's respectively. `first` extracts the first (and assumedly only) such object.
2. **Remove Objects:** `cover(I,obj3)` and `cover(...,obj4)` remove both objects from the input grid, replacing them with the background color.
3. **Calculate New Positions:** `gravitate(obj3, obj4)` calculates the direction and magnitude to move '3' to be adjacent to '4'. The opposite is done for '4' using `gravitate(obj4, obj3)`.
4. **Shift Objects:** `shift(obj3, ...)` and `shift(obj4, ...)` move the objects to their new positions based on the calculated gravitation.
5. **Paint Objects:** `paint(..., ...)` sequentially adds the shifted '3' and '4' objects back onto the cleared grid, effectively swapping their positions.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj3 = first(colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), THREE))
  obj4 = first(colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), FOUR))
  pos3 = ulcorner(obj3)
  pos4 = ulcorner(obj4)
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I,obj3),obj4),recolor(FOUR, shift(obj3, subtract(pos4, pos3)))),recolor(THREE, shift(obj4, subtract(pos3, pos4))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, identifies the '3' and '4' objects.
2. **Get Upper-left Corners:** `ulcorner(obj3)` and `ulcorner(obj4)` find the upper-left corner coordinates of both objects.
3. **Calculate Offset:**  `subtract(pos4, pos3)` calculates the offset needed to move the '3' object to the '4' object's position, and vice versa.
4. **Shift and Recolor:** `shift` moves each object by the calculated offset.  `recolor` changes the '3' object to '4' and the '4' object to '3'.
5. **Paint Objects:** Similar to Version 1, sequentially adds the modified objects back onto the cleared grid, resulting in a swap.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj3 = extract(objects(I,T,F,F), lambda obj: color(obj) == THREE)
  obj4 = extract(objects(I,T,F,F), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  pos3 = centerofmass(obj3)
  pos4 = centerofmass(obj4)
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I,obj3),obj4),recolor(FOUR, shift(obj3, subtract(pos4, pos3)))),recolor(THREE, shift(obj4, subtract(pos3, pos4))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 2, but instead of using `ulcorner` to determine the position for the swap, it uses `centerofmass` which calculates the center of mass for each object. This approach might be beneficial if the objects are not always aligned to a corner.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj3 = first(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda x: color(x) == THREE))
  obj4 = first(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda x: color(x) == FOUR))
  temp = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(paint(temp, shift(obj4, gravitate(obj4, obj3))), shift(obj3, gravitate(obj3, obj4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the objects '3' and '4' similar to previous versions. Then it creates a blank canvas `temp` of the same size as the input grid. It then calculates the gravitation of '4' towards '3' and '3' towards '4' and shifts them accordingly. Finally, it paints the shifted objects onto the blank canvas 'temp' resulting in the swapped output.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  three_indices = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  four_indices = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  O = fill(fill(I, ZERO, three_indices), FOUR, three_indices)
  O = fill(fill(O, ZERO, four_indices), THREE, four_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly manipulates the grid based on color indices. First, it identifies the indices of '3' and '4'. Then, it fills the '3' indices with '0' (effectively erasing them) and then refills those indices with '4'. It repeats the same process for '4' indices, filling them with '0' and then with '3'. This approach avoids explicit object manipulation and relies on index-based modification for the swap.
