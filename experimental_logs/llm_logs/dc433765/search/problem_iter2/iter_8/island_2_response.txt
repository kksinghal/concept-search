## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with colors 3 and 4, then moving them to specific positions on the grid while maintaining their color. The target position for the object with color 3 is always the center of the grid. The target position for the object with color 4 is slightly offset from the center, shifting one position to the right if the grid height is even.

**Example:**

**Input_0:**

```
0 3 0
0 0 0
0 4 0 
```

**Output_0:**

```
0 0 0
0 3 0
0 0 4
```

Here, the object with color 3 is moved to the center of the grid. The object with color 4 is also moved to the center horizontally but shifted one row down because the grid height is even.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj3 = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == THREE)
  obj4 = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  h, w = shape(I)
  target3 = (h // 2, w // 2)
  target4 = (h // 2 + (h % 2), w // 2)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), 
                  shift(obj3, subtract(target3, centerofmass(obj3)))),
            shift(obj4, subtract(target4, centerofmass(obj4))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract the objects containing colors 3 (`obj3`) and 4 (`obj4`) from the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Targets:** Determine the target positions (`target3`, `target4`) for objects 3 and 4 based on the grid dimensions.
3. **Create Canvas:** Generate a blank canvas (`canvas`) of the same size as the input grid filled with zeros.
4. **Shift and Paint:** Shift both objects to their respective target locations by calculating the difference between the target and their center of mass. Paint the shifted objects onto the canvas.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices3 = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  indices4 = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  h, w = shape(I)
  target3 = (h // 2, w // 2)
  target4 = (h // 2 + (h % 2), w // 2)
  O = fill(fill(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), THREE, 
                shift(indices3, subtract(target3, centerofmass(indices3)))),
           FOUR, shift(indices4, subtract(target4, centerofmass(indices4))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Indices:** Find the indices of cells with color 3 (`indices3`) and 4 (`indices4`) in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Targets:** Determine the target positions (`target3`, `target4`) as in Version 1.
3. **Create Canvas:** Create a blank canvas as in Version 1.
4. **Shift and Fill:**  Shift the indices of both colors to their target locations. Fill the canvas with the respective colors at the shifted indices.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj3 = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == THREE)
  obj4 = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), 
                  shift(obj3, ((h // 2) - uppermost(obj3), (w // 2) - leftmost(obj3)))),
              shift(obj4, ((h // 2 + (h % 2)) - uppermost(obj4), (w // 2) - leftmost(obj4))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract objects as in Version 1.
2. **Calculate Offsets:** Calculate the shift offset directly using the difference between target coordinates and the upper-left corner of each object.
3. **Create Canvas:** Create a blank canvas as in Version 1.
4. **Shift and Paint:** Shift objects using the calculated offsets and paint them onto the canvas.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj3 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), THREE))
  obj4 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FOUR))
  h, w = shape(I)
  target3 = (h // 2, w // 2)
  target4 = (h // 2 + (h % 2), w // 2)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), 
                  recolor(THREE, shift(toindices(obj3), subtract(target3, centerofmass(obj3))))),
            recolor(FOUR, shift(toindices(obj4), subtract(target4, centerofmass(obj4)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter and Extract:** Filter objects by color and extract the first object for each color.
2. **Calculate Targets:** Calculate target positions as in Version 1.
3. **Create Canvas:** Create a blank canvas as in Version 1.
4. **Shift, Recolor, Paint:**  Get object indices, shift them, recolor them to their original colors, and finally paint them onto the canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  middle_row_index = h // 2
  target3 = (middle_row_index, w // 2)
  target4 = (middle_row_index + (h % 2), w // 2)
  obj3 = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == THREE)
  obj4 = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), shift(obj3, subtract(target3, centerofmass(obj3))))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj4, subtract(target4, centerofmass(obj4))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Targets:** Calculate target positions first, based on grid dimensions.
2. **Extract Objects:** Extract objects as in Version 1.
3. **Create Canvas:** Create a blank canvas as in Version 1.
4. **Shift and Paint (Stepwise):** Shift and paint each object individually onto the canvas in separate steps.


These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation using different DSL function combinations and logic. They illustrate the flexibility and power of the provided DSL for expressing spatial transformations.
