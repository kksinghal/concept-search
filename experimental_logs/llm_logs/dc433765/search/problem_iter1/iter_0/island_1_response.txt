## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation being applied to the input grids involves centering the non-zero objects along the horizontal axis while maintaining their original vertical positions. 

**Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:**  The '3' and '4' are centered horizontally. 
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** The '3' and '4' are brought closer to create a horizontally centered arrangement.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** The '3' and '4' are shifted to achieve horizontal centering.
* **Input_3 to Output_3:** Similar to the previous examples, the '3' and '4' are centered horizontally.
* **Input_4 to Output_4:** The '3' is moved up one row to align with the '4', and then both are centered horizontally.
* **Input_5 to Output_5:**  The '3' and '4' are centered horizontally.
* **Input_6 to Output_6:** The '3' is moved down one row to align with the '4', and then both are centered horizontally. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` function, each using a different approach to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - leftmost(obj))) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It first identifies all non-zero objects in the input grid `I` using the `objects` function.
2. **Centering Calculation:** For each object, it calculates the horizontal shift required to center it.
3. **Object Shifting:** It then shifts each object horizontally by the calculated amount.
4. **Painting on Canvas:** Finally, it paints all the shifted objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (0, (width(I) // 2) - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)})) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** This version extracts the non-zero objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Center Point Calculation:** It determines the horizontal center point of both the grid and each object.
3. **Shift Calculation:** The difference between the grid's center point and the object's center point gives the necessary horizontal shift.
4. **Object Placement:** It then shifts each object by the calculated amount horizontally.
5. **Grid Reconstruction:** Finally, it places the shifted objects onto a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj)) // 2)) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Isolation:** This version isolates the non-zero objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **Midpoint Determination:**  It finds the midpoint of each object along the horizontal axis.
3. **Center Alignment:** The objects are then shifted horizontally so that their midpoints align with the horizontal center of the grid.
4. **Placement on Canvas:** Finally, it positions these horizontally aligned objects onto a new grid of the same size as the original.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - (leftmost(obj) - (width(obj) // 2)))) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** The code first identifies each distinct object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Horizontal Center Calculation:** It calculates the horizontal center position for both the grid and each object. 
3. **Shift Determination:** The difference between these center positions determines the horizontal shift needed for each object.
4. **Object Shifting:** It then shifts each object horizontally by the calculated amount.
5. **Grid Population:** Finally, it populates a new grid, having the same dimensions as the input grid, with the shifted objects. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - rightmost(obj) - leftmost(obj)) // 2)) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Detection:** The program begins by detecting all the non-zero objects present in the input grid 'I'.
2. **Horizontal Span Measurement:** For each object, it measures the horizontal span, which is the difference between its rightmost and leftmost points. 
3. **Centering Shift Calculation:** Based on the object's span and the grid's width, it calculates the amount of horizontal shift required to center the object.
4. **Object Shifting:**  Each object is then shifted horizontally by the calculated amount.
5. **Final Grid Generation:** Lastly, the program generates a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, placing the centered objects onto this grid.
