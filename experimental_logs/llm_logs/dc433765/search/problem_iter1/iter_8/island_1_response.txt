## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers the objects in the input grid along the horizontal axis while maintaining their relative vertical positions. Let's break it down for each example:

* **Input 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6:** Each distinct object (identified by unique digits) in the input grid is moved horizontally so that its center aligns with the center of the corresponding row in the output grid. 
* **Input 4:** This input has only one object, and it remains in its original position in the output, demonstrating that the transformation doesn't unnecessarily move objects if they're already centered.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct code versions implementing the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def center_objects_horizontally(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - leftmost(obj))) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, False, False, True)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Horizontal Shift:** For each object `obj`, the code calculates the required horizontal shift to center it. This shift is `(width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - leftmost(obj)`, which represents the difference between the center of the grid and the center of the object.
3. **Shift and Merge:** Each object is shifted horizontally using `shift(obj, (0, calculated_shift))`. The shifted objects are then merged onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input using `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(...))`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def center_objects_horizontally(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(frozenset(shift(obj, (0,  width(canvas(0, shape(I))) // 2 - width(obj) // 2 - leftmost(obj)))) for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, this version starts by identifying all objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate Center:** This version explicitly calculates the horizontal center of both the canvas and each object.
3. **Shift and Paint:** It then shifts each object to align its center with the canvas center and paints them onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def center_objects_horizontally(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  centered_objs = []
  for obj in objs:
    offset = (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - leftmost(obj)
    centered_objs.append(shift(obj, (0, offset)))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(centered_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction and Initialization:** This version extracts objects and initializes an empty list `centered_objs` to store the horizontally centered objects.
2. **Iterative Centering:**  It iterates through each object, calculates the horizontal offset needed for centering, and appends the shifted object to the `centered_objs` list.
3. **Painting Centered Objects:** Finally, it paints all centered objects onto a blank canvas of the input grid's shape.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def center_objects_horizontally(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (0, (width(I) // 2) - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)})) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single line. It directly calculates the shift within the `shift` function by finding the difference between the center of the grid (`width(I) // 2`) and the center of each object (`leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2`). 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def center_objects_horizontally(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          frozenset(
              shift(
                  obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))
              )
              for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)
          )
      ),
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version maintains the core logic of version 4 but enhances readability by breaking down the nested function calls into separate lines. This formatting makes the code easier to understand and debug.

## Code Extraction:

You can easily copy and paste the code for each "Program Version" from the formatted blocks above. 

These versions offer a diverse set of solutions, each employing a slightly different approach to achieve the same result: centering objects horizontally within the input grid.
