## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids moves all non-zero objects to a common column while preserving their relative vertical ordering.  Let's break down each example:

* **Example 0:** The '3' and '4' are moved to column 1, maintaining their original top-to-bottom order.
* **Example 1, 2, 3:**  The same logic applies, with the non-zero digits moved to the center column while keeping their relative positions.
* **Example 4, 5, 6:**  These examples further demonstrate the consistency of the transformation, regardless of grid size or the initial positions of the non-zero digits.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation, using only the functions provided in the DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  mid = width(I) // 2
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (0, mid - center(obj)[1])) for obj in objs})) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`mid = width(I) // 2`:**  Calculates the middle column index of the grid.
3. **`shift(obj, (0, mid - center(obj)[1]))`:** Shifts each object horizontally so that its center aligns with the middle column.
4. **`merge({... for obj in objs})`:**  Combines the shifted objects.
5. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`:**  Paints the combined objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, False, False, True), key=lambda obj: center(obj)[0])
  h, w = shape(I)
  output = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for j, obj in enumerate(objs):
    output = paint(output, shift(obj, (0, w // 2 - center(obj)[1])))
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`sorted(objects(...), key=lambda obj: center(obj)[0])`:**  Extracts objects and sorts them based on their vertical position (row index of their center).
2. **`output = canvas(0, (h, w))`:** Creates an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **`for j, obj in enumerate(objs): ...`:** Iterates through the sorted objects.
4. **`output = paint(output, shift(obj, (0, w // 2 - center(obj)[1])))`:**  For each object, it shifts the object horizontally to the middle column and paints it onto the `output` grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    return tuple(tuple(v if (i,j) in {(i, w // 2) for i in range(h)} else 0 for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:** Get the height and width of the input grid.
2. **(i,j) in {(i, w // 2) for i in range(h)}:** Checks if a cell's index is in the middle column.
3. **v if ... else 0:** If the cell is in the middle column, it keeps its original value (`v`); otherwise, it sets the value to 0.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    c = width(I) // 2 
    new_objs = {frozenset({(v, (i, c)) for v, (i, _) in obj}) for obj in objs}
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Identifies all non-background objects.
2. **`c = width(I) // 2`:** Calculates the middle column index.
3. **`frozenset({(v, (i, c)) for v, (i, _) in obj})`:** For each object, it creates a new object where all cells are placed in the middle column (`c`) while maintaining their original row index (`i`).
4. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))`:**  Paints the combined objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  out = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        out = paint(out, {(val, (i, width(I) // 2))})
  return out
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`out = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates an empty canvas.
2. **`for i, row in enumerate(I): ...`:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **`if val != 0:`:**  If a cell has a non-zero value, it's considered part of an object.
4. **`out = paint(out, {(val, (i, width(I) // 2))})`:**  Paints the cell onto the output canvas at the same row index (`i`) but in the middle column.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the transformation task using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL in expressing the desired spatial manipulations.
