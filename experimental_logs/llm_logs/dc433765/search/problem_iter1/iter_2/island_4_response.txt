## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids to achieve the output grids can be described as follows:

**For each object in the grid:**

1. **Center horizontally:** The object is moved horizontally so that its center aligns with the center column of the grid.
2. **Maintain vertical position:** The object's vertical position remains unchanged.

This effectively centers all objects in the grid along the vertical axis while preserving their relative vertical ordering.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - leftmost(obj))) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`, treating it as non-univalued, non-diagonal, and excluding the background.
2. **`{shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - leftmost(obj))) for obj in objs}`:** For each object `obj` in the set of objects:
    - `(width(I) - width(obj)) // 2` calculates the horizontal offset required to center the object within the grid.
    - `leftmost(obj)` provides the column index of the leftmost cell of the object.
    - `shift(obj, (0, ...))` moves the object horizontally by the calculated offset.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the shifted objects back into a single set.
4. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`:**  Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid and paints the merged objects onto it.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (0,  width(I) // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1])) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version follows a similar structure to version 1, but utilizes the `centerofmass` function to determine the object's center for horizontal shifting.

1. **`centerofmass(obj)[1]`:** Retrieves the column index of the object's center of mass.
2. **`width(I) // 2 - ...`:** Calculates the offset for horizontal centering based on the center of mass.
3. The remaining steps are identical to version 1.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - width(toindices(obj))) // 2 - leftmost(toindices(obj)))) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `fgpartition` instead of `objects` to obtain a set of objects without considering diagonals or univalued nature. 

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Partitions the input grid into objects based on color, excluding the background.
2. **`toindices(obj)`:** Extracts the indices of the object's cells.
3. The calculation of the horizontal offset and subsequent steps remain similar to previous versions.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  mid = width(I) // 2
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (0, mid - leftmost(obj) - width(obj) // 2)) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version pre-calculates the grid's middle column index (`mid`) to optimize for repeated access.

1. **`mid = width(I) // 2`:** Stores the middle column index for efficiency.
2. The offset calculation and remaining steps are similar to previous versions. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v for j, v in enumerate(row) if j != (width(I) - 1) // 2) + tuple(v for k, v in enumerate(row) if k == (width(I) - 1) // 2) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version deviates from previous versions by directly manipulating the grid data instead of using object-based operations.

1. **Iterates through each row:** For each row in the grid `I`, it performs the following:
2. **`tuple(v for j, v in enumerate(row) if j != (width(I) - 1) // 2)`:**  Creates a tuple containing all elements of the row except the element at the middle column.
3. **`tuple(v for k, v in enumerate(row) if k == (width(I) - 1) // 2)`:** Creates a tuple containing only the element at the middle column of the row.
4. **`... + ...`:** Concatenates the two tuples, effectively moving the middle column element to the end of the row.
5. **`tuple(...) for row in I)`:** Applies this manipulation to each row, resulting in a transformed grid.
