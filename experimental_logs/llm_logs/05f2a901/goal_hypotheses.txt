['Move the red shape to the bottom of the grid, keeping the same shape and orientation. Move the blue shape to the top of the grid, keeping the same shape and orientation.', 'Slide the red shape down until it reaches the bottom row of the grid, maintaining its original form. Similarly, move the blue shape upwards until it touches the top of the grid, preserving its shape.', 'Shift the red colored shape downwards until it aligns with the bottom edge of the grid, while keeping its form intact. Simultaneously, shift the blue colored shape upwards until it reaches the top edge of the grid, without altering its form.', 'The transformation involves moving the red shape down to the bottom of the grid and the blue shape up to the top of the grid, both maintaining their original shapes.', 'The red shape is translated downwards until it reaches the bottom of the grid, and the blue shape is translated upwards until it reaches the top of the grid, with both shapes retaining their original form. ']['Move the shapes up so that the top of the highest shape is in the same row as the bottom of the lowest shape.', 'Shift all shapes upwards until the top of the tallest shape aligns with the bottom of the shortest shape, maintaining their horizontal positions.', 'Slide each colored shape upwards until the top of the tallest shape is in line with the bottom of the shortest shape, keeping the horizontal position the same.', 'Move each colored shape up until the top of the tallest shape is in the same row as the bottom of the shortest shape, without changing their horizontal positions.', 'Retain the horizontal positions of the shapes and move them vertically such that the top of the highest shape and the bottom of the lowest shape are in the same row.
