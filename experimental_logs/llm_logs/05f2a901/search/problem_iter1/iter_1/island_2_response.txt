## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as "gravity with a fixed object". 

* **Fixed Object:** The object with color '8' remains fixed in its position.
* **Gravity:** All other objects "fall" downwards due to gravity, stopping when they either hit the bottom of the grid or encounter another object (including the fixed object).

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The '2' object falls until it reaches the fixed '8' object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The '2' object falls until it hits the bottom of the grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* The '2' object falls until it reaches the fixed '8' object.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:


### **Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  fixed_obj = extract(objects(grid, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == EIGHT)
  movable_objs = objects(grid, T, T, T) - {fixed_obj}
  new_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(grid)), fixed_obj)
  for obj in movable_objs:
    while True:
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, DOWN)
      if any((i + 1, j) in asindices(grid) and grid[i + 1][j] == ZERO for v, (i, j) in shifted_obj) and backdrop(shifted_obj).issubset(asindices(grid)):
        obj = shifted_obj
      else:
        break
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  The code identifies the fixed object (color 8) and the set of movable objects.
2. **Initialize Grid:** A new grid is initialized with all zeros and the fixed object is painted.
3. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through each movable object.  
    * For each object, it repeatedly tries to shift the object downwards.
    * If the shift results in a valid position (within the grid and not overlapping with other objects), the object is moved.
    * This process continues until the object can no longer move down.
4. **Paint Objects:**  After each object has been moved to its final position, it is painted onto the new grid.
5. **Return Grid:** The final grid with the transformed objects is returned.


### **Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  fixed_obj = extract(objects(grid, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == EIGHT)
  new_grid = grid
  for i in reversed(range(height(grid) - 1)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if new_grid[i][j] != ZERO and new_grid[i][j] != EIGHT and ((i + 1, j) not in asindices(grid) or new_grid[i + 1][j] == ZERO):
        new_grid = paint(cover(new_grid, {(new_grid[i][j], (i, j))}), {(new_grid[i][j], (i + 1, j))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Fixed Object:**  The code identifies the fixed object (color 8).
2. **Iterate through Grid (Bottom-Up):** The code iterates through the grid from the second-to-last row upwards.
3. **Move Objects Down:** For each cell:
    * It checks if the cell is not empty, not the fixed object, and the cell below is either outside the grid or empty.
    * If these conditions are met, the object at the current cell is moved down by one row.
4. **Return Grid:** The final grid with the transformed objects is returned. 


### **Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  fixed_obj = extract(objects(grid, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == EIGHT)
  movable_area = difference(asindices(grid), toindices(fixed_obj))
  def fall_object(loc):
    i, j = loc
    while (i + 1, j) in movable_area:
      i += 1
    return (i, j)
  new_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(grid)), fixed_obj)
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if (i, j) in movable_area and val != ZERO:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(val, fall_object((i, j)))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Movable Area:** The code identifies the fixed object and defines the movable area as all grid cells except those occupied by the fixed object.
2. **Define `fall_object` Function:** This function takes a cell location and returns the final position the object at that location would fall to. It does this by moving the object down within the `movable_area` until it can't move further.
3. **Initialize Grid:**  A new grid is initialized with all zeros and the fixed object is painted.
4. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through the original grid. For each cell within the `movable_area` that contains an object:
    * It uses the `fall_object` function to determine the final position of the object.
    * The object is then painted at its final position on the new grid.
5. **Return Grid:** The final grid with the transformed objects is returned.

### **Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  fixed_obj = extract(objects(grid, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == EIGHT)
  new_grid = canvas(ZERO, shape(grid))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != ZERO:
        new_i = i
        while new_i + 1 < height(grid) and grid[new_i + 1][j] == ZERO and (new_i + 1, j) not in toindices(fixed_obj):
          new_i += 1
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(val, (new_i, j))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Fixed Object:**  The code identifies the fixed object (color 8).
2. **Initialize Grid:**  A new grid is initialized with all zeros.
3. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through each cell of the original grid. For each non-empty cell:
    * It initializes a new row index (`new_i`) to the current row.
    * It then repeatedly tries to move the object down as long as the cell below is within the grid, empty, and not part of the fixed object.
    * Once the final row is determined, the object is painted at its new location on the new grid.
4. **Return Grid:** The final grid with the transformed objects is returned.


### **Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  fixed_obj = extract(objects(grid, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == EIGHT)
  def fall_path(obj):
    path = [obj]
    while True:
      next_obj = shift(path[-1], DOWN)
      if any(v != ZERO or (i, j) in toindices(fixed_obj) for v, (i, j) in next_obj if 0 <= i < height(grid) and 0 <= j < width(grid)) or not backdrop(next_obj).issubset(asindices(grid)):
        break
      path.append(next_obj)
    return path[-1]
  
  movable_objs = objects(grid, T, T, T) - {fixed_obj}
  new_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(grid)), fixed_obj)
  for obj in movable_objs:
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, fall_path(obj))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to other versions, this version identifies the fixed object and the set of movable objects.
2. **Define `fall_path` Function:**  This function takes an object and simulates its falling path. 
    * It creates a list `path` to store the object's positions during the fall, starting with the object's initial position.
    * It then repeatedly shifts the object down, adding each new position to `path`, until it encounters an obstacle (another object, the grid boundary, or the fixed object).
    * Finally, it returns the last object in `path`, representing the final position of the falling object.
3. **Initialize Grid:**  A new grid is initialized with all zeros, and the fixed object is painted.
4. **Iterate, Calculate Paths, and Paint:** The code iterates through the movable objects.
    * For each object, it calls the `fall_path` function to determine the object's final position after falling.
    * The object is then painted at its final position on the new grid.
5. **Return Grid:** The final grid with the transformed objects is returned.

These five versions offer diverse implementations using different strategies and DSL functions to achieve the same gravity-based transformation. Each version highlights a different approach to problem-solving in this DSL.
