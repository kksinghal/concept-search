## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be moving all non-background objects (2 and 8 in these examples) to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions. The order of the objects from top to bottom in the output corresponds to their order of appearance from bottom to top in the input.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = order(x1, lambda o: uppermost(o))
  x3 = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  x4 = rot90(x3)
  x5 = fold(lambda g, o: paint(g, shift(o, (height(g) - height(o), 0))), x4, x2)
  O = rot270(x5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Order objects:** `x2 = order(x1, lambda o: uppermost(o))` sorts the objects based on their vertical position in the input, with the bottom-most object first.
3. **Create empty canvas:** `x3 = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` generates an empty grid with the same dimensions as the input.
4. **Rotate canvas:** `x4 = rot90(x3)` rotates the empty canvas 90 degrees clockwise. This aligns the bottom edge with the left edge for easier object placement.
5. **Place objects:** `x5 = fold(lambda g, o: paint(g, shift(o, (height(g) - height(o), 0))), x4, x2)` iterates through the sorted objects `x2` and paints them onto the rotated canvas `x4`. Each object `o` is shifted downwards by `height(g) - height(o)` to place it at the bottom of the canvas.
6. **Rotate back:** `O = rot270(x5)` rotates the canvas back to its original orientation.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  x3 = (height(x2), 0)
  O = fold(lambda g, o: paint(g, shift(o, subtract(x3, (height(o), 0)))), x2, x1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts non-background objects from input `I`.
2. **Create empty canvas:** `x2 = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input.
3. **Calculate bottom offset:** `x3 = (height(x2), 0)` determines the vertical offset required to place objects at the bottom of the canvas.
4. **Place objects:** `O = fold(lambda g, o: paint(g, shift(o, subtract(x3, (height(o), 0)))), x2, x1)` iterates through each object `o` in `x1` and paints it onto the canvas `x2` after shifting it downwards by `x3 - (height(o), 0)`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = sorted(x1, key=lambda o: uppermost(o))
  x3 = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  x4 = height(x3)
  O = x3
  for obj in x2:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (x4 - height(obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort:** Extracts objects (`x1`) and sorts them (`x2`) based on their uppermost row.
2. **Create Canvas:** Generates an empty canvas (`x3`) matching the input dimensions.
3. **Get Height:** Stores the canvas height (`x4`) for offset calculation.
4. **Iterate and Paint:** Iterates through sorted objects, painting each onto the canvas after shifting them down to the bottom row based on their individual heights and the canvas height.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = [(uppermost(obj), obj) for obj in x1]
  x3 = sorted(x2)
  x4 = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  O = x4
  for i in range(len(x3)):
    O = paint(O, shift(x3[i][1], (height(x4) - height(x3[i][1]), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Pair:** Extracts objects (`x1`) and pairs them with their uppermost row index (`x2`).
2. **Sort Pairs:** Sorts object-index pairs (`x3`) based on the index (uppermost row).
3. **Create Canvas:** Generates an empty canvas (`x4`) of the same size as the input.
4. **Iterate and Paint:** Iterates through the sorted pairs, painting each object onto the canvas after shifting it down to the bottom row based on its height and the canvas height.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = lambda o: uppermost(o)
  x3 = sorted(x1, key=x2)
  x4 = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  x5 = partial(shift, b=(0,0))
  O = fold(lambda g, o: paint(g, x5(a=o, b=(height(x4)-height(o), 0))), x4, x3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extracts non-background objects from the input (`x1`).
2. **Define Sorting Key:** Defines a lambda function (`x2`) to be used as the key for sorting objects based on their uppermost row.
3. **Sort Objects:** Sorts the extracted objects (`x3`) using the defined sorting key.
4. **Create Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas (`x4`) with the same dimensions as the input.
5. **Define Shifting Function:** Defines a partially applied `shift` function (`x5`) with a fixed horizontal shift of 0.
6. **Iterate and Paint:** Uses `fold` to iterate through the sorted objects and paint them onto the canvas after applying the shifting function to move each object to the bottom row while maintaining its horizontal position. 


These are just a few examples, and many other variations are possible. The key is to break down the transformation into smaller steps and use the DSL functions effectively to achieve each step.
