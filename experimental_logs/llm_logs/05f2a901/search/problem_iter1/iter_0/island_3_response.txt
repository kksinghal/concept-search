## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and moving them to specific locations near the bottom of the grid. The objects maintain their shape, size, and color during the transformation. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The 2x2 '8' object is moved from its original position to the bottom left corner of the grid. 
- The '2' object is moved down to the bottom rows of the grid, maintaining its original shape.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, both the '8' and '2' objects are moved downwards. 
- The '2' object is positioned to the right of the '8' object.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- The '2' object at the bottom is moved upwards to the center of the grid. 
- The '8' object maintains its position.

**Overall Pattern:**
The transformation appears to gravitate objects towards the bottom of the grid, with a preference for placing smaller objects to the left. The exact positioning logic, however, requires further investigation through code analysis and experimentation.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    obj2 = argmax(objs, lambda obj: (color(obj), -size(obj))) 
    obj8 = other(objs, obj2)
    bottom_left = (height(I) - height(obj8), 0)
    O = paint(paint(I, shift(obj8, subtract(bottom_left, ulcorner(obj8)))), shift(obj2, (height(I)-height(obj2)-1, 0)))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:**  Identifies the '2' and '8' objects.
2.  **Determine Target Positions:** Calculates the target position for each object (bottom-left corner for '8', bottom-leftmost available for '2').
3.  **Move Objects:**  Shifts the objects to their target positions.
4.  **Paint Objects:**  Paints the objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj2 = argmax(objs, lambda obj: (color(obj) == 2, size(obj)))
  obj8 = other(objs, obj2)
  new_obj2 = shift(obj2, (height(I)-height(obj2),0))
  new_obj8 = shift(obj8, (height(I)-height(obj8),0))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_obj2), new_obj8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Extracts individual objects ('2' and '8').
2.  **Calculate New Positions:** Computes the desired positions for both objects based on their height and the grid dimensions.
3.  **Shift Objects:**  Moves the objects to the calculated positions.
4.  **Combine and Paint:** Places the shifted objects onto a blank canvas, effectively reconstructing the desired output.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj2 = argmax(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 2)
  obj8 = argmax(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 8)
  target2 = (height(I) - height(obj2), 0)
  target8 = (height(I) - height(obj8), 0)
  new_obj2 = shift(obj2, subtract(target2, ulcorner(obj2)))
  new_obj8 = shift(obj8, subtract(target8, ulcorner(obj8)))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_obj2), new_obj8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Isolate Objects:**  Extracts the '2' and '8' objects.
2.  **Define Target Locations:**  Calculates the bottom-left corner coordinates for placing the objects.
3.  **Relocate Objects:** Shifts both objects to their respective target positions.
4.  **Reconstruct Grid:** Creates a blank grid and paints the relocated objects onto it.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    obj2 = argmax(objs, size) if size(first(objs)) != size(last(objs)) else argmax(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
    obj8 = other(objs, obj2)
    h = height(I)
    new_obj2 = shift(obj2, (h - height(obj2), 0))
    new_obj8 = shift(obj8, (h - height(obj8), 0))
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_obj2), new_obj8)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Locates the '2' and '8' objects, handling cases where they might have the same size.
2.  **Calculate Offsets:** Determines the vertical offset needed to move each object to the bottom of the grid.
3.  **Shift Objects:** Moves both objects downward based on the calculated offsets.
4.  **Construct Output:** Creates an empty grid and paints the repositioned objects onto it.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj2 = argmax(objs, lambda obj: (color(obj) == 2, -size(obj)))
  obj8 = other(objs, obj2)
  O = paint(
      paint(canvas(0, shape(I)),
            shift(obj2, (h-height(obj2)-1, 0))), 
            shift(obj8, (h-height(obj8), 0))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Objects:**  Identifies the '2' and '8' objects, prioritizing the smaller object with color '2' if they have equal sizes.
2.  **Calculate Destinations:** Determines the target bottom-left coordinates for both objects.
3.  **Move and Paint:**  Shifts the objects to their calculated positions and paints them onto a new canvas.
