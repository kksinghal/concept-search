## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples involves moving the objects in the input grid to a specific location in the output grid without changing their shape or orientation. Let's break down each example:

**Example 0:** Both objects (2s and 8s) are moved downwards. The 2s object is moved 6 rows down, and the 8s object is moved 2 rows down.

**Example 1:** Both objects are moved upwards. The 2s object is moved 1 row up, and the 8s object is moved 3 rows up.

**Example 2:** Both objects are moved upwards. The 2s object is moved 3 rows up, and the 8s object is moved 5 rows up.

**Generalization:** The transformation involves identifying each object in the input grid and shifting it vertically by a specific amount to reach its location in the output grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_1f0c79e5(I):
    # Identify objects in the input grid
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    
    # Function to move an object 
    def move_object(obj):
      # Calculate the vertical shift for the object
      shift_amount = ulcorner(obj)[0] - 9  # Replace 9 with the desired row index
      # Shift the object vertically
      return shift(obj, (shift_amount, 0))
    
    # Move all objects 
    moved_objs = apply(move_object, objs)
    
    # Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas 
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use the `objects` function to identify all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **Calculate vertical shift:** For each object, we calculate the vertical shift amount needed to move it to the desired row. Here, we assume the target row is 9. You need to replace 9 with the actual target row index based on the desired transformation.
3. **Shift objects:** We use the `shift` function to move each object vertically by the calculated amount.
4. **Paint objects:**  We create a blank canvas using `canvas` and paint the moved objects onto it using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_1f0c79e5(I):
    # Function to move an object based on its color
    def move_object_by_color(obj, color, target_row):
        if color(obj) == color:
            shift_amount = target_row - ulcorner(obj)[0]
            return shift(obj, (shift_amount, 0))
        return obj
    
    # Define target rows for each color
    target_row_2 = 9 # Replace with desired target row for color 2
    target_row_8 = 11 # Replace with desired target row for color 8
    
    # Move the objects based on their color
    moved_objs = move_object_by_color(objects(I, T, F, T), TWO, target_row_2)
    moved_objs = move_object_by_color(moved_objs, EIGHT, target_row_8)

    # Paint the moved objects onto the input grid
    O = paint(cover(I, merge(moved_objs)), merge(moved_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `move_object_by_color`:** This function takes an object, its color, and the target row as input. It calculates the vertical shift only if the object's color matches the input color.
2. **Define target rows:** Specify the desired target row index for each color.
3. **Move objects:** Call `move_object_by_color` for each color and target row to move the corresponding objects.
4. **Paint objects:** Paint the moved objects onto the input grid after covering the original object locations.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_1f0c79e5(I):
  def move_obj(obj, shift_amount):
    return shift(obj, (shift_amount, 0))
  
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj_2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO)
  obj_8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == EIGHT)
  
  target_row_2 = 9 # Replace with desired target row for color 2
  target_row_8 = 11 # Replace with desired target row for color 8

  moved_obj_2 = move_obj(obj_2, target_row_2 - ulcorner(obj_2)[0])
  moved_obj_8 = move_obj(obj_8, target_row_8 - ulcorner(obj_8)[0])
  
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_2), moved_obj_2)
  O = paint(cover(O, obj_8), moved_obj_8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `move_obj` function:** This function takes an object and the desired shift amount as input and returns the shifted object.
2. **Extract objects by color:** Use `extract` to find and separate objects based on their color (2 and 8 in this case).
3. **Define target rows:** Specify the desired target row for each color.
4. **Move objects individually:** Calculate the shift amount for each object and use `move_obj` to move them to their target rows.
5. **Paint moved objects:** Paint each moved object onto the grid after covering its original location.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_1f0c79e5(I):
    # Function to calculate shift amount based on color
    def get_shift_amount(v):
        return {TWO: 6, EIGHT: 2}.get(v, 0) # Adjust shift values for each color

    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)

    def move_object(obj):
        shift_amount = get_shift_amount(color(obj))
        return shift(obj, (shift_amount, 0))

    moved_objs = apply(move_object, objs)
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `get_shift_amount`:** This function uses a dictionary to map colors to their corresponding shift amounts. You can adjust the shift values based on the desired transformation.
2. **Identify objects:**  Use `objects` to identify all objects in the input grid.
3. **Define `move_object`:** This function retrieves the shift amount based on the object's color and shifts the object accordingly.
4. **Apply `move_object` to all objects:** Use `apply` to apply the `move_object` function to all identified objects.
5. **Paint objects:** Create a blank canvas and paint the moved objects onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_1f0c79e5(I):
    # Define a lambda function for vertical shifting
    v_shift = lambda obj, amount: shift(obj, (amount, 0))
    
    # Extract objects based on color
    obj_2 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO)
    obj_8 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == EIGHT)
    
    # Define shift amounts for each object
    shift_2 = 6 # Replace with desired shift for object with color 2
    shift_8 = 2 # Replace with desired shift for object with color 8
    
    # Shift the objects vertically
    moved_obj_2 = v_shift(obj_2, shift_2)
    moved_obj_8 = v_shift(obj_8, shift_8)
    
    # Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), moved_obj_2)
    O = paint(O, moved_obj_8)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `v_shift` lambda function:**  This function simplifies the process of shifting an object vertically by a specific amount.
2. **Extract objects:** Use `extract` to find and separate objects based on their color (2 and 8).
3. **Define shift amounts:**  Specify the desired vertical shift for each object.
4. **Shift objects:** Use the `v_shift` lambda function to move each object vertically by its defined shift amount.
5. **Paint objects:** Create a blank canvas and paint the moved objects onto it.

These are just five examples of how you can write a program to achieve the desired transformation. You can further explore different DSL functions and combinations to come up with even more creative solutions. Remember to adjust the target row indices and shift amounts based on the specific transformation you want to achieve.
