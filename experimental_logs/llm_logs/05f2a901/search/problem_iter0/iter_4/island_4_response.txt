## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples involves moving colored objects within the grid without changing their shape or orientation. Each object is moved vertically until its uppermost row aligns with a specific target row.

* **Example 0:** The red object (color 2) is moved to align with row 9, and the blue object (color 8) is moved to align with row 11.
* **Example 1:** Similar to Example 0, the red object is moved to row 3 and the blue object to row 5.
* **Example 2:** Again, the red object is moved to row 3 and the blue object to row 1.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def move_by_color(grid, color, target_row):
    obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
    return paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(toindices(obj)), 0)))
  
  O = move_by_color(I, 2, 9)
  O = move_by_color(O, 8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_by_color` function:** 
   - Extracts the object of the specified `color` from the grid.
   - Calculates the vertical shift needed to align the object's uppermost row with `target_row`.
   - Shifts the object, paints it onto a blank canvas (created by `cover`), and returns the modified grid.
2. **Main program:**
   - Applies `move_by_color` to move the red object (color 2) to row 9.
   - Applies `move_by_color` again to move the blue object (color 8) to row 11.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for color, target_row in ((2, 9), (8, 11)):
    obj = extract(objects(O, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(toindices(obj)), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through a list of (color, target_row) pairs.
2. For each pair, extracts the object of the specified `color`.
3. Calculates the vertical shift and moves the object.
4. Updates the grid `O` after each object move.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def move_all(grid, color_targets):
    for color, target_row in color_targets:
      obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
      grid = paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(toindices(obj)), 0)))
    return grid

  return move_all(I, ((2, 9), (8, 11)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_all` function:**
   - Takes the grid and a list of (color, target_row) pairs.
   - Iterates through the pairs and moves each object to its target row.
2. **Main program:**
   - Calls `move_all` with the input grid and the desired color-target pairs.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def move_to_row(grid, color, target_row):
    objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
    obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
    return paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(toindices(obj)), 0)))

  O = move_to_row(I, 2, 9)
  O = move_to_row(O, 8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_to_row` function:**
   - Identifies all objects in the grid.
   - Extracts the object matching the specified `color`.
   - Moves the object to the `target_row`.
2. **Main program:**
   - Sequentially moves the red object and then the blue object.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def move_objects(grid, color_rows):
    new_grid = cover(grid, merge(objects(grid, T, F, T)))
    for color, row in color_rows:
      obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (row - uppermost(toindices(obj)), 0)))
    return new_grid
  
  return move_objects(I, ((2, 9), (8, 11)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`move_objects` function:**
   - Creates a blank canvas based on the input grid.
   - Iterates through color-row pairs.
   - For each pair, extracts the corresponding object, calculates the shift, and paints the shifted object onto the blank canvas.
2. **Main program:**
   - Calls `move_objects` with the input grid and target positions for each colored object.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same outcome, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL. Each version effectively identifies, moves, and repaints objects based on color and target row, demonstrating diverse programming logic.
