## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve moving specific colored objects within the grid to specific target rows while preserving their original shape and relative horizontal position. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The object formed by '2's is moved from rows 2-4 to rows 9-10. The object formed by '8's is moved from rows 10-11 to rows 11-12. 

**Pair 1:** Similar to Pair 0, the '2' object is moved to row 9 (spanning rows 9-11) and the '8' object to row 11 (spanning rows 11-12).

**Pair 2:**  Again, the '2' object is moved to rows 7-9 and the '8' object to rows 1-2. 

**In summary:** The transformation consistently moves the object with color '2' to a target row of '9' and the object with color '8' to a target row of '11'. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_by_color(grid, color, target_row):
    obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
    return paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  
  O = move_by_color(I, 2, 9)
  O = move_by_color(O, 8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_by_color` Function:** 
   - Takes the grid, target color, and target row as input.
   - Extracts the object of the target color using `extract` and a lambda function to check the object's color.
   - Uses `cover` to remove the object from the grid, `shift` to move it to the target row, and `paint` to draw it back onto the grid.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Calls `move_by_color` for color '2' and target row 9.
   - Calls `move_by_color` again for color '8' and target row 11, using the updated grid from the previous step.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_to_target(obj, target_row):
    return shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0))

  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj_2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj_8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)

  O = paint(cover(I, obj_2), move_to_target(obj_2, 9))
  O = paint(cover(O, obj_8), move_to_target(obj_8, 11))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 1 but extracts both objects first, then applies the movement and painting in separate steps.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  targets = ((2, 9), (8, 11))
  O = I
  for color, target_row in targets:
    obj = extract(objects(O, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through a list of (color, target_row) tuples, performing the object extraction, movement, and painting within the loop.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_all(grid, color_targets):
    objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
    for color, target_row in color_targets:
      obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
      grid = paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))
    return grid

  return move_all(I, ((2, 9), (8, 11)))
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines a `move_all` function that takes the grid and a list of (color, target_row) tuples. It iterates through this list, moving each object to its target row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_to_row(grid, color, target_row):
    return paint(
        cover(grid, extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)),
        shift(extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color), (target_row - uppermost(extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)), 0))
    )
  O = move_to_row(I, 2, 9)
  O = move_to_row(O, 8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to version 1 but instead of using an inner function, it defines all the logic within the `move_to_row` function making the code more compact.

These five versions showcase different ways to achieve the same transformation, illustrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Remember to test each version thoroughly with various inputs to ensure its correctness.
