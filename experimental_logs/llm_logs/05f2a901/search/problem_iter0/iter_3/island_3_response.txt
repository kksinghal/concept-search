## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving specific objects (identified by their color) to the bottom of the grid without changing their horizontal position. 

**Input_0:** The objects with colors 2 and 8 are moved to the bottom of the grid.
**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, objects with colors 2 and 8 are shifted downwards. 
**Input_2:**  Again, objects of colors 2 and 8 are moved to the bottom while maintaining their horizontal alignment.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL functions, inspired by existing program structures and aiming for perfect transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h = height(I)
  moved_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (h - 1 - lowermost(obj), 0)) for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) if color(obj) in {TWO, EIGHT})
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color:** `bg = mostcolor(I)` determines the background color.
2. **Extract movable objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` extracts objects, and those with color 2 or 8 are selected.
3. **Calculate shift:** `(h - 1 - lowermost(obj), 0)` computes the downward shift for each object.
4. **Shift objects:** `shift(obj, ...)` moves the objects to the bottom.
5. **Paint on canvas:** `paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), moved_objs)` creates a blank canvas and paints the moved objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h = height(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) in {TWO, EIGHT}:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h - 1 - lowermost(obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:** `O = canvas(bg, shape(I))` initializes a canvas with the background color.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The code loops through each object in the input grid.
3. **Conditional shift and paint:** If the object's color is 2 or 8, it is shifted down and painted onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = I
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] in {TWO, EIGHT}:
        O = fill(O, bg, ((i, j),))
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], ((h - 1 - (i - uppermost(ofcolor(I, I[i][j]))), j),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:**  The code iterates over each cell of the input grid.
2. **Identify and erase target cells:** If a cell contains 2 or 8, it's erased by filling with the background color.
3. **Calculate new position:** The new vertical position is calculated based on the object's initial uppermost row.
4. **Fill at the new position:** The cell is filled with its original color at the calculated bottom position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h = height(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value in {TWO, EIGHT}:
        O = fill(O, value, ((h - 1 - (i - uppermost(ofcolor(I, value))), j),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:** Similar to Version 2, a canvas filled with the background color is created.
2. **Iterate and directly fill:** The code iterates through the input grid, and if a cell contains 2 or 8, it directly fills the corresponding bottom position on the canvas with the original color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h = height(I)
  target_objs = mfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) in {TWO, EIGHT}, objects(I, True, False, False))
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(shift(obj, (h - 1 - lowermost(obj), 0)) for obj in target_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract target objects:**  `mfilter` filters and merges the objects with color 2 or 8.
2. **Shift target objects:**  The `shift` function moves the extracted objects downwards.
3. **Paint on canvas:**  A new canvas is created, and the shifted target objects are painted onto it.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a unique combination of functions, making them distinct solutions rather than mere variations.
