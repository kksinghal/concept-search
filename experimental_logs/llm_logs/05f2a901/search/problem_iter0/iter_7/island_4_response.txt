## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects within the grid to specific target rows. The target rows seem to be consistent across different inputs:

* **Color 2:** Target row is 9
* **Color 8:** Target row is 11

The objects are moved as a whole, preserving their internal structure and relative positions of cells within the object. The movement is strictly vertical.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def move_object(grid, color, target_row):
    obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
    return paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  
  O = move_object(I, 2, 9)
  O = move_object(O, 8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_object` function:** 
   - Takes the grid, the color of the object to move, and the target row as input.
   - Extracts the object of the specified color using `extract` and a lambda function to filter objects based on color.
   - Calculates the vertical shift amount (`target_row - uppermost(obj)`).
   - Uses `shift` to move the object vertically.
   - Uses `cover` to remove the object from its original position in the grid.
   - Uses `paint` to draw the shifted object onto the grid.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Calls `move_object` twice, once for each color (2 and 8), to move them to their respective target rows.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj_2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj_8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  
  O = paint(
      paint(
          cover(cover(I, obj_2), obj_8), 
          shift(obj_2, (9 - uppermost(obj_2), 0))
      ), 
      shift(obj_8, (11 - uppermost(obj_8), 0))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extracts objects of color 2 and 8 using `extract` and lambda functions.
2. **Nested Painting:** 
   - Uses nested `cover` calls to remove both objects from the original grid.
   - Uses nested `paint` calls to draw the shifted objects onto the grid, starting with the object of color 2 and then the object of color 8. 
   -  Calculates the vertical shift amount for each object within the `shift` function.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def move_to_row(grid, val, target_row):
    objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
    obj = extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == val)
    return paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))

  O = move_to_row(I, 2, 9)
  O = move_to_row(O, 8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines a more general `move_to_row` function that can move any object to a specified target row. 
- It's structurally very similar to version 1 but uses a different function name and a more descriptive variable name (`val` instead of `color`).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def move_and_paint(grid, obj, target_row):
    return paint(grid, shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj_2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj_8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)

  O = cover(cover(I, obj_2), obj_8)
  O = move_and_paint(O, obj_2, 9)
  O = move_and_paint(O, obj_8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version separates the object movement and painting into a dedicated `move_and_paint` function. 
- It first covers both objects, then iteratively moves and paints them at their target rows.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def move_color(grid, color, target_row):
    return paint(
        cover(grid, extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)),
        shift(extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color), (target_row - uppermost(extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)), 0))
    )

  O = move_color(I, 2, 9)
  O = move_color(O, 8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version condenses the logic into a single `move_color` function that performs all the steps (object extraction, covering, shifting, and painting) within a single line. 
- While less readable, it showcases a different way of combining the DSL functions.

All five versions achieve the same goal of moving objects to specific target rows, but they demonstrate different approaches to organizing the code and using the DSL functions.
