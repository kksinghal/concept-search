## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects within the grid based on their color.  The destination row for each object depends on its color.

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The object composed of '2's is moved down to the bottom of the grid, while the object composed of '8's remains in its original position.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Both the '2' object and the '8' object are moved down. The '2' object is positioned above the '8' object.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:**  Similar to Input_1, both objects move down. The '8' object is now above the '2' object. 

**Generalization:** The transformation aims to position objects at specific rows based on their color.  The order of these objects in the final grid is determined by their initial vertical arrangement.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve the transformation:


### **Program Version 1:**

**Code:**
```python
def program_v1(I):
  def move_by_color(obj, color, target_row):
    if color == color(obj):
      return shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0))
    return obj
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  moved_objs = frozenset(move_by_color(obj, TWO, 9) for obj in objs)
  moved_objs = frozenset(move_by_color(obj, EIGHT, 11) for obj in moved_objs)
  return paint(cover(I, merge(objs)), merge(moved_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_by_color` function:** 
   - Takes an object, its color, and the target row as input.
   - If the object's color matches the given color, it calculates the vertical shift needed to move the object to the `target_row`.
   - Returns the shifted object or the original object if the colors don't match.

2. **Main program:**
   - Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
   - Iterates through the objects and uses `move_by_color` to move objects with color '2' to row 9.
   - Iterates again and moves objects with color '8' to row 11.
   - Paints the moved objects onto a blank canvas (created by covering the original objects in `I`).


### **Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  def move_to_row(obj, target_rows):
    c = color(obj)
    return shift(obj, (target_rows.get(c, 0) - uppermost(obj), 0))
  target_rows = {TWO: 9, EIGHT: 11}
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  moved_objs = frozenset(move_to_row(obj, target_rows) for obj in objs)
  return paint(cover(I, merge(objs)), merge(moved_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_to_row` function:**
   - Takes an object and a dictionary `target_rows` as input.
   - Retrieves the target row from the dictionary using the object's color. If the color is not found, it defaults to 0, effectively not moving the object.
   - Calculates the vertical shift and returns the moved object.

2. **Main program:**
   - Defines a dictionary `target_rows` mapping colors to their target rows.
   - Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
   - Iterates through the objects and applies `move_to_row` to each object, using the `target_rows` dictionary.
   - Paints the moved objects onto a blank canvas.


### **Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def conditional_shift(obj, condition, offset):
    return shift(obj, offset) if condition else obj
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  moved_objs = frozenset(conditional_shift(obj, color(obj) == TWO, (9 - uppermost(obj), 0)) for obj in objs)
  moved_objs = frozenset(conditional_shift(obj, color(obj) == EIGHT, (11 - uppermost(obj), 0)) for obj in moved_objs)
  return paint(cover(I, merge(objs)), merge(moved_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`conditional_shift` function:** 
   - Takes an object, a condition, and an offset as input.
   - Shifts the object by the given offset only if the condition is True. 
   - Returns the shifted object or the original object if the condition is False.

2. **Main program:**
   - Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
   - Iterates twice through the objects. In each iteration, it applies `conditional_shift` with the specific color condition (TWO or EIGHT) and the corresponding vertical offset to move them to the target rows (9 or 11).
   - Paints the moved objects onto a blank canvas.

### **Program Version 4:**

**Code:**
```python
def program_v4(I):
  def move_color(I, color, target_row):
    obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
    return paint(cover(I, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  O = move_color(I, TWO, 9)
  O = move_color(O, EIGHT, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_color` function:**
   - Takes the grid, a color, and a target row as input.
   - Extracts the object with the specified `color` from the grid.
   - Calculates the shift required to move the extracted object to the `target_row`.
   - Returns a new grid where the object is moved to the target row.

2. **Main program:**
   - Sequentially calls `move_color` to first move the object with color '2' to row 9 and then the object with color '8' to row 11. 
   - Returns the final modified grid.

### **Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  targets = ((TWO, 9), (EIGHT, 11))
  O = I
  for color, target_row in targets:
    obj = extract(objects(O, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Main program:**
   - Defines a list of tuples `targets`, where each tuple contains a color and its corresponding target row.
   - Iterates through the `targets` list. 
   - For each `color` and `target_row` pair:
     - Extracts the object of that `color`.
     - Moves the object to the `target_row`.
   - Returns the grid with all objects moved to their respective target rows.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic.
