## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects composed of the digits '2' and '8' to specific rows in the grid while maintaining their original shape and relative horizontal position. 

**Input 0:**
* The object composed of '2's is moved from rows 2-4 to rows 9-10.
* The object composed of '8's is moved from rows 10-11 to rows 11-12.

**Input 1:**
* The object composed of '2's is moved from rows 1-4 to rows 3-6.
* The object composed of '8's is moved from rows 5-6 to rows 5-6 (no vertical movement).

**Input 2:**
* The object composed of '2's is moved from rows 7-9 to rows 3-5.
* The object composed of '8's is moved from rows 1-2 to rows 1-2 (no vertical movement).


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_object(grid, color, target_row):
    obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == color)
    return paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  
  O = move_object(I, 2, 9)
  O = move_object(O, 8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each color (2 and 8) and their corresponding target rows. For each color:

1. `objects(grid, T, F, T)` identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. `extract` finds the specific object with the desired `color`.
3. `uppermost` determines the top row of the object.
4. `shift` moves the object vertically to the `target_row`.
5. `cover` removes the original object from the grid.
6. `paint` draws the shifted object at the new location.


**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_to_target(grid, value, target_row):
    objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
    obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == value)
    return paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  
  O = move_to_target(I, 2, 9)
  O = move_to_target(O, 8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but restructures the code slightly by defining a `move_to_target` function that handles both object extraction and movement. 


**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  targets = {2: 9, 8: 11}
  O = I
  for v in targets:
    O = paint(cover(O, extract(objects(O, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == v)), shift(extract(objects(O, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == v), (targets[v] - uppermost(extract(objects(O, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == v)), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a dictionary `targets` to store the target rows for each color. It then iterates through the dictionary, performing the object extraction and movement within the loop. While less readable, it demonstrates a different approach using a loop and dictionary.


**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_object(grid, color, target_row):
    obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), matcher(color, color))
    return paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))

  O = move_object(I, 2, 9)
  O = move_object(O, 8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but replaces the lambda function in `extract` with the `matcher` function for improved readability. 


**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_to_row(obj, target_row):
    return paint(cover(I, obj), shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))

  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj_2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj_8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  
  O = move_to_row(obj_2, 9)
  O = move_to_row(obj_8, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the object extraction and movement into distinct steps for clarity. It first identifies all objects, then extracts the objects of interest, and finally applies the `move_to_row` function to move them to their respective target rows.
