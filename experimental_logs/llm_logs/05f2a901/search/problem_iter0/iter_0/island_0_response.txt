## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to all input grids involves moving objects within the grid towards the bottom-left corner. Objects maintain their shape and color, but their position changes. 

* **Input_0:** The '2' object shifts down by 6 rows and the '8' object shifts down by 2 rows. 
* **Input_1:** The '2' object shifts down by 3 rows and left by 2 columns. The '8' object remains unchanged.
* **Input_2:** The '8' object remains unchanged. The '2' object shifts up by 3 rows.

## Code Generation:

It seems the transformation requires identifying objects and their relative positions to the bottom-left corner. We can use functions like `objects`, `ulcorner`, and `shift` to achieve this. Below are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for obj in objs:
    oi, oj = ulcorner(obj)
    new_i = h - height(obj) + oi
    new_j =  oj
    moved_objs = moved_objs | shift(obj, (new_i - oi, new_j - oj))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and calculate new position:** For each object, we determine its upper-left corner (`ulcorner`), calculate its desired position relative to the bottom-left, and shift it using `shift`.
3. **Paint objects:** Finally, we paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for v in palette(I) - {ZERO}:
    obj = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, c in enumerate(r) if c == v)
    oi, oj = ulcorner(obj)
    new_i = h - height(obj) + oi
    moved_objs = moved_objs | shift(obj, (new_i - oi, 0))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:** This version iterates through each color (except background) and creates an object for that color.
2. **Calculate new position and shift:** Similar to version 1, it calculates the new position and shifts the object.
3. **Paint objects:** It paints the shifted objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for v in palette(I) - {ZERO}:
    obj = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, c in enumerate(r) if c == v)
    oi, _ = ulcorner(obj)
    new_i = h - height(obj) + oi
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (new_i - oi, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors and modify grid:** This version iterates through each color and directly modifies the grid.
2. **Cover and paint:** It covers the original object with background color and then paints the shifted object at the new position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  h = len(I)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          v if (v, (i, j)) in objs
        else ZERO
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) 
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to version 1, it identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Directly construct output:** This version directly constructs the output grid by checking if each cell belongs to an object and placing it at the correct height, filling the rest with background.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for j in range(w):
    for i in range(h - 1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        new_i = h - 1
        while new_i > 0 and O[new_i][j] != ZERO:
          new_i -= 1
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (new_i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns and cells:** This version iterates through each column and then each cell in reverse row order.
2. **Find empty cell and paint:** If a cell contains an object, it finds the first available empty cell in the same column from the bottom and paints the object there.

Each version utilizes a different approach and combination of DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation. You can choose the version that best suits your needs based on readability, efficiency, or other factors.
