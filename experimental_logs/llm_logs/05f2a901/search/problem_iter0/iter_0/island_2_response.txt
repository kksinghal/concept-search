## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts all objects (groups of connected, same-valued cells) to specific rows based on their color values. Here's a breakdown:

* **Color 2:** Objects with color 2 are shifted to occupy rows 8 and 9, starting from the left edge.
* **Color 8:** Objects with color 8 are shifted to occupy rows 10 and 11, starting from the left edge.
* **Background (color 0):** Remains unchanged.

**Note:** The transformation retains the original shape and relative positioning of the objects within their new rows.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj2 = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)
  obj8 = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 8)
  g2 = canvas(0,(14,9))
  g8 = canvas(0,(14,9))
  g2 = paint(g2,shift(merge(obj2),(-6,0)))
  g8 = paint(g8,shift(merge(obj8),(-2,0)))
  O = vconcat(vconcat(cover(I,merge(obj2)),g2),vconcat(cover(I,merge(obj8)),g8))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code first identifies objects of color 2 and 8 using `colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), color)`.
2. **Create Empty Rows:**  It then creates two empty grids (`g2` and `g8`) filled with 0s, representing the target rows for objects with color 2 and 8 respectively.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Objects of each color are merged and shifted to their respective target rows in `g2` and `g8` using `paint(canvas, shift(merge(objects), offset))`.
4. **Combine Grids:** Finally, the original grid `I` (with the objects removed) is vertically concatenated with `g2` and `g8` using `vconcat` to produce the final output `O`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj2 = colorfilter(objs, 2)
  obj8 = colorfilter(objs, 8)
  g = canvas(0, (14,9))
  g = paint(g, shift(merge(obj2), (-6, 0)))
  g = paint(g, shift(merge(obj8), (-2, 0)))
  O = vconcat(cover(I, merge(objs)), g)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** This version first extracts all objects from the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, T)`. 
2. **Filter by Color:** Then, it filters the objects into two groups, `obj2` and `obj8`, based on their color (2 and 8 respectively) using `colorfilter(objects, color)`.
3. **Create Target Grid:** An empty canvas `g` is created with the desired dimensions and filled with background color (0).
4. **Position Objects:** The objects from each color group are merged (`merge(objects)`) and shifted to their specific rows on the target grid `g` using `paint(grid, shift(object, offset))`.
5. **Combine and Return:** Finally, the original objects are removed from the input grid `I` using `cover(grid, objects)`, and the resulting grid is vertically concatenated with the modified target grid `g` to form the output `O` using `vconcat(grid1, grid2)`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for v in (2, 8):
    objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), v)
    obj = merge(objs)
    offset = (-6, 0) if v == 2 else (-2, 0)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** The code initializes an empty grid `O` of the same dimensions as the input grid `I` using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
2. **Iterate Through Colors:** It then iterates through the colors 2 and 8. 
3. **Filter, Merge and Shift:** For each color, it extracts objects of that color, merges them into a single object, and then shifts the merged object to its designated row using a conditional offset based on the color.
4. **Paint to Output:** The shifted object is then painted onto the output grid `O`.
5. **Return Output:** After processing both colors, the final output grid `O` is returned.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(merge(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)), (-6, 0)))
  O = paint(O, shift(merge(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 8)), (-2, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize and Paint Color 2:** The code initializes an empty canvas `O` and immediately paints shifted color 2 objects onto it. 
2. **Paint Color 8:** It then paints shifted color 8 objects onto the existing canvas `O`.
3. **Return Output:** Finally, it returns the modified canvas `O` as the final output.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for color, row in ((2, -6), (8, -2)):
    O = vconcat(cover(O, merge(colorfilter(objects(O, T, F, T), color))), paint(canvas(0, (14,9)), shift(merge(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), color)), (row, 0)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Modify:** This version directly modifies the input grid `I` iteratively for each color and its corresponding row offset.
2. **Remove and Paint:** In each iteration, it covers the existing objects of the current color and then paints them back onto a new canvas at the designated row. 
3. **Vertical Concatenation:** The modified input grid is then vertically concatenated with this new canvas, effectively shifting the objects.
4. **Return Modified Input:** Finally, the modified input grid `O` (which is now the output) is returned.
