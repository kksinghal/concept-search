## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all objects in the grid to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions.  The objects are identified by having a different color than the background color.

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The "2" object is moved to the bottom rows of the grid, leaving the "8" object in its original position.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Both the "2" and "8" objects are moved to the bottom rows of the grid, maintaining their relative positions.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** The "8" object is moved to the second row from the top and "2" object is moved to the bottom rows of the grid, maintaining their relative positions.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = argmax(x1, size) 
  x3 = ulcorner(x2)
  x4 = subtract((len(I),0), shape(x2))
  x5 = add(x3, x4)
  x6 = shift(x2, x5)
  O = paint(cover(I, x2), x6)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identify all objects in the grid.
2. `x2 = argmax(x1, size)`: Find the largest object.
3. `x3 = ulcorner(x2)`: Get the upper-left corner of the largest object.
4. `x4 = subtract((len(I),0), shape(x2))`: Calculate the offset to move the object to the bottom.
5. `x5 = add(x3, x4)`: Calculate the new upper-left corner position for the moved object.
6. `x6 = shift(x2, x5)`: Move the largest object to its new position.
7. `O = paint(cover(I, x2), x6)`: Paint the moved object onto a copy of the input grid where the original object has been removed.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for x2 in x1:
    x3 = ulcorner(x2)
    x4 = subtract((len(I),0), shape(x2))
    x5 = add(x3, x4)
    x6 = shift(x2, x5)
    O = paint(cover(O, x2), x6)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identify all objects in the grid.
2. `O = I`: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input.
3. Iterate through each object `x2` in `x1`:
   - `x3 = ulcorner(x2)`: Get the upper-left corner of the object.
   - `x4 = subtract((len(I),0), shape(x2))`: Calculate the offset to move the object to the bottom.
   - `x5 = add(x3, x4)`: Calculate the new upper-left corner position for the moved object.
   - `x6 = shift(x2, x5)`: Move the object to its new position.
   - `O = paint(cover(O, x2), x6)`: Paint the moved object onto the output grid, replacing its previous position.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = sorted(x1, key=lambda x: ulcorner(x)[0])
  O = I
  for x3 in x2:
    x4 = ulcorner(x3)
    x5 = subtract((len(I),0), shape(x3))
    x6 = add(x4, x5)
    x7 = shift(x3, x6)
    O = paint(cover(O, x3), x7)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 2 but sorts the objects by their vertical position before moving them. This ensures that objects are moved in a top-down order, preventing overlaps.

1. `x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identify all objects in the grid.
2. `x2 = sorted(x1, key=lambda x: ulcorner(x)[0])`: Sort objects by their upper-left corner's row index.
3. `O = I`: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input.
4. Iterate through each object `x3` in `x2`:
   - `x4 = ulcorner(x3)`: Get the upper-left corner of the object.
   - `x5 = subtract((len(I),0), shape(x3))`: Calculate the offset to move the object to the bottom.
   - `x6 = add(x4, x5)`: Calculate the new upper-left corner position for the moved object.
   - `x7 = shift(x3, x6)`: Move the object to its new position.
   - `O = paint(cover(O, x3), x7)`: Paint the moved object onto the output grid, replacing its previous position.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for x2 in x1:
    x3 = ofcolor(I, x2)
    x4 = ulcorner(x3)
    x5 = subtract((len(I),0), shape(x3))
    x6 = add(x4, x5)
    x7 = shift(x3, x6)
    O = paint(O, recolor(x2, x7))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the color palette to iterate through objects and places them on a blank canvas of the background color.

1. `x1 = palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}`: Get the set of colors used in the grid excluding the background color.
2. `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`: Create a blank canvas with the background color and the same dimensions as the input.
3. Iterate through each color `x2` in `x1`:
   - `x3 = ofcolor(I, x2)`: Get the indices of cells with the current color.
   - `x4 = ulcorner(x3)`: Get the upper-left corner of the current object.
   - `x5 = subtract((len(I),0), shape(x3))`: Calculate the offset to move the object to the bottom.
   - `x6 = add(x4, x5)`: Calculate the new upper-left corner position for the moved object.
   - `x7 = shift(x3, x6)`: Move the object's indices to the new position.
   - `O = paint(O, recolor(x2, x7))`: Paint the moved object onto the canvas with the corresponding color.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = lambda x: subtract((len(I), 0), shape(x))
  x3 = lambda x: shift(x, add(ulcorner(x), x2(x)))
  O = I
  for x4 in x1:
    O = paint(cover(O, x4), x3(x4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses lambda functions to improve code readability and conciseness. 

1. `x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identify all objects in the grid.
2. `x2 = lambda x: subtract((len(I), 0), shape(x))`: Lambda function to calculate the offset for moving an object to the bottom.
3. `x3 = lambda x: shift(x, add(ulcorner(x), x2(x)))`: Lambda function to move an object to the bottom, combining the offset calculation and shifting.
4. `O = I`: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input.
5. Iterate through each object `x4` in `x1`:
   - `O = paint(cover(O, x4), x3(x4))`: Paint the moved object (using the `x3` lambda function) onto the output grid, replacing its previous position.
