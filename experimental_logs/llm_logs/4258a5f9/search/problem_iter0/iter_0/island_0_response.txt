## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the locations of digit '5' in the input grid and creating 3x3 squares centered at those locations in the output grid. The squares are filled with the digit '1', except for the center cell which retains the original digit '5'. 

**Example:**

Input Grid:
```
0 0 0 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0
```

Output Grid:
```
0 0 1 1 1
0 0 1 5 1
0 0 1 1 1
```

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  fives = ofcolor(I, 5)
  squares = mapply(lambda loc: backdrop(shift({(0, (1,1))}, loc)), totuple(fives))
  ones = difference(squares, fives)
  O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 1, ones)
  return fill(O, 5, fives) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5' locations:** `fives = ofcolor(I, 5)` finds the indices of all cells containing '5'.
2. **Create 3x3 square indices:**  
    - `{(0, (1,1))}` creates a dummy object with one cell at the center.
    - `shift({(0, (1,1))}, loc)` shifts this dummy object to each '5' location. 
    - `backdrop(...)` generates the indices of the 3x3 square around the shifted center.
    - `mapply(...)` applies this process to all '5' locations and merges the results.
3. **Get indices for '1's:** `ones = difference(squares, fives)` removes the '5' indices from the square indices.
4. **Generate output grid:**
    - `O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 1, ones)` creates a blank grid of the same size as the input and fills '1's at the calculated indices.
    - `return fill(O, 5, fives)` fills '5's at their original positions.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(1, height(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, width(I)-1):
      if I[i][j] == 5:
        O = fill(O, 1, backdrop({(0, (i,j))}))
  return fill(O, 5, ofcolor(I, 5))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output grid:** `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a blank grid of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate and fill:**
    - Nested loops iterate through the inner cells of the grid (excluding the borders).
    - If a '5' is found, `fill(O, 1, backdrop({(0, (i,j))}))` fills a 3x3 square of '1's centered at the '5' location.
3. **Fill '5's:** `return fill(O, 5, ofcolor(I, 5))` fills '5's at their original positions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)
  shifted_squares = mfilter(lambda loc: shift(backdrop({(0,(1,1))}), loc), five_indices)
  ones_indices = difference(shifted_squares, five_indices)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = fill(O, 1, ones_indices)
  return fill(O, 5, five_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5' locations:** `five_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)` gets indices of '5's.
2. **Generate square indices:** 
    - `backdrop({(0,(1,1))})` creates indices for a 3x3 square.
    - `shift(...)` shifts the square to each '5' location.
    - `mfilter(...)` applies shifting to all '5' locations and merges results.
3. **Identify '1' locations:** `ones_indices = difference(shifted_squares, five_indices)` removes '5' indices.
4. **Generate output:**
    - `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a blank grid.
    - `O = fill(O, 1, ones_indices)` fills '1's at calculated locations.
    - `return fill(O, 5, five_indices)` fills '5's at their original locations.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if I[i][j] == 5:
      for x in range(max(0, i-1), min(i+2, height(I))):
        for y in range(max(0, j-1), min(j+2, width(I))):
          if (x, y) != (i, j):
            O = fill(O, 1, {(0,(x,y))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** Nested loops go through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check for '5':** If a cell contains '5', iterate through its 3x3 neighborhood.
3. **Fill with '1's:**  Fill each neighboring cell with '1' except the center.
4. **Return modified grid:** The modified input grid becomes the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  five_locations = ofcolor(I, 5)
  squares = apply(lambda loc: backdrop(shift({(0, (1, 1))}, loc)), five_locations)
  all_ones_indices =  merge(squares)
  ones_indices = difference(all_ones_indices, five_locations)
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, 1, ones_indices)
  return fill(output_grid, 5, five_locations)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' locations:** `five_locations = ofcolor(I, 5)` identifies indices of '5's.
2. **Generate square indices:**
    - `{(0, (1, 1))}` is a dummy object representing the center of a 3x3 square.
    - `shift(...)` moves the dummy object to each '5' location.
    - `backdrop(...)` gets indices for the 3x3 square at each shifted location.
    - `apply(...)` applies this to all '5' locations.
3. **Identify '1' locations:**
    - `all_ones_indices =  merge(squares)` combines all square indices.
    - `ones_indices = difference(all_ones_indices, five_locations)` removes '5' indices.
4. **Generate output:**
    - `output_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a blank output grid.
    - `output_grid = fill(output_grid, 1, ones_indices)` fills '1's at their locations.
    - `return fill(output_grid, 5, five_locations)` places '5's back in their original positions. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL functions, showcasing diverse logic and function combinations.
