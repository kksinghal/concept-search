## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all the objects consisting of the digit '5' towards the center of the grid. However, the movement is restricted to one step in each direction per transformation. This means an object can move at most one cell vertically and one cell horizontally in each step. The movement stops when the object's center of mass aligns with either the vertical or horizontal center line of the grid.

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's analyze Input_1 and Output_1:

- There are three '5' objects: one at the top, one on the left, and one combined object at the bottom left. 
- The top object moves one cell down and stops as its center of mass aligns with the vertical center line. 
- The left object moves one cell right and stops for the same reason.
- The bottom left object moves one cell up and one cell right.

## Program Versions & Explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 5) # Extract '5' objects
  grid_center = centerofmass(asindices(I)) # Calculate grid center
  moved_fives = frozenset()
  for obj in fives:
    obj_center = centerofmass(obj)
    h_shift = 0 if abs(grid_center[1] - obj_center[1]) <= 1 else sign(grid_center[1] - obj_center[1])
    v_shift = 0 if abs(grid_center[0] - obj_center[0]) <= 1 else sign(grid_center[0] - obj_center[0])
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (v_shift, h_shift))
    moved_fives = moved_fives | {shifted_obj}
  O = paint(cover(I, fives), moved_fives)  # Update grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '5' Objects:** Identify and extract all objects formed by the digit '5'.
2. **Calculate Centers:** Determine the center of the grid and the center of each '5' object.
3. **Calculate Shift:** Calculate the horizontal and vertical shift for each object. If the object's center is already within one unit distance from the grid's center line (horizontally or vertically), the shift is 0. Otherwise, the shift is 1 or -1 depending on the object's position relative to the grid's center.
4. **Shift Objects:** Move each object by the calculated shift.
5. **Update Grid:** Clear the original positions of the '5' objects and paint the shifted objects onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = toindices(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 5)) # Indices of '5's
  center_i, center_j = centerofmass(asindices(I)) # Grid center
  moved_fives = frozenset((
    center_i if abs(center_i - i) <= 1 else i + sign(center_i - i), 
    center_j if abs(center_j - j) <= 1 else j + sign(center_j - j)
  ) for i, j in fives) # Move indices, stop at center line
  O = fill(fill(I, 0, fives), 5, moved_fives) # Update grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' Indices:** Identify the indices of all cells containing the digit '5'.
2. **Calculate Grid Center:** Determine the center of the grid.
3. **Calculate New Indices:**  For each '5' index, calculate the new index based on its proximity to the grid's center lines. If the index is within one unit distance from the center line (horizontally or vertically), it's set to the center line's index. Otherwise, it's moved one step closer to the center line.
4. **Update Grid:**  Clear the original '5' positions and fill the new indices with '5'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 5) # '5' objects
  grid_center = centerofmass(asindices(I)) # Grid center
  moved_fives = frozenset(
    recolor(5, normalize(shift(obj, (
      0 if abs(grid_center[0] - centerofmass(obj)[0]) <= 1 else sign(grid_center[0] - centerofmass(obj)[0]),
      0 if abs(grid_center[1] - centerofmass(obj)[1]) <= 1 else sign(grid_center[1] - centerofmass(obj)[1])
    )))) for obj in fives) # Move, normalize, recolor
  O = paint(cover(I, fives), moved_fives) # Update grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '5' Objects:** Extract all objects consisting of '5's.
2. **Calculate Grid Center:** Determine the grid's center.
3. **Move, Normalize, Recolor:** For each '5' object:
   - Calculate the shift based on its center's proximity to the grid's center.
   - Shift the object.
   - Normalize the shifted object to ensure the upper left corner starts at the origin.
   - Recolor the normalized object to ensure it's still a '5' object.
4. **Update Grid:** Cover the original '5' objects and paint the moved and recolored objects onto the grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = toindices(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 5)) # Find all '5' indices
  center_i, center_j = centerofmass(asindices(I)) # Calculate grid center
  moved_fives = set() 
  for i, j in fives:
    new_i = center_i if abs(center_i - i) <= 1 else i + sign(center_i - i)
    new_j = center_j if abs(center_j - j) <= 1 else j + sign(center_j - j)
    moved_fives.add((new_i, new_j)) # Add shifted index to the set 
  O = fill(fill(I, 0, fives), 5, frozenset(moved_fives)) # Update grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Find '5' Indices:**  Find the indices of all '5' cells.
2. **Calculate Grid Center:** Determine the center of the grid.
3. **Calculate and Store New Indices:**  Iterate through each '5' index and calculate the new index based on its distance from the center lines. Store the new indices in a set.
4. **Update Grid:** Clear the original '5' positions and fill the new indices from the set with '5'.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Extract all objects
  fives = colorfilter(objs, 5)  # Filter for '5' objects
  center_i, center_j = centerofmass(asindices(I)) # Grid center
  moved_fives = frozenset()
  for obj in fives:
    obj_center = centerofmass(obj)
    h_shift =  0 if abs(grid_center[1] - obj_center[1]) <= 1 else sign(grid_center[1] - obj_center[1])
    v_shift = 0 if abs(grid_center[0] - obj_center[0]) <= 1 else sign(grid_center[0] - obj_center[0])
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (v_shift, h_shift)) # Move each object, stop at center line
    moved_fives = moved_fives | {shifted_obj}
  O = paint(cover(I, fives), moved_fives) # Update grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Filter:**  Extract all objects from the grid and then filter to keep only the objects consisting of the digit '5'.
2. **Calculate Centers:** Determine the grid's center and the center of each '5' object.
3. **Calculate Shift and Move:** For each '5' object, calculate the horizontal and vertical shift needed to move it towards the center. The shift is limited to one unit in each direction and stops when the object's center aligns with either the horizontal or vertical center line of the grid.
4. **Update the Grid:**  Remove the original '5' objects from the grid and paint the moved objects in their new positions.
