## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background objects (2s and 5s in this case) to the top of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions.  

* **Input 0:** The 5s form three distinct objects, and each object is moved upwards until it reaches the top of the grid. The 2s remain in their position as they are already at the top.
* **Input 1:** Similar to input 0, the 5s move up, but this time they stack on top of each other in a specific order: rightmost object on top, leftmost object at the bottom. 
* **Input 2:** The 5s again move upwards and stack, but this time they are interspersed with the existing 2s.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_2d_gravity(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    moved_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        upper = uppermost(obj)
        while upper > 0:
            obj = shift(obj, (-1, 0))
            upper -= 1
        moved_objs = insert(obj, moved_objs)
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, False, False, True)` identifies all non-background connected components as individual objects.
2. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates over each object. For each object:
   -  `uppermost(obj)` identifies the row index of the uppermost cell.
   -  The `while` loop shifts the object upwards (`shift(obj, (-1, 0))`) until it reaches the top row (`upper > 0`).
   -  The shifted object is added to the `moved_objs` set.
3. **Construct Output:** A blank canvas (`canvas(0, shape(I))`) of the same size as the input is created, and the moved objects are painted onto it (`paint(canvas(...), moved_objs)`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_2d_gravity(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(width(I)):
        for i in range(1, height(I)):
            if index(O, (i, j)) != 0 and index(O, (i - 1, j)) == 0:
                k = i
                while k > 0 and index(O, (k - 1, j)) == 0:
                    k -= 1
                O = fill(O, 0, {(i, j)})
                O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(k, j)})
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Columns:** The code iterates through each column (`j`) of the grid.
2. **Find and Move Non-Zero Values:** Within each column, it iterates through rows (`i`) from top to bottom. 
   -  If a non-zero value is found (`index(O, (i, j)) != 0`) and the cell above is empty (`index(O, (i - 1, j)) == 0`):
     -  It finds the highest empty cell (`k`) in that column.
     -  The original non-zero value is cleared (`fill(O, 0, {(i, j)})`).
     -  The value from the input grid (`index(I, (i, j))`) is placed at the found empty cell (`fill(O, ..., {(k, j)})`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_2d_gravity(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for j in range(width(I)):
        non_zeros = [(i, index(I, (i, j))) for i in range(height(I)) if index(I, (i, j)) != 0]
        for k, (i, v) in enumerate(non_zeros):
            O = fill(O, v, {(k, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** A new grid `O` is initialized with all 0s, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate Through Columns:** It iterates through each column (`j`).
3. **Collect Non-Zero Values:** For every column, it collects all non-zero values along with their row indices in the `non_zeros` list.
4. **Place Non-Zero Values:** It iterates through the `non_zeros` list and places each value `v` at the corresponding row `k` in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_2d_gravity(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    upper_left = ulcorner(obj)
    new_obj = shift(obj, (-upper_left[0], 0)) 
    moved_objs = insert(new_obj, moved_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies non-background objects.
2. **Calculate Shift:** Instead of iteratively shifting, it calculates the required upward shift using `-upper_left[0]`, moving each object directly to the top. 
3. **Construct Output:** Similar to Version 1, it creates a blank canvas and paints the shifted objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_2d_gravity(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
        i = uppermost(obj)
        while i > 0 and index(O, (i - 1, leftmost(obj))) == 0:
            O = move(O, obj, (-1, 0))
            i -= 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Move Directly:** This version directly moves objects on the grid `O`.
2. **Find Empty Space and Move:** For each object, it iterates upwards as long as the cell above the object's leftmost point is empty (`index(O, (i - 1, leftmost(obj))) == 0`).
3. **Move Using `move` Function:**  The `move(O, obj, (-1, 0))` function efficiently handles moving the object one step up. 


These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation. They utilize different DSL functions and strategies, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL.
