## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves two steps:

1. **Moving the "5" objects:** All objects made of the digit "5" are moved downwards by 3 units. 
2. **Removing overflowing objects:** If any part of the "5" object moves beyond the bottom edge of the grid, it is removed entirely from the output.

**Example:**

In Input_1, the vertical "5" object is shifted down by 3 units. Notice that the bottom two "5"s are removed in the output because they would have extended past the grid's bottom edge. 


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  fives = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
  moved_fives = shift(fives, (3, 0))
  h = height(I)
  cropped_fives = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in moved_fives if i < h)
  return paint(replace(I, 5, 0), cropped_fives)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fives = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)`:**  Extracts the object made of "5"s from the input grid `I`.
2. **`moved_fives = shift(fives, (3, 0))`:** Shifts the extracted "5" object downwards by 3 units.
3. **`h = height(I)`:** Obtains the height of the input grid.
4. **`cropped_fives = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in moved_fives if i < h)`:** Creates a new object `cropped_fives` containing only the cells of `moved_fives` whose row index `i` is within the bounds of the grid. This effectively removes overflowing parts of the object.
5. **`return paint(replace(I, 5, 0), cropped_fives)`:**  Replaces all occurrences of "5" in the input grid with "0" and then paints the `cropped_fives` object onto the grid, resulting in the final output.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        0 if v == 5 else
        I[(i - 3) % height(I)][j] if 0 <= (i - 3)  < height(I) else 0
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`:** Iterates through each row `row` of the input grid `I` with its corresponding row index `i`.
2. **`for j, v in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates through each value `v` in the current row with its corresponding column index `j`.
3. **`0 if v == 5 else ...`:**  If the current value `v` is "5", replaces it with "0". Otherwise, proceeds to the next condition.
4. **`I[(i - 3) % height(I)][j] if 0 <= (i - 3)  < height(I) else 0`:**  Calculates the source row index `(i - 3) % height(I)` for shifting the "5"s downwards. If the source row index is within the grid's bounds, takes the value from that location in the input grid. Otherwise, uses "0" to indicate removal of overflowing elements.
5. **`tuple(tuple(...))`:** Constructs and returns the output grid based on the transformed values.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  h = height(I)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        I[i][j] if I[i][j] != 5 else 
        I[(i - 3) % h][j] if 0 <= (i - 3) < h else 0 
        for j in range(width(I))
      ) for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 2, but it rearranges the conditional logic for clarity:

1.  **`I[i][j] if I[i][j] != 5 else ...`**: Keeps the current cell value if it is not "5". Otherwise, proceeds to the next condition.
2. **`I[(i - 3) % h][j] if 0 <= (i - 3) < h else 0`**: This part remains the same, handling the downward shift and removal of overflowing "5"s.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  fives = ofcolor(I, 5)
  shifted_fives = frozenset(((i + 3) % height(I), j) for i, j in fives if (i + 3) < height(I))
  return fill(replace(I, 5, 0), 5, shifted_fives)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fives = ofcolor(I, 5)`:** Gets the indices of all "5"s in the input grid.
2. **`shifted_fives = frozenset(((i + 3) % height(I), j) for i, j in fives if (i + 3) < height(I))`:** Calculates the new indices for the "5"s after the downward shift, keeping only those within the grid's bounds.
3. **`return fill(replace(I, 5, 0), 5, shifted_fives)`:** Replaces all "5"s in the input grid with "0" and then fills the `shifted_fives` indices with "5" to create the output.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  moved_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (3, 0)) if color(obj) == 5 else obj for obj in objs)
  h = height(I)
  cropped_objs = frozenset(frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i < h) for obj in moved_objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(cropped_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`moved_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (3, 0)) if color(obj) == 5 else obj for obj in objs)`:**  Shifts only the objects made of "5" downwards by 3 units, leaving other objects unchanged.
3. **`h = height(I)`:** Obtains the height of the input grid.
4. **`cropped_objs = frozenset(frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i < h) for obj in moved_objs)`:** Creates new objects from `moved_objs`, removing any cell that falls outside the grid's bounds. 
5. **`return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(cropped_objs))`:**  Creates a blank canvas, merges all the cropped objects onto it, and returns the resulting grid as the output. 

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different DSL function combinations and logic.
