## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by the digit '5' and involves three steps:

1. **Vertical Compression:** All '5' objects are moved upwards until they encounter a non-background cell or reach the top of the grid.
2. **Centering:** The vertically compressed '5' objects are then horizontally centered within their row. 
3. **Background Preservation:** All other digits (non-'5' digits) retain their original positions and are unaffected by the transformation. 

Let's illustrate this with Input_1:

**Input_1:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 5 0
5 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 5 5
5 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 5 5
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 5 0
0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

**Output_1 (After Transformation):**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

This pattern holds for all provided input-output pairs.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program (`Program_to_be_generated`) in the provided DSL, along with explanations for their logic:

**Program Version 1: Object Manipulation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 5:
      upper = uppermost(obj)
      while upper > 0 and index(I, (upper - 1, leftmost(obj))) == bg:
        upper -= 1
      obj = shift(obj, (upper - uppermost(obj), 0))
      left_shift = (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2
      obj = shift(obj, (0, left_shift))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
  O = new_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid (`I`).
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create an empty grid (`new_grid`) with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
3.  **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object:
    *   **Identify '5' Objects:** If the object's color is '5', proceed with the transformation.
    *   **Vertical Compression:** Move the object upwards until it encounters a non-background cell or reaches the top.
    *   **Horizontal Centering:** Calculate the required shift to center the object horizontally and apply it.
    *   **Paint:** Paint the transformed object onto the `new_grid`.
4.  **Return Output:** Return the `new_grid` as the final output (`O`).

**Program Version 2: Row-wise Processing**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = ()
    for row in I:
        if 5 in row:
            five_obj = frozenset({(5, (i, j)) for i, v in enumerate(row) if v == 5})
            left_shift = (len(row) - width(five_obj)) // 2
            new_row = list(row)
            for j in range(len(row)):
                if row[j] == 5:
                    new_row[j] = 0
                if j >= left_shift and j < left_shift + width(five_obj):
                    new_row[j] = 5
            O += (tuple(new_row),)
        else:
            O += (row,)
    return O

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row in the input grid (`I`).
2.  **Identify '5' Rows:** Check if the digit '5' is present in the current row.
3.  **Process '5' Row:** If a '5' is found:
    *   Create a temporary object representing the '5's in the row.
    *   Calculate the horizontal shift needed for centering.
    *   Create a new row, initially filled like the original.
    *   Replace the original '5' positions with the background color.
    *   Fill the new, centered positions with the digit '5'.
    *   Add the processed row to the output grid (`O`).
4.  **Preserve Other Rows:** If no '5' is found, add the row directly to the output grid (`O`).
5.  **Return Output:** Return the constructed output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 3: Using `extract` and `shift`**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == 5:
            O = paint(O, shift(extract(objs, lambda x: color(x) == 5), (uppermost(I) - uppermost(obj), (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2)))
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** Get all objects in the input grid (`I`).
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a blank output grid (`O`) of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3.  **Iterate and Process Objects:** For each object (`obj`) in the input:
    *   **'5' Objects:** If the object's color is '5':
        *   Find the '5' object and shift it:  It's moved upwards to the top and horizontally centered using `shift`.
        *   Paint the shifted object onto the output grid (`O`).
    *   **Other Objects:**  If the object's color is not '5':
        *   Paint the object directly onto the output grid (`O`) without any changes.
4.  **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 4: Leveraging `occurrences` Function**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    five_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 5)
    occurrences_indices = occurrences(I, five_obj)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for i, j in occurrences_indices:
        O = paint(O, shift(five_obj, (uppermost(I) - i, (width(I) - width(five_obj)) // 2)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify '5' Object:** Extract the object made of '5's from the input grid (`I`).
2.  **Find Occurrences:** Determine the positions (upper-left corner indices) of all occurrences of the '5' object in the grid.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create an empty output grid (`O`) with the input's dimensions, filled with the background color.
4.  **Process Occurrences:** Loop through the identified occurrences:
    *   For each occurrence, shift the '5' object to the top of the grid and center it horizontally.
    *   Paint the shifted object onto the output grid (`O`).
5.  **Return Output:** Return the final output grid (`O`) with the transformed '5' objects.

**Program Version 5: Combining `hconcat` and `vsplit`**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    five_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 5)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    empty_grid = canvas(bg, (height(I) // 2, width(I)))
    centered_five = shift(five_obj, (0, (width(I) - width(five_obj)) // 2))
    O = vconcat(paint(empty_grid, centered_five), bottomhalf(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify '5' Object:** Find and isolate the object made of '5's in the input grid (`I`).
2.  **Create Components:**
    *   Generate an empty grid (`empty_grid`) representing the top half of the output.
    *   Horizontally center the '5' object (`centered_five`).
3.  **Assemble Output:**
    *   Combine the centered '5' object with the `empty_grid`.
    *   Vertically concatenate this result with the bottom half of the input grid (`I`).
4.  **Return Output:** Return the assembled grid (`O`) as the final output.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation within the constraints of the provided DSL. Each leverages different combinations of functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning problems.
