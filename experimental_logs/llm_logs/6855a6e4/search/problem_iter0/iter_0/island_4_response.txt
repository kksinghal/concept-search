## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (5 in this case), moving them to a different location, and then filling the original location of the object with the background color (0).

**Input_0:** The object '5' is moved from the top and bottom edges to the center.

**Input_1:** The object '5' is moved from the left and right edges to the center, filling the space between the '2' objects.

**Input_2:** The object '5' is moved from the top, bottom, left, and right edges to the center, forming a cross shape.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 5))
  center_i = height(I) // 2
  center_j = width(I) // 2
  offset = subtract((center_i, center_j), centerofmass(obj))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(obj, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify the object:** `colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 5)` finds all objects with color '5', and `first` selects the first object.
2. **Calculate the offset:** `centerofmass(obj)` finds the center of the object, `(center_i, center_j)` defines the grid's center, and `subtract` calculates the offset to move the object to the center.
3. **Move and paint:** `cover(I, obj)` removes the object from the original grid, `shift(obj, offset)` moves the object to the new location, and `paint` paints the moved object onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)
  center_loc = (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2)
  O = I
  for loc in obj_indices:
    O = paint(cover(O, {(5, loc)}), {(5, center_loc)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find object locations:** `ofcolor(I, 5)` returns indices of all cells with color '5'.
2. **Iterate and move:** The code iterates through each location in `obj_indices`. For each location, it removes the cell with color '5' and paints a new cell with color '5' at the center location.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = normalize(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 5)))
  center_offset = subtract((height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2), ulcorner(obj))
  O = paint(cover(I, shift(obj, center_offset)), shift(obj, center_offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Normalize the object:** `normalize(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 5)))` finds the object with color '5' and normalizes its position.
2. **Calculate offset to center:** `subtract` calculates the offset needed to move the normalized object to the center of the grid.
3. **Move and paint:** Similar to version 1, this part moves the normalized object to the center and paints it onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  five_indices = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 5)))
  center_i, center_j = height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if (i, j) in five_indices:
      O = paint(O, {(5, (center_i, center_j))})
    else:
      O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Get indices of '5':** `toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 5)))` finds the indices of cells in the object with color '5'.
2. **Create an empty canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a new grid with the background color and the same shape as the input.
3. **Iterate and paint:** The code iterates through each cell in the input grid. If the cell index is present in `five_indices`, it paints a cell with color '5' at the center of the output grid. Otherwise, it paints the cell from the input grid onto the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 5))
  O = I
  for v, (i, j) in obj:
    O = paint(cover(O, {(v, (i, j))}), {(v, (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find the object:** `first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 5))` identifies the object with color '5'.
2. **Iterate and move:** The code iterates through each cell in the object. For each cell, it removes the cell from its original position and paints it at the center of the grid.

These are just a few examples. You can use other functions from the DSL to create different programs for the same transformation.
