## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation moves the object composed of '5's three rows down, placing it above the object composed of '2's. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The transformation involves two steps:
1. The object composed of '5's is moved three rows down, placing it below the object composed of '2's.
2.  Two new '5's are added, flanking the central column of the object composed of '2's. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:** This transformation is similar to Input_1 to Output_1, with the object composed of '5's moved three rows down and placed below the object composed of '2's.  However, instead of adding two new '5's, five new '5's are added to form a horizontal line directly below the object composed of '2's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### **Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = asobject(replace(I, 2, 0))
  twos = asobject(replace(I, 5, 0))
  moved_fives = shift(fives, (3, 0)) 
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_fives) | twos
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate Objects:** We isolate the objects composed of '5's and '2's using `asobject` and `replace`.  
2. **Shift '5's:** The '5' object is shifted down three rows using `shift`.
3. **Combine Objects:** A blank canvas is created with `canvas`, then the shifted '5' object and the '2' object are painted onto it using `paint` and combined with `|`.

### **Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  fives = colorfilter(objs, 5)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)
  moved_fives = frozenset({shift(obj, (3, 0)) for obj in fives})
  return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_fives), twos)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The `objects` function identifies distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Objects:**  The '5' and '2' objects are filtered using `colorfilter`.
3. **Shift '5's:**  Each object in the 'fives' set is shifted down three rows using a set comprehension and `shift`.
4. **Combine Objects:** Similar to version 1, a blank canvas is used, and the objects are painted onto it.

### **Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_fives = shift(asobject(replace(I, 2, 0)), (3, 0))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_fives) | asobject(replace(I, 5, 0))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate and Shift '5's:**  The '5' object is isolated and shifted in a single line using `asobject`, `replace`, and `shift`.
2. **Isolate '2's:** The '2' object is isolated using `asobject` and `replace`.
3. **Combine Objects:** Similar to previous versions, a blank canvas is used, and the transformed objects are painted onto it.

### **Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)
  twos = asobject(replace(I, 5, 0))
  shifted_fives = recolor(5, shift(fives_indices, (3, 0)))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_fives) | twos
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' Indices:**  The indices of all '5's are found using `ofcolor`.
2. **Isolate '2's:** The '2' object is isolated using `asobject` and `replace`.
3. **Shift and Recolor:**  The '5' indices are shifted, then the color is reapplied using `recolor`. 
4. **Combine Objects:**  The objects are combined onto a blank canvas as in previous versions.

### **Program Version 5:**

**Code:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
  twos = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  moved_fives = shift(fives, (3, 0))
  return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_fives), twos)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  The '5' and '2' objects are extracted from the list of all objects using `extract` and a lambda function to check the object's color.
2. **Shift '5's:**  The '5' object is shifted down three rows using `shift`.
3. **Combine Objects:** Similar to previous versions, the shifted '5' object and the '2' object are painted onto a blank canvas.
