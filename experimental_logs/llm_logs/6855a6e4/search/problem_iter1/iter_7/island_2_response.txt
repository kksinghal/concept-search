## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying all objects made of the digit '5', calculating how far their center of mass is from the middle row of the grid, and then shifting them vertically to align their center of mass with the middle row. All other objects remain untouched.

**Example:**

- **Input_0:** The '5' object is initially located across rows 1, 2, 13, and 14. Its center of mass is calculated, and then the object is shifted upwards to align with the middle row (row 7). 
- **Input_1:** The '5' object, initially spread across rows 7, 8, 9, and 10, is shifted upwards to align its center of mass with the middle row.
- **Input_2:** Similar to the previous examples, the '5' object is shifted upwards to align with the middle row.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, inspired by the provided examples but utilizing different logic and function combinations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  five_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, False, True, True), 5)
  other_objs = difference(objects(I, False, True, True), five_objs)
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in five_objs:
    shift_amount = (height(I) // 2) - centerofmass(obj)[0]
    moved_objs = moved_objs.union(shift(obj, (shift_amount, 0)))
  return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), other_objs), moved_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Extract all objects made of '5' (`five_objs`) and the remaining objects (`other_objs`).
2. **Calculate shift:** For each '5' object, calculate the vertical shift needed to align its center of mass with the middle row.
3. **Shift objects:** Shift each '5' object by the calculated amount.
4. **Reconstruct grid:** Create a blank canvas, paint the non-'5' objects, and then paint the shifted '5' objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  return paint(
      cover(I, ofcolor(I, 5)),  
      frozenset({(v, (i + (height(I) // 2) - centerofmass(obj)[0], j))
                for v, (i, j) in obj 
                if v == 5}
                for obj in objects(I, False, True, True))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Remove '5's:** Erase all cells containing '5' from the input grid.
2. **Shift and paint:** For each object, if it contains '5', shift all its cells vertically to align with the middle row and paint them onto the erased grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  return cellwise(
      I,
      paint(
          canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
          frozenset({(v, (i + (height(I) // 2) - centerofmass(obj)[0], j))
                  for v, (i, j) in obj 
                  if v == 5}
                  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True))
      ),
      I
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create target grid:** Construct a grid identical to the input but with all '5's moved to align with the middle row.
2. **Merge grids:** Use `cellwise` to merge the input and target grids, preserving cells from the input grid unless they correspond to a shifted '5' in the target grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)
  shift_amount = (height(I) // 2) - centerofmass(five_indices)[0]
  return paint(
      cover(I, five_indices),
      shift(recolor(5, five_indices), (shift_amount, 0))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' indices:** Locate all indices containing '5' in the input grid.
2. **Calculate shift:** Determine the vertical shift required to center the '5' indices.
3. **Shift and paint:** Erase the original '5's, shift the collected indices, recolor them to '5', and paint them onto the grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  five_obj = extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: 5 in palette(obj))
  shift_amount = (height(I) // 2) - centerofmass(five_obj)[0]
  return paint(
      cover(I, five_obj),
      shift(five_obj, (shift_amount, 0))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '5' object:** Isolate the object containing the digit '5'.
2. **Calculate and apply shift:** Calculate the vertical shift needed to center this object and apply it. 
3. **Reconstruct grid:** Erase the original object and paint the shifted object onto the grid.
