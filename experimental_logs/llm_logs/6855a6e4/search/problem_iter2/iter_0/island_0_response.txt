## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves these key steps:

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 3. Each cell in the input grid is replaced by a 3x3 block of cells in the output grid, maintaining the original value.
2. **Recoloring:**  All occurrences of the digit '8' in the upscaled grid are replaced with the digit '5'.
3. **Padding:** The upscaled and recolored grid is then padded with a border of '0's to reach a final size of 15x15.

**Let's illustrate with Input_0:**

```
Input_0:
2 0 0 0 2
2 8 2 2 2 

1. Upscaling (x3):
2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 

2. Recoloring (8 -> 5):
2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 5 5 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 5 5 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 5 5 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 

3. Padding (with 0s):
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Direct Approach):**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3) 
  x2 = replace(x1, 8, 5)
  O = canvas(0, (15, 15))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `x1 = upscale(I, 3)`: Upscales the input grid `I` by a factor of 3.
2.  `x2 = replace(x1, 8, 5)`: Replaces all occurrences of '8' in `x1` with '5'.
3. `O = canvas(0, (15, 15))`: Creates a 15x15 canvas filled with '0's.
4. `return O`: Returns the final padded and transformed grid `O`.

**Version 2 (Using `fill` for Padding):**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3)
  x2 = replace(x1, 8, 5)
  x3 = shape(x2)
  x4 = subtract((15, 15), x3)
  O = fill(canvas(0, (15, 15)), x2, backdrop(shift(asobject(x2), divide(x4, 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Steps 1-2 are identical to Version 1.
2.  `x3 = shape(x2)`: Gets the dimensions of the upscaled and recolored grid.
3.  `x4 = subtract((15, 15), x3)`: Calculates the padding needed on each side.
4.  `O = fill(...)`: Creates a 15x15 canvas, then fills the center with `x2` by calculating its position and backdrop after shifting. 

**Version 3 (Combining Upscaling and Recoloring):**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (15, 15))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      O = fill(O, 5 if val == 8 else val, backdrop(((i*3, j*3), (i*3+2, j*3+2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `O = canvas(0, (15, 15))`: Creates a 15x15 canvas filled with '0's.
2. The nested loops iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3.  For each cell, it fills a 3x3 block on the output grid with the upscaled value, replacing '8' with '5' during the process.

**Version 4 (Functional Approach with `apply`):**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = lambda v: 5 if v == 8 else v
  x2 = apply(lambda r: tuple(x1(v) for v in r), I)
  x3 = upscale(x2, 3)
  O = canvas(0, (15, 15))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `x1 = lambda v: 5 if v == 8 else v`: Defines a lambda function to replace '8' with '5'.
2.  `x2 = apply(lambda r: tuple(x1(v) for v in r), I)`: Applies the recoloring logic (`x1`) to each row of the input grid using `apply`.
3.  `x3 = upscale(x2, 3)`: Upscales the recolored grid.
4. `O = canvas(0, (15, 15))`: Creates a 15x15 canvas filled with '0's.
5.  `return O`: Returns the final padded and transformed grid `O`.

**Version 5 (Leveraging `objects` and `paint`):** 

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3)
  x2 = objects(x1, T, F, F)
  x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  x4 = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(5, obj), x3) 
  O = canvas(0, (15, 15))
  for obj in x4:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `x1 = upscale(I, 3)`: Upscales the input grid.
2.  `x2 = objects(x1, T, F, F)`: Extracts all objects (connected components) from the upscaled grid.
3.  `x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)`: Filters the objects to find those with color '8'.
4.  `x4 = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(5, obj), x3)`: Recolors the filtered objects to have color '5'.
5.  `O = canvas(0, (15, 15))`: Creates a 15x15 canvas filled with '0's.
6.  The loop iterates through `x4` and paints the recolored objects onto the canvas `O`.
7.  `return O`: Returns the final padded and transformed grid `O`. 

These are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL functions. Each version uses a different combination of functions and approaches the problem from a different angle.
