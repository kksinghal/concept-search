## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The input grid is first upscaled by a factor of 3.
* All occurrences of digit '8' are replaced with '5'.
* The resulting grid is then embedded onto a 15x15 canvas of '0's, centering the upscaled grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The input grid is first upscaled by a factor of 3.
* All occurrences of characters other than '(', ')', ' ', 'T', 'r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'b', 'k', 'm', 'o', 's', 't', 'n', 'l', 'i', 'F', 'U', 'e', 's', '.', 'p', 'y', '3', '1', '5', '2', '0', '9', '4', '8', '7' are replaced with '0'.
* The resulting grid is then embedded onto a 15x15 canvas of '0's, centering the upscaled grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The input grid is first upscaled by a factor of 3.
* All occurrences of characters other than '(', ')', ' ', 'T', 'r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'b', 'k', 'm', 'o', 's', 't', 'n', 'l', 'i', 'F', 'U', 'e', 's', '.', 'p', 'y', '3', '1', '5', '2', '0', '9', '4', '8', '7' are replaced with '0'.
* The resulting grid is then embedded onto a 15x15 canvas of '0's, centering the upscaled grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3)
  x2 = replace(x1, 8, 5)
  x3 = shape(x2)
  x4 = subtract((15, 15), x3)
  x5 = divide(x4, 2)
  x6 = shift(asobject(x2), x5)
  O = fill(canvas(0, (15, 15)), 5, backdrop(x6))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale and Replace:** Upscale the input grid `I` by a factor of 3 (`x1`) and replace all occurrences of '8' with '5' (`x2`).
2. **Calculate Offset:** Calculate the shape of the upscaled grid (`x3`) and subtract it from the canvas size (15, 15) to get the offset needed for centering (`x4`). Divide the offset by 2 to find the top-left corner position (`x5`).
3. **Shift and Fill:** Convert the grid to an object (`x6`), shift it by the calculated offset (`x7`), determine the backdrop of the shifted object, and finally fill a 15x15 canvas of '0's with '5's at the backdrop indices (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3)
  x2 = apply(lambda row: tuple(5 if v == 8 else v for v in row), x1)
  x3 = ( (len(x2) - 1) // 2, (len(x2[0]) - 1) // 2 )
  O = fill(canvas(0, (15, 15)), 5, backdrop(shift(asobject(x2), subtract((7, 7), x3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale and Replace:** Similar to version 1, upscale the input grid `I` and replace '8' with '5'. However, here we use `apply` and a lambda function to achieve the replacement.
2. **Calculate Center:**  Calculate the center coordinates of the upscaled grid (`x3`).
3. **Shift and Fill:**  Calculate the offset from the canvas center (7, 7) to the grid center, shift the grid object by this offset, and fill the canvas accordingly.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3)
  x2 = {(5, (i, j)) if v == 8 else (v, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(x1) for j, v in enumerate(r)}
  x3 = ulcorner(x2)
  O = fill(canvas(0, (15, 15)), 5, backdrop(shift(x2, subtract((7, 7), x3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale and Replace:** This version directly constructs the object representation of the upscaled grid while simultaneously replacing '8' with '5' using a set comprehension (`x2`).
2. **Find Upper-Left Corner:**  Get the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the object (`x3`).
3. **Shift and Fill:**  Calculate the offset and fill the canvas similarly to version 2.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3)
  x2 = replace(x1, 8, 5)
  x3 = ((15 - len(x2)) // 2, (15 - len(x2[0])) // 2)
  O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), shift(asobject(x2), x3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale and Replace:**  Same as versions 1 and 2.
2. **Calculate Padding:**  Calculate the padding needed on each side to center the upscaled grid within the 15x15 canvas (`x3`).
3. **Shift and Paint:**  Shift the grid object by the calculated padding and directly paint it onto the canvas (`O`).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3)
  x2 = {(v if v != 8 else 5, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(x1) for j, v in enumerate(r)}
  x3 = ((len(x1) - 1) // 2, (len(x1[0]) - 1) // 2)
  x4 = subtract((7, 7), x3)
  O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), shift(x2, x4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale and Replace:** This version utilizes a set comprehension with a conditional expression to directly create the object representation with the '8' to '5' replacement (`x2`).
2. **Calculate Center and Offset:** Calculate the center of the upscaled grid and the offset from the canvas center.
3. **Shift and Paint:**  Shift the object by the calculated offset and paint it onto the canvas. 


These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, using different combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version is designed to handle the nuances of the input-output pairs while adhering to the provided DSL.
