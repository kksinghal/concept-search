## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a grid and performs the following actions:

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 3, meaning each cell is replaced by a 3x3 block of the same color.
2. **Color Replacement:** All occurrences of the digit '8' in the upscaled grid are replaced with the digit '5'.
3. **Centering:** The modified grid is then centered on a 15x15 canvas filled with '0's. 

Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input 0:**

- The '8' in the input is replaced by a 3x3 block of '5's after upscaling.
- The entire pattern is then centered on the 15x15 canvas.

**Input 1 & 2:**

- Since there are no '8's in these inputs, the upscaling and centering are the only operations performed. This results in the input pattern being displayed in a larger format at the center of the 15x15 canvas.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = upscale(I, 3)
    x2 = replace(x1, 8, 5)
    x3 = shape(x2)
    x4 = subtract((15, 15), x3)
    x5 = divide(x4, 2)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), shift(asobject(x2), x5))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `x1 = upscale(I, 3)`: Upscales the input grid `I` by a factor of 3.
2. `x2 = replace(x1, 8, 5)`: Replaces all occurrences of '8' in `x1` with '5'.
3. `x3 = shape(x2)`: Gets the dimensions (height, width) of the upscaled grid `x2`.
4. `x4 = subtract((15, 15), x3)`: Calculates the difference between the canvas size and the upscaled grid size.
5. `x5 = divide(x4, 2)`: Divides the difference by 2 to find the centering offset.
6. `O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), shift(asobject(x2), x5))`: Creates a 15x15 canvas filled with '0's and paints the upscaled and modified grid `x2` onto it with the calculated offset `x5`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3)
  x2 = apply(lambda row: tuple(5 if v == 8 else v for v in row), x1)
  x3 = ((len(x2) - 1) // 2, (len(x2[0]) - 1) // 2)
  O = fill(canvas(0, (15, 15)), 5, backdrop(shift(asobject(x2), subtract((7, 7), x3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `x1 = upscale(I, 3)`: Upscales the input grid `I` by a factor of 3.
2. `x2 = apply(lambda row: tuple(5 if v == 8 else v for v in row), x1)`: Iterates through each row of `x1` and replaces '8' with '5' using a lambda function.
3. `x3 = ((len(x2) - 1) // 2, (len(x2[0]) - 1) // 2)`: Calculates the center coordinates of the upscaled grid `x2`.
4. `O = fill(canvas(0, (15, 15)), 5, backdrop(shift(asobject(x2), subtract((7, 7), x3))))`: Creates a 15x15 canvas and fills the backdrop of the shifted and modified grid with '5's, effectively centering it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3)
  x2 = {(5, (i, j)) if v == 8 else (v, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(x1) for j, v in enumerate(r)}
  x3 = ulcorner(x2)
  O = fill(canvas(0, (15, 15)), 5, backdrop(shift(x2, subtract((7, 7), x3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `x1 = upscale(I, 3)`: Upscales the input grid `I` by a factor of 3.
2. `x2 = {(5, (i, j)) if v == 8 else (v, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(x1) for j, v in enumerate(r)}`: Converts the upscaled grid `x1` to an object representation and replaces '8's with '5's.
3. `x3 = ulcorner(x2)`:  Gets the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the object `x2`.
4. `O = fill(canvas(0, (15, 15)), 5, backdrop(shift(x2, subtract((7, 7), x3))))`: Creates a 15x15 canvas and fills the backdrop of the shifted object with '5's, centering it. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3)
  x2 = replace(x1, 8, 5)
  x3 = ((15 - len(x2)) // 2, (15 - len(x2[0])) // 2)
  O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), shift(asobject(x2), x3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `x1 = upscale(I, 3)`: Upscales the input grid `I` by a factor of 3.
2. `x2 = replace(x1, 8, 5)`: Replaces all occurrences of '8' in `x1` with '5'.
3. `x3 = ((15 - len(x2)) // 2, (15 - len(x2[0])) // 2)`: Calculates the offset needed to center the upscaled grid on the 15x15 canvas.
4. `O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), shift(asobject(x2), x3))`: Creates a 15x15 canvas filled with '0's and paints the upscaled and modified grid `x2` onto it with the calculated offset `x3`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 3)
  x2 = {(v if v != 8 else 5, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(x1) for j, v in enumerate(r)}
  x3 = ((len(x1) - 1) // 2, (len(x1[0]) - 1) // 2)
  x4 = subtract((7, 7), x3)
  O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), shift(x2, x4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `x1 = upscale(I, 3)`: Upscales the input grid `I` by a factor of 3.
2. `x2 = {(v if v != 8 else 5, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(x1) for j, v in enumerate(r)}`: Converts the upscaled grid `x1` to an object representation and replaces '8's with '5's using a conditional expression.
3. `x3 = ((len(x1) - 1) // 2, (len(x1[0]) - 1) // 2)`: Calculates the center coordinates of the upscaled grid `x1`.
4. `x4 = subtract((7, 7), x3)`: Determines the offset needed to center the upscaled grid on the 15x15 canvas.
5. `O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), shift(x2, x4))`: Creates a 15x15 canvas filled with '0's and paints the upscaled and modified object `x2` onto it with the calculated offset `x4`.


Each of these program versions utilizes different combinations of DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired output. This ensures diversity in the solutions provided and demonstrates a deeper understanding of the DSL capabilities.
