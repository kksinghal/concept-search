## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

The transformation identifies objects in the input grid (in this case, the groups of '2's and the single '8') and repositions them onto a 15x15 grid filled with '0's. Each object is scaled up by a factor of three. The '8' is positioned in the center, and the groups of '2's maintain their relative positions to the '8' after scaling. 

**Input 1 & 2 -> Output 1 & 2:**

The transformation applies the same logic as above. The inputs contain textual characters forming shapes.  Each character group is treated as an object. The output places these scaled objects on a 15x15 grid filled with '0's, preserving the relative spatial arrangements from the input.  


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_A - object extraction & scaling, and canvas size from other examples):**

```python
def solve_9aec4887(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (FIFTEEN, FIFTEEN)) # Create a 15x15 canvas filled with zeros
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, F):  # Extract all objects
    O = underpaint(O, shift(upscale(subgrid(obj, I), THREE), multiply(THREE, ulcorner(obj)))) # Upscale, reposition, and underpaint
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, (FIFTEEN, FIFTEEN))`**:  A 15x15 grid filled with '0's is created as the output canvas.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, F)`**:  The code iterates over each object identified in the input grid.
3. **`subgrid(obj, I)`**: Extracts the smallest subgrid containing the current object.
4. **`upscale(..., THREE)`**:  Scales up the extracted subgrid by a factor of three.
5. **`multiply(THREE, ulcorner(obj))`**:  Calculates the new position of the scaled object to maintain relative positioning.
6. **`shift(..., ...)`**:  Shifts the scaled object to its calculated position on the canvas.
7. **`underpaint(O, ...)`**:  Paints the shifted object onto the canvas 'O'. 

**Version 2 (Inspired by Program_B - replacing background & scaling, and object handling from Program_A):**

```python
def solve_9aec4887(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (FIFTEEN, FIFTEEN))  # Create a 15x15 canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, F): # Extract all objects
    O = paint(O, shift(upscale(recolor(color(obj), normalize(obj)), THREE), multiply(THREE, ulcorner(obj)))) # Normalize, upscale, reposition, and paint each object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, (FIFTEEN, FIFTEEN))`**:  Creates the 15x15 output canvas.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, F)`**: Iterates through each object in the input.
3. **`normalize(obj)`**:  Normalizes the object (moves its top-left corner to the origin).
4. **`recolor(color(obj), ...)`**:  Recolors the normalized object with its original color.
5. **`upscale(..., THREE)`**: Scales up the object by a factor of three.
6. **`multiply(THREE, ulcorner(obj))`**:  Calculates the new position.
7. **`shift(..., ...)`**:  Shifts the object to the calculated position.
8. **`paint(O, ...)`**:  Paints the shifted object onto the canvas. 


**Version 3 (Similar to Version 1 but uses 'fill' instead of 'underpaint'):**

```python
def solve_9aec4887(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (FIFTEEN, FIFTEEN))  # Create a 15x15 canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, F):  # Extract all objects 
    O = fill(O, color(obj), toindices(shift(upscale(normalize(obj), THREE), multiply(THREE, ulcorner(obj))))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, (FIFTEEN, FIFTEEN))`**:  Create a blank canvas.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, F)`**: Iterate through objects.
3. **`normalize(obj)`**:  Normalize each object.
4. **`upscale(..., THREE)`**: Scale up by three.
5. **`multiply(THREE, ulcorner(obj))`**: Calculate new position.
6. **`shift(..., ...)`**: Shift to the new position.
7. **`toindices(...)`**:  Get indices of the shifted object.
8. **`fill(O, color(obj), ...)`**:  Fill the canvas with the object's color at the calculated indices.


**Version 4 (Focuses on cell-by-cell operations, inspired by Program_B's background replacement and scaling):**

```python
def solve_9aec4887(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (FIFTEEN, FIFTEEN))  # Create a 15x15 canvas
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        O = underpaint(O, shift(upscale(recolor(I[i][j], initset((ZERO, ZERO))), THREE), (THREE * i, THREE * j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, (FIFTEEN, FIFTEEN))`**:  Creates a 15x15 canvas.
2. **Nested loops:** Iterates over each cell in the input grid.
3. **`if I[i][j] != ZERO`**:  Processes only non-zero cells.
4. **`recolor(I[i][j], initset((ZERO, ZERO)))`**: Creates a single-cell object with the current cell's color.
5. **`upscale(..., THREE)`**:  Scales up this single-cell object by a factor of three.
6. **`shift(..., (THREE * i, THREE * j))`**:  Calculates and shifts the object to its new position.
7. **`underpaint(O, ...)`**: Paints the shifted object onto the canvas. 

**Version 5 (Combines object-level and cell-level processing):**

```python
def solve_9aec4887(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (FIFTEEN, FIFTEEN)) # Create a 15x15 canvas filled with zeros
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, F): # Extract all objects
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        O = underpaint(O, shift(upscale(recolor(I[i][j], initset((ZERO, ZERO))), THREE), (THREE * i, THREE * j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, (FIFTEEN, FIFTEEN))`**:  Initializes the output canvas.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, F)`**:  Iterates over objects in the input.
3. **`for i, j in toindices(obj)`**:  Iterates over each cell within the current object.
4. **`if I[i][j] != ZERO`**: Checks for non-zero cells.
5. **`recolor(I[i][j], initset((ZERO, ZERO)))`**: Creates a single-cell object with the current cell's color.
6. **`upscale(..., THREE)`**:  Scales the cell by three.
7. **`shift(..., (THREE * i, THREE * j))`**:  Shifts to the correct position.
8. **`underpaint(O, ...)`**:  Paints onto the canvas.

These five versions use different strategies and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. They showcase diverse approaches to solving the given problem.
