## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. The program identifies the '2' object and the '8' object in the input grid.
2. It creates a 15x15 canvas filled with '0'.
3. The '2' object is upscaled by a factor of 3.
4. The upscaled '2' object is shifted to a new position on the canvas.
5. The '8' object is replaced with the value '5' and upscaled by a factor of 3.
6. The upscaled and recolored '8' object is shifted to a new position on the canvas.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. The program seems to be extracting specific characters or patterns from the input grid.
2.  It then rearranges and positions these extracted elements onto a 15x15 canvas filled with '0'.
3. The exact pattern and logic behind the rearrangement are unclear from the given output. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

1. Similar to Input_1, the program seems to extract and rearrange elements from the input grid.
2. Again, the specific pattern and logic for rearrangement are not clear from the given output.

## Program_to_be_generated:

It's impossible to generate a program with 100% certainty to achieve the desired outputs for Inputs 1 and 2 without more information about the intended transformations. The outputs for these inputs seem to involve character recognition and complex rearrangement logic that isn't clear from the provided examples. 

However, focusing on Input_0 and the partially successful Program_A, we can generate different code versions by modifying object detection, scaling, and positioning logic.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  if not isinstance(I[0][0], int):
    return canvas(0, (15, 15))
  obj2 = normalize(extract(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2))
  obj8 = normalize(extract(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8))
  return paint(
      paint(
          canvas(0, (15, 15)),
          shift(upscale(obj2, 2), (3, 6))  
      ),
      shift(upscale(recolor(5, obj8), 3), (9, 2))  
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Program_A, this version identifies '2' and '8' objects, upscales them, and paints them onto a 15x15 canvas. 
* The difference lies in the scaling factor and positioning of the upscaled objects. 
* The '2' object is upscaled by a factor of 2 instead of 3 and shifted to a different position.
* The '5' object (originally '8') retains its scaling from Program_A but is shifted to a different position.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  if not isinstance(I[0][0], int):
    return canvas(0, (15, 15))
  obj2 = normalize(extract(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2))
  obj8 = normalize(extract(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8))
  return paint(
      paint(
          canvas(0, shape(upscale(I, 3))),  
          shift(upscale(obj2, 3), multiply((3, 2), shape(obj2))) 
      ),
      shift(upscale(recolor(5, obj8), 2), multiply((4, 1), shape(obj8)))  
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* This version dynamically determines the canvas size based on the upscaled input grid size.
*  It uses the shape of the original objects to calculate offsets for positioning the upscaled objects.
*  The '2' object is upscaled by a factor of 3 and its position is calculated based on its original shape. 
*  The '8' object is replaced with '5', upscaled by a factor of 2, and its position is determined based on its original shape.

**Note:** Generating 3 more distinct versions with the given information and constraints is extremely difficult. The provided DSL lacks functions for complex pattern recognition and manipulation required for the transformation seen in the other inputs. To achieve a score of 0, you would need to provide more examples or specific rules governing the transformation for Inputs 1 and 2.
