## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects (clusters of the same digit) in the input grid and enclosing them within a border of '3's.

**Input_0:**
- The object formed by '2's is identified.
- A border of '3's is drawn around this object, maintaining a one-cell gap from the object itself.

**Input_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, the object formed by '2's is identified.
- A border of '3's encloses this object, again keeping a one-cell gap.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions, each with a different approach:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (1, 1))
    border = difference(backdrop(shifted_obj), backdrop(obj))
    O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** `toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)` identifies the object formed by the digit '2'.
2. **Create a shifted object:** `shifted_obj` is created by shifting the original object one unit down and one unit right.
3. **Find the border:** `difference(backdrop(shifted_obj), backdrop(obj))` calculates the difference between the bounding boxes of the original and shifted objects, giving us the desired border.
4. **Fill and paint:** `fill(I, 3, border)` fills the border with '3's. Finally, `paint` paints the original object back onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
    border_indices = mapply(lambda d: backdrop(shift(obj, d)), [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)])
    O = paint(fill(I, 3, border_indices), obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Generate border indices:** `mapply` applies `backdrop` to the object shifted in each cardinal direction, generating indices for all four sides of the border.
3. **Fill and paint:** Similar to Version 1, the border is filled with '3's and the object is painted back.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
    border = difference(mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc), toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
    O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find border using neighbors:** `dneighbors` is used to find all the direct neighbors of each cell in the object. The difference between these neighbors and the object itself gives us the border cells.
3. **Fill and paint:** Same as Version 1.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  surroundings = difference(product(interval(uppermost(obj)-1, lowermost(obj)+2, 1), interval(leftmost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+2, 1)), toindices(obj))
  border = difference(surroundings, backdrop(obj))
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate surrounding indices:** This version calculates the indices surrounding the object using `product` and `interval`.
3. **Isolate the border:** The actual border is extracted by removing indices belonging to both the surrounding area and the object's bounding box.
4. **Fill and paint:** Same as Version 1.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  padded_obj = toobject(backdrop(obj), fill(I, 2, delta(obj)))
  border = difference(toindices(padded_obj), toindices(obj))
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create a padded object:** `padded_obj` is created by temporarily filling the delta (area within the bounding box but outside the object) with '2's.
3. **Extract the border:** The border is found by taking the difference between the indices of the padded object and the original object.
4. **Fill and paint:** Same as Version 1.

These are five distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation. By analyzing the provided examples and DSL, various other solutions might be possible. Each version utilizes different DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided programming language.
