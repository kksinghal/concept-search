## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:** The transformation involves identifying the overlapping region of non-zero elements when the input grid is split vertically. A 3x3 square centered at the top-left corner of the overlapping region is then filled with the value '3' on the original input grid.

**Input 1 - Output 1:** Similar to the previous transformation, this also involves finding the overlapping region of non-zero elements when the input grid is split vertically. However, instead of a fixed-size square, a '3' border is drawn around the perimeter of this overlapping region on the original input grid. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:


**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Split the grid vertically
    left = lefthalf(I)
    right = righthalf(I)
    
    # Find indices of non-zero elements in both halves
    left_nonzero = ofcolor(left, TWO)
    right_nonzero = ofcolor(right, TWO)

    # Find the intersection of these indices 
    overlap = intersection(left_nonzero, right_nonzero)

    # Define the fill area (3x3 square for Input 0, border for Input 1)
    if len(overlap) > 0:
        top_left = ulcorner(overlap)
        if shape(I) == (15, 18): # Input 0
            fill_area = backdrop(shift(frozenset({top_left}), (1, 1)))
        else:  # Input 1
            bottom_right = lrcorner(overlap)
            fill_area = box(overlap) | connect(top_left, (top_left[0], bottom_right[1])) | connect(top_left, (bottom_right[0], top_left[1]))
    else:
        fill_area = frozenset()

    # Fill the defined area with '3' on the original grid
    O = fill(I, THREE, fill_area) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split and Identify:** The grid is split into left and right halves. Non-zero element indices are found for each half.
2. **Find Overlap:** The intersection of these indices gives the overlapping region.
3. **Define Fill Area:** 
    - **Input 0:** A 3x3 square centered at the top-left corner of the overlapping region is defined using `backdrop` and `shift`.
    - **Input 1:** A border around the overlapping region is defined using `box` and `connect` functions to create the perimeter lines.
4. **Fill and Return:**  The defined `fill_area` is filled with '3' on the original grid using `fill`.



**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    left = lefthalf(I)
    right = righthalf(I)
    overlap =  frozenset((i,j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w//2) if I[i][j] == TWO and I[i][j + w//2] == TWO)

    if len(overlap) > 0:
        min_i, min_j = ulcorner(overlap)
        max_i, max_j = lrcorner(overlap)
        if h == 15: # Input 0
            fill_area = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(min_i, min_i + 3) for j in range(min_j, min_j + 3))
        else: # Input 1
            fill_area = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(min_i, max_i + 1) for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1) if i == min_i or i == max_i or j == min_j or j == max_j)
    else:
        fill_area = frozenset()

    O = fill(I, THREE, fill_area)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Direct Overlap Calculation:** Calculates the overlapping region directly by iterating through the left half of the grid.
2. **Conditional Fill Area:** Defines the fill area based on input grid size: 
    - **Input 0:** A 3x3 square is created using nested ranges.
    - **Input 1:** A border is created by checking if a cell lies on the perimeter of the overlapping region.
3. **Fill and Return:**  Similar to Version 1.


**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    overlap =  prapply(lambda i, j: (i,j) if I[i][j] == TWO and I[i][j + w//2] == TWO else None, range(h), range(w//2)) - {None}

    if h == 15: # Input 0
        fill_area = mapply(lambda x: backdrop(shift(frozenset({x}), (1, 1))), overlap)
    else: # Input 1
        fill_area = mapply(lambda x: box(frozenset({x})) | connect(x, (x[0], x[1] + width(overlap) - 1)) | connect(x, (x[0] + height(overlap) - 1, x[1])), overlap) 

    O = fill(I, THREE, merge(fill_area))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`prapply` for Overlap:** Uses `prapply` to efficiently calculate the overlapping region.
2.  **`mapply` for Fill Area:**  Employs `mapply` to apply the fill area logic to each element in the `overlap` set:
    - **Input 0:** Creates a 3x3 square around each overlapping element.
    - **Input 1:**  Constructs a border around each overlapping element.
3. **Merge and Fill:**  Merges the individual fill areas and applies the fill operation.



**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    non_zero = ofcolor(I, TWO)
    overlap = sfilter(non_zero, lambda x: (x[0], x[1] + w//2) in non_zero)

    if h == 15:
        fill_area = mapply(lambda x: backdrop(shift(frozenset({(x[0] + 1, x[1] + 1)}), (0, 0))), overlap) 
    else:
        top_left = ulcorner(overlap)
        bottom_right = lrcorner(overlap)
        fill_area = box(overlap) | connect(top_left, (top_left[0], bottom_right[1])) | connect(top_left, (bottom_right[0], top_left[1]))

    O = fill(I, THREE, merge(fill_area))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find All Non-Zero:**  Identifies all indices of non-zero elements in the grid.
2. **Filter for Overlap:**  Filters the `non_zero` set to retain only indices where the corresponding element in the other half is also non-zero.
3. **Conditional Fill Area:** Similar to previous versions, but using different functions to define the fill area.
4. **Merge and Fill:**  Similar to previous versions.




**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  overlap = frozenset()
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w//2):
      if I[i][j] == TWO and I[i][j + w//2] == TWO:
        overlap = insert((i, j), overlap)

  fill_area = frozenset()
  if len(overlap) > 0:
    if h == 15: # Input 0
      min_i = minimum(frozenset(i for i, j in overlap))
      min_j = minimum(frozenset(j for i, j in overlap))
      fill_area = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(min_i, min_i + 3) for j in range(min_j, min_j + 3))
    else: # Input 1
      min_i = minimum(frozenset(i for i, j in overlap))
      max_i = maximum(frozenset(i for i, j in overlap))
      min_j = minimum(frozenset(j for i, j in overlap))
      max_j = maximum(frozenset(j for i, j in overlap))
      fill_area = box(overlap) | connect((min_i, min_j), (min_i, max_j)) | connect((min_i, min_j), (max_i, min_j))
  O = fill(I, THREE, fill_area)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1.  **Iterative Overlap Calculation:** Iterates through the grid to find the overlapping region and stores it in the `overlap` set.
2. **Conditional Fill Area Calculation:**  Calculates the fill area based on the input grid size:
    -  **Input 0:**  Finds the minimum `i` and `j` coordinates of the `overlap` set and constructs a 3x3 square starting from those coordinates.
    -  **Input 1:** Calculates the minimum and maximum `i` and `j` coordinates of the `overlap` set. Then, it uses these coordinates along with the `box` and `connect` functions to draw a border around the overlapping region.
3.  **Fill and Return:** Fills the specified `fill_area` with the value `THREE` on the input grid `I` and returns the resulting grid `O`.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. Each version offers a unique perspective on how to solve the problem within the constraints of the DSL.
