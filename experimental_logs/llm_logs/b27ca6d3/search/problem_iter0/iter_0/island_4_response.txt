## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit) on the grid and then extending them horizontally to create a rectangular "box" around the object. The box is filled with the digit '3'.  

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 2 0 
0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0
```

Output:

```
0 0 3 3 
0 0 3 3
0 0 3 3
```

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify all objects in the grid
  boxes = mapply(backdrop, objs)  # Create bounding boxes around each object
  filled_boxes = fill(I, THREE, boxes) # Fill the bounding boxes with '3'
  return filled_boxes
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`**:  Identifies all connected objects in the grid 'I'.
2.  **`boxes = mapply(backdrop, objs)`**:  Applies the `backdrop` function to each object, which creates a set of indices representing the rectangular bounding box around the object.
3. **`filled_boxes = fill(I, THREE, boxes)`**:  Fills the bounding boxes (represented by the 'boxes' indices) on the original grid 'I' with the digit '3'. 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I) # Partition the grid into objects
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, backdrop(obj)), objs)  # Expand each object into its bounding box and fill with '3'
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))  # Combine all expanded objects and paint onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = partition(I)`**:  Partitions the grid into separate objects based on connected digits.
2. **`expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, backdrop(obj)), objs)`**:  For each object, this line first finds the indices of its bounding box (`backdrop(obj)`) and then recolors those indices to the value '3' (`recolor(THREE, ...)`.
3.  **`O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))`**:  Combines all the expanded objects (which are now sets of (value, index) tuples) and then paints them onto the original grid 'I'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  colored_grid = replace(I, mostcolor(I), THREE) # Replace background with '3'
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify objects, excluding the background
  O = paint(colored_grid, merge(objs)) # Paint the original objects onto the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`colored_grid = replace(I, mostcolor(I), THREE)`**: Replaces the most common color (assumed to be the background) in the grid 'I' with the digit '3'.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Identifies all objects in the original grid 'I', excluding the background.
3. **`O = paint(colored_grid, merge(objs))`**: Combines all the identified objects and paints them onto the 'colored_grid' which now has the background filled with '3'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify all objects
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 0)), objs)  # Shift objects down by one row
  extended_objs = mapply(lambda obj: combine(obj, shift(obj, (-1, 0))), objs)  # Extend objects upwards by one row
  O = paint(paint(I, merge(shifted_objs)), merge(extended_objs)) # Paint shifted and extended objects onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 0)), objs)`**: Shifts all the objects down by one row.
3. **`extended_objs = mapply(lambda obj: combine(obj, shift(obj, (-1, 0))), objs)`**: Extends each object upwards by one row by combining it with a shifted version of itself.
4. **`O = paint(paint(I, merge(shifted_objs)), merge(extended_objs))`**: Paints both the shifted and extended objects onto the original grid. This effectively fills in the row above and below each object, creating a filled rectangle.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    h_extended_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, connect(ulcorner(obj), urcorner(obj))), objs)
    final_objs = mapply(lambda obj: combine(obj, h_extended_objs), objs)
    O = paint(I, merge(final_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`h_extended_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, connect(ulcorner(obj), urcorner(obj))), objs)`**:  This line calculates the horizontal extension for each object. It connects the upper-left corner to the upper-right corner using the `connect` function. Then, it recolors the resulting line to '3' using the `recolor` function. 
3. **`final_objs = mapply(lambda obj: combine(obj, h_extended_objs), objs)`**: This line combines each original object with its corresponding horizontal extension, effectively creating the rectangular filled shape.
4. **`O = paint(I, merge(final_objs))`**: This final line combines all the extended objects and paints them onto the original grid 'I'. 

These are five distinct program variations, each using a different combination of functions from the DSL to achieve the desired transformation. Remember that without the actual input-output examples used for training, these solutions are hypothetical and might not perfectly generalize to unseen data.
