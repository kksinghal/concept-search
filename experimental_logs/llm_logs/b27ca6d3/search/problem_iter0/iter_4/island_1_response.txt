## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and surrounding them with a border of the digit '3'. The border is one cell thick and placed directly adjacent to the object, both horizontally and vertically. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**  Several '2' objects are present. Each object is individually enclosed by a '3' border.  
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, but with differently shaped '2' objects. Each object gets a '3' border.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  borders = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs)
  return paint(fill(I, THREE, borders), objects(I, T, T, T))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`borders = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs)`:** For each object, it calculates the indices surrounding the object using `delta`. `mapply` applies this to all objects and merges the results.
3. **`return paint(fill(I, THREE, borders), objects(I, T, T, T))`:** Fills the `borders` indices with the digit '3' using `fill`. Then, it paints the original objects back onto the grid using `paint` to ensure they are not overwritten by the borders.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  padded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), objs)
  return cellwise(I, fill(canvas(THREE, shape(I)), ZERO, padded_objs), THREE)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`padded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), objs)`:**  Calculates the indices for the bounding box (including the object itself) of each object using `backdrop`.
3. **`return cellwise(I, fill(canvas(THREE, shape(I)), ZERO, padded_objs), THREE)`:** Creates a canvas filled with '3' and then uses `fill` to set the `padded_objs` indices to '0'. Finally, it uses `cellwise` to combine this canvas with the original input grid, keeping '3' only where it overlaps with the original '0' cells.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    I = fill(I, THREE, delta(toindices(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):`**: Iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **`I = fill(I, THREE, delta(toindices(obj)))`**: For each object, it calculates the surrounding indices using `delta` and fills them with '3' using `fill`. The modified grid is assigned back to `I`, ensuring the borders accumulate with each iteration.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  result = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    for i, j in delta(toindices(obj)):
      if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I):
        result = paint(result, {(THREE, (i, j))})
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`result = I`:**  Initializes a `result` grid with the input grid.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):`**: Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **`for i, j in delta(toindices(obj)):`**: Iterates through the indices surrounding the object using `delta`.
4. **`if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I):`**: Checks if the indices are within the grid boundaries.
5. **`result = paint(result, {(THREE, (i, j))})`**:  Paints the cell at the valid index with the digit '3' in the `result` grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  marked = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    marked = paint(marked, recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj))))
  return paint(fill(I, THREE, ofcolor(marked, ONE)), objects(I, T, T, T)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`marked = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):`**: Iterates through each object.
3. **`marked = paint(marked, recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj))))`**: Marks the border indices of each object with '1' on the `marked` canvas using `recolor` and `delta`.
4. **`return paint(fill(I, THREE, ofcolor(marked, ONE)), objects(I, T, T, T))`**: Fills the input grid `I` with '3' at the indices marked with '1' in the `marked` canvas using `ofcolor`. Finally, it paints the original objects back onto the grid.
