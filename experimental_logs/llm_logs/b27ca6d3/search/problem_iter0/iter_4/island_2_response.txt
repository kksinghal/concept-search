## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (color 2 in this case) and drawing a border around them using a different color (color 3). The border should include the cells directly adjacent to the object and the corner cells touching those adjacent cells. 

**Input 0:** 

The input contains several single-cell objects and one two-cell object. The output accurately draws a border around each of these objects.

**Input 1:**

This input features more complex objects with multiple cells. The output again correctly identifies and surrounds each object with the designated border. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I) 
  border_cells = mapply(lambda d: shift(toindices(obj), d), [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)])
  corner_cells = mapply(lambda d: shift(toindices(obj), d), [(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1)])
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, frozenset(merge([border_cells, corner_cells]))), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:**  `toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)` finds the object formed by the color '2' in the input grid 'I'.
2. **Find border cells:** `mapply` applies the `shift` function to the object's indices with four different directions - up, down, left, right - to obtain the border cells. 
3. **Find corner cells:**  Similar to border cells, `mapply` and `shift` are used with diagonal directions to find corner cells.
4. **Combine border and corner cells:** `frozenset(merge([border_cells, corner_cells]))` merges the border and corner cells into a single set.
5. **Fill border and paint object:** `fill` function paints the border cells with color '3'. Then, `paint` function draws the original object on top of the filled border.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
    border_indices =  frozenset({n for loc in obj_indices for n in neighbors(loc)}) - obj_indices
    O = paint(fill(I, 3, border_indices), toobject(obj_indices, I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get object indices:** `ofcolor(I, 2)` identifies indices of cells with color '2'.
2. **Calculate border indices:**  For each cell in the object, it finds all its neighbors using `neighbors` function. It then removes the object indices from the set of neighbors to get the border indices. 
3. **Fill border and paint object:**  Similar to Version 1, it fills the border indices with color '3' and then paints the original object back.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)])
  border = difference(merge(shifted_objs), toindices(obj))
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shift object to get potential border cells:**  The object is shifted in all four directions (up, down, left, right) using `shift` and `mapply`, creating four new sets of cells. 
3. **Extract the border:**  The shifted objects are merged, and the original object's indices are removed. This leaves only the cells that form the border.
4. **Fill border and paint object:** Same as Version 1.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  border = (
      mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] - 1, loc[1])}), toindices(obj)) |
      mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] - 1)}), toindices(obj))
  )
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find horizontal and vertical border cells:**  `mapply` is used twice to generate sets of potential border cells. The first `mapply` finds potential horizontal neighbors and the second finds potential vertical neighbors.
3. **Combine to form the complete border:** The horizontal and vertical border cell sets are combined using the union operation (`|`). 
4. **Fill border and paint object:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  border = difference(mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find all neighboring cells:**  `mapply` and `dneighbors` find all directly adjacent cells to each cell in the object. 
3. **Remove object cells to get the border:**  The indices of the original object are removed from the set of neighboring cells, leaving only the border cells.
4. **Fill border and paint object:** Same as Version 1.
