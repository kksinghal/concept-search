## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by a specific digit (2 in this case) and drawing a border around them using a different digit (3 in this case). 

**Input_0:**

- Identify all occurrences of the digit '2'.
- For each occurrence, find its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).
- If a neighboring cell does not contain '2', fill it with '3'.

**Input_1:**

- Same logic as Input_0, applied to a different configuration of digit '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Get indices of all '2's
  border = mfilter(obj_indices, lambda loc: any(nloc not in obj_indices for nloc in dneighbors(loc)))  # Find border cells
  O = fill(I, 3, border)  # Fill border cells with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that contain the value '2'.
2. **`border = mfilter(obj_indices, lambda loc: any(nloc not in obj_indices for nloc in dneighbors(loc)))`:**  This line finds the border cells. It iterates through each `loc` (index) in `obj_indices` and checks if any of its direct neighbors (`dneighbors`) are not part of `obj_indices`. If any neighbor is not part of the object, it means the current `loc` is a border cell.
3. **`O = fill(I, 3, border)`:** Fills the identified border cells (`border`) in the input grid `I` with the value '3'.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid `O` as the output.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I) # Get the object formed by '2's
    border_indices = difference(mapply(lambda d: toindices(shift(obj, d)), [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]), toindices(obj)) # Calculate border indices
    O = paint(I, recolor(3, border_indices))  # Paint the border with '3'
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)`:**  Extracts the object formed by the digit '2' from the input grid `I`.
2. **`border_indices = difference(mapply(lambda d: toindices(shift(obj, d)), [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]), toindices(obj))`:** Calculates the indices of the border cells. It does this by shifting the object in all four directions, merging the resulting indices, and then finding the difference between this merged set and the original object's indices.
3. **`O = paint(I, recolor(3, border_indices))`:**  Paints the border cells with the digit '3' on the input grid `I`.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid `O` as output.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output grid
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and any(I[i+di][j+dj] != 2 for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})  # Fill the cell with '3' if it's a border
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for i in range(1, len(I)-1):` and `for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):`**: Iterates through each cell of the input grid, excluding the border rows and columns.
3. **`if I[i][j] == 2 and any(I[i+di][j+dj] != 2 for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]):`:** Checks if the current cell contains '2' and has at least one neighbor that is not '2'.
4. **`O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})`:** If the condition is true, it fills the current cell in the output grid `O` with '3'.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid `O` as the output.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)  # Get the object
  shifted_objs = (shift(obj, d) for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)])  # Generate shifted objects
  border = difference(merge(shifted_objs), toindices(obj))  # Calculate border indices
  O = fill(I, 3, border)  # Fill border cells with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)`:**  Extracts the object formed by '2' from the input grid.
2. **`shifted_objs = (shift(obj, d) for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)])`:** Creates a generator expression that yields shifted versions of the object in all four directions.
3. **`border = difference(merge(shifted_objs), toindices(obj))`:** Calculates the border by finding the difference between the merged set of shifted object indices and the original object's indices.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, border)`:** Fills the border indices in the input grid with '3'.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid as the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def is_border(loc):
    return I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 2 and any(I[n[0]][n[1]] != 2 for n in dneighbors(loc) if 0 <= n[0] < len(I) and 0 <= n[1] < len(I[0]))
  border = frozenset(loc for loc in asindices(I) if is_border(loc))
  return fill(I, 3, border)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def is_border(loc):`**: Defines a local function `is_border` to check if a given location represents a border cell. It verifies if the cell at the given location contains '2' and has at least one neighboring cell within the grid boundaries that doesn't contain '2'.
2. **`border = frozenset(loc for loc in asindices(I) if is_border(loc))`**:  Creates a frozenset `border` containing the indices of all border cells by iterating through all indices of the input grid and filtering them using the `is_border` function.
3. **`return fill(I, 3, border)`**: Returns a new grid where all cells corresponding to the identified border indices are filled with the value '3'.


These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to solving the border-drawing problem while adhering to the provided DSL. They offer a glimpse into the diverse ways one can leverage DSL functions for efficient and readable code.
