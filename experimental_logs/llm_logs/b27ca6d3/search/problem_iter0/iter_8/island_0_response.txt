## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves drawing horizontal lines of value '3' across the middle of each object in the grid. The original object's values are preserved where the line intersects.

**Input_0:**
- Each isolated '2' gets a horizontal line of '3's drawn across its center.
- The two vertically connected '2's get a single horizontal line spanning their combined width.

**Input_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, horizontal lines are drawn across the center of all objects, maintaining the original value at the intersection points.

## Code Generation:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(mpapply(lambda o, _: frozenset((3, (uppermost(o) + (lowermost(o) - uppermost(o)) // 2, j)) for j in range(leftmost(o), rightmost(o) + 1)), objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), {None})))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`**: Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid (`I`). Each object is a set of cells with the same value, considering only direct neighbors and excluding the background color.
2. **`mpapply(lambda o, _: ..., objects(...), {None})`**:  Iterates through each identified object (`o`) and applies the lambda function to it. The `_` represents a placeholder for an unused argument. 
3. **`lambda o, _: frozenset((3, (uppermost(o) + (lowermost(o) - uppermost(o)) // 2, j)) for j in range(leftmost(o), rightmost(o) + 1))`**: This lambda function defines the line-drawing logic:
    -  It calculates the middle row index of the object using `(uppermost(o) + (lowermost(o) - uppermost(o)) // 2)`.
    -  It iterates through each column (`j`) from the object's leftmost to rightmost extent.
    - For each column on the middle row, it creates a new cell with value '3' and adds it to a frozenset.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Combines the sets of line cells from all objects into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Draws the combined set of line cells onto the input grid (`I`), effectively creating the horizontal lines across the middle of each object.

**Note:** This code utilizes existing DSL functions effectively and avoids the errors encountered in the provided program examples. The logic is concise and accurately reflects the described transformation.
