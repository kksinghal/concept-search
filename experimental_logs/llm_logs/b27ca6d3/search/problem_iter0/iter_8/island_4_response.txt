## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation adds a border of color `3` around all objects (except the background color `0`) in the input grid. The border extends one cell outwards in all directions.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects, excluding background
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, backdrop(obj)), objs)  # Expand each object to its backdrop and recolor
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))  # Paint the expanded objects onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all objects in the grid `I`. The parameters indicate that objects are univalued (T), not connected diagonally (F), and the background color should be ignored (T).
2. **Expand and Recolor:** `mapply` applies a lambda function to each identified object. The lambda function first expands the object to its backdrop using `backdrop(obj)`, which includes all cells within the object's bounding box. Then, it recolors the expanded area to `THREE` using `recolor(THREE, backdrop(obj))`.
3. **Paint Objects:** `merge(expanded_objs)` combines all the expanded and recolored objects. Finally, `paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))` paints these combined objects onto the original grid `I`, effectively adding the border.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, -1)), objs) # Shift all objects up-left by 1
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, backdrop(obj)), shifted_objs)  # Expand and recolor shifted objects
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 1, but it first shifts all objects up-left by one cell before expanding and recoloring. This ensures that the border completely surrounds the original objects, even at the grid boundaries.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_indices = mapply(lambda obj: delta(obj), objs)  # Get indices surrounding each object
  recolored_indices = recolor(THREE, merge(expanded_indices))  # Recolor the surrounding indices
  O = paint(I, recolored_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `delta` function which directly finds the indices surrounding each object (the "delta" between the object's backdrop and its actual indices). This eliminates the need for shifting and directly provides the border indices for recoloring.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, THREE, delta(obj))  # Fill surrounding indices with '3' for each object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object and directly fills the surrounding indices with the color `THREE` using the `fill` function. This approach modifies the grid iteratively instead of painting a combined object at the end.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded_grid = canvas(THREE, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))  # Create a padded canvas filled with '3'
  centered_grid = crop(padded_grid, (1, 1), shape(I)) # Crop to the original grid size
  O = cellwise(I, centered_grid, I)  # Combine original grid with padded grid, prioritizing original values
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a different approach by first creating a padded canvas filled with the border color `THREE`. It then crops the canvas to match the original grid size and uses the `cellwise` function to combine the original grid with the padded grid. The `cellwise` function prioritizes values from the original grid, ensuring that the objects remain unchanged while adding the border.
