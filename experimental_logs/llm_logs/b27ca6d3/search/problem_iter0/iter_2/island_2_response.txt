## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples focuses on adding a 'border' around the '2' objects in the grid. However, this border is not a simple surrounding box. It's a specific pattern that involves filling certain cells adjacent to the '2' objects with the digit '3'.

* **Horizontal '2' segments:** For every horizontal line of '2's, the transformation adds '3's directly above and below them. 
* **Vertical '2' segments:** For every vertical line of '2's, the transformation adds '3's directly to the left and right of them.
* **Corners:** At the corners where horizontal and vertical '2' segments meet, the transformation fills in the diagonally adjacent cell with a '3'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  h_border = mapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), [(1, 0), (-1, 0)])
  v_border = mapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), [(0, 1), (0, -1)])
  corner_indices = mapply(lambda d: backdrop(shift(obj, d)), [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)])
  O = paint(fill(fill(I, 3, h_border), 3, v_border), 3, corner_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** `obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)` identifies all cells with the value '2' and converts them into an object.
2. **Horizontal Border:** `h_border = mapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), [(1, 0), (-1, 0)])` creates a set of indices by shifting the '2' object one row up and one row down.
3. **Vertical Border:** `v_border = mapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), [(0, 1), (0, -1)])` similarly creates indices by shifting the object one column left and one column right.
4. **Corner Filling:** `corner_indices = mapply(lambda d: backdrop(shift(obj, d)), [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)])` calculates the indices of diagonally adjacent cells by shifting the object diagonally and finding the bounding box.
5. **Painting:**  The code fills the `h_border`, `v_border`, and `corner_indices` with '3' and then paints the original '2' object back onto the grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  border = mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc) | ineighbors(loc), toindices(obj))
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find All Neighboring Cells:** `border = mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc) | ineighbors(loc), toindices(obj))` directly calculates all directly and diagonally neighboring cells of the '2' object.
3. **Painting:** Fills the neighboring cells (`border`) with '3' and paints the original '2' object back.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)])
  border = difference(merge(shifted_objs), toindices(obj))
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shifted Objects:** Creates eight shifted versions of the '2' object, each shifted one step in all eight directions.
3. **Calculate Border:** Finds the difference between the combined indices of all shifted objects and the original object's indices, resulting in the border indices.
4. **Painting:**  Similar to previous versions, fills the border and then paints the '2' object.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  h_border =  mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] - 1, loc[1])}, toindices(obj))
  v_border =  mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] - 1)}, toindices(obj))
  border = h_border | v_border
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Horizontal Border:**  Calculates the horizontal border indices by iterating through the object's indices and adding indices one row above and below.
3. **Vertical Border:**  Similar to the horizontal border, but adds indices one column to the left and right.
4. **Combine Borders:** Combines the horizontal and vertical border indices.
5. **Painting:** Fills the combined border and paints the original object.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  border = mapply(lambda loc: sfilter(neighbors(loc), lambda n: n not in toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Valid Neighbors:** For each cell in the '2' object, identifies all neighboring cells that are not part of the object itself.
3. **Border Formation:**  Combines all valid neighboring cells to form the border.
4. **Painting:** Fills the border and paints the original object.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same visual transformation.  Each version leverages different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
