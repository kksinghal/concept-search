## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples focuses on highlighting a "border" around the object formed by the digit '2'. Let's break down the specific logic for each example:

**Example 0:**

1. **Identify the object:** The object is formed by all occurrences of the digit '2' in the grid.
2. **Highlight cells directly adjacent to the object:** The transformation highlights cells directly above, below, left, and right of any '2'. The corners are also highlighted.
3. **Maintain the original object:** The original '2's remain unchanged.

**Example 1:**

This example follows the same logic as Example 0, applying the border highlighting to a different configuration of the '2' object.

## Code Generation:

Based on the provided DSL and the transformation analysis, here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired output:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I) 
  border_cells = mapply(lambda d: shift(toindices(obj), d), [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)])
  corner_cells = mapply(lambda d: shift(toindices(obj), d), [(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1)])
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border_cells | corner_cells), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)`:**  Identifies the object formed by the digit '2' and represents it as a set of (value, index) tuples.
2. **`border_cells = ...`:** Generates the indices of cells directly bordering the object by shifting the object indices up, down, left, and right.
3. **`corner_cells = ...`:**  Similarly, generates indices for the corner cells.
4. **`O = paint(fill(I, 3, border_cells | corner_cells), obj)`:** Creates the output grid by:
    *  `fill(I, 3, border_cells | corner_cells)`: Filling the border and corner cells with the value '3'.
    *  `paint(..., obj)`:  Painting the original '2' object back onto the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  surrounding_cells = mapply(lambda d: shift(toindices(obj), d), [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0),(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1)])
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, surrounding_cells), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic by directly calculating the indices of all eight surrounding cells (including corners) in one go, making it more concise.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  border_indices = mapply(dneighbors, obj_indices) - obj_indices
  corner_indices = mapply(ineighbors, obj_indices) - obj_indices
  O = paint(fill(fill(I, 3, border_indices), 3, corner_indices), toobject(obj_indices, I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes advantage of the `dneighbors` and `ineighbors` functions to find bordering and corner cells respectively. It then removes the original object indices to highlight only the border.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)])
  border = difference(merge(shifted_objs), toindices(obj))
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `difference` function to efficiently find the border by subtracting the original object from the union of its shifted versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  border = (
      mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] - 1, loc[1])}, toindices(obj)) |
      mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] - 1)}, toindices(obj))
  )
  O = paint(fill(I, 3, border), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version explicitly iterates over each cell of the object and calculates the indices of its horizontal and vertical neighbors to determine the border cells.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each leverages different function combinations and logic, offering diverse solutions to the problem.
