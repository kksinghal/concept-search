## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects within the grid and extending them to the right by one cell with the value 3, but only if that new cell would fall on a background cell (value 0).

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* Each isolated '2' object gets a '3' to its right.
* The two adjacent '2' objects in the bottom left corner get a single '3' extending from their rightmost point.
* All other cells remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Similar to Input_0, objects are extended by a '3' to their right if they border a background '0' cell.
* This pattern holds true for single and adjacent '2' objects.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct programs achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify objects
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: combine(obj, sfilter(recolor(THREE, shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1))), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == ZERO)), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))  # Combine expanded objects and paint onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`expanded_objs = mapply(...)`:**  Applies a lambda function to each object:
   - **`combine(obj, ...)`:** Combines the original object with the result of the next operation.
   - **`sfilter(...)`:**  Filters the shifted indices.
   - **`recolor(THREE, shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)))`:**  Shifts the object's indices one cell to the right and recolors them to '3'.
   - **`lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == ZERO`:** Checks if the new cell is within the grid bounds and has a value of '0'.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))`:**  Combines all expanded objects and paints them onto the original grid `I` to generate the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = fill(I, THREE,  sfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1]+1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (loc[0],loc[1]+1))==ZERO and index(I, loc)!=ZERO))
  O = cellwise(shifted_grid, I, shifted_grid[0][0])
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grid = fill(...)`:** Creates a new grid, `shifted_grid`, by filling the input grid `I` with the value 3.
   -  **`sfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: ...)`:**  Filters the indices of the grid.
   -  **`0 <= loc[1]+1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (loc[0],loc[1]+1))==ZERO and index(I, loc)!=ZERO`:** This lambda function ensures that a cell is filled with '3' only if it's within the grid's bounds, the cell to its right is '0', and the cell itself is not '0'.

2. **`O = cellwise(shifted_grid, I, shifted_grid[0][0])`:**  Performs a cell-by-cell comparison between the `shifted_grid` and the original grid `I`. If the values in both grids are the same, the output grid `O` retains that value. Otherwise, it takes the value from the `shifted_grid`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify objects
  expanded_indices = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == ZERO), objs)  # Shift indices right, keep if within grid and background
  O = paint(I, merge(mapply(lambda indices: recolor(THREE, indices), expanded_indices)))  # Recolor filtered indices to 3 and paint on the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all the connected objects within the input grid `I`.
2.  **`expanded_indices = mapply(...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each identified object.
   - **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters the shifted indices to keep only those that meet specific criteria.
   - **`shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1))`:** Shifts the indices of the object one cell to the right.
   - **`lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == ZERO`:** Ensures that the shifted index is within the grid's bounds and corresponds to a background cell (value 0).
3. **`O = paint(...)`:** Creates the output grid `O` by painting onto the original grid `I`.
   - **`merge(mapply(lambda indices: recolor(THREE, indices), expanded_indices))`:** This part takes the filtered, right-shifted indices, recolors them to 3, merges them, and then paints them onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO and I[i][j + 1] == ZERO:
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterates through the grid:** The code then iterates through each cell of the input grid using nested loops.
3. **Conditional Painting:** For every cell, it checks if the current cell is not a background cell (value 0) and the cell to its right is a background cell. If this condition is met, it paints the cell to the right with the value 3 in the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: combine(obj, sfilter(recolor(THREE, shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1))), lambda v_loc: 0 <= v_loc[1][1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, v_loc[1]) == ZERO)), objs) # Expand each object to the right and fill with 3
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))  # Combine expanded objects and paint onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = partition(I)`:** This line of code first partitions the input grid, `I`, into distinct objects based on their color. Each object represents a connected component of cells with the same color.

2. **`expanded_objs = mapply(...)`:** This line then applies a function to each of these identified objects using the `mapply` function. The applied function is a lambda function defined inline.
   -  **`combine(obj, ...)`:** combines the original object (`obj`) with a new set of cells generated by the subsequent operations. 
   - **`sfilter(...)`:** filters a set of cells to keep only those that satisfy a particular condition.
   - **`recolor(THREE, shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)))`:** first shifts the indices of all cells in the current object one position to the right and then recolors these shifted cells to have the color `THREE`.
   - **`lambda v_loc: 0 <= v_loc[1][1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, v_loc[1]) == ZERO)`:**  ensures that the shifted cell is within the bounds of the grid (`0 <= v_loc[1][1] < len(I[0])`) and that this shifted cell corresponds to a background cell in the original grid (`index(I, v_loc[1]) == ZERO`). 

3. **`O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))`:** Finally, this line combines all the expanded objects (`expanded_objs`) and "paints" them onto a copy of the original input grid (`I`) to produce the final output grid (`O`). 


These five programs showcase distinct approaches to achieving the same grid transformation. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving visual reasoning tasks.
