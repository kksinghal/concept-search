## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying 'border' cells of connected components (objects) formed by the digit '2' in the input grid. A border cell is defined as:

1. **External Border:** A cell belonging to an object ('2') that touches the edge of the grid.
2. **Internal Border:** A cell belonging to an object ('2') that is adjacent (including diagonally) to another object.

Once these border cells are identified, they are recolored to '3' in the output grid, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False) 
  border_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  border_cells = mapply(toindices, border_objs)
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(border_cells)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, True, False)`:**  Identifies all connected components of '2's in the input grid `I`, including diagonal connections.
2. **`border_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))`:** Filters the objects to keep only those touching the grid border.
3. **`border_cells = mapply(toindices, border_objs)`:** Extracts the indices of all cells within the border objects.
4. **`O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(border_cells)))`:**  Paints the identified border cells with '3' on the input grid `I` to generate the output `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)
  border_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      if bordering(initset(cell), I) or any(adjacent(initset(cell), other) for other in remove(obj, objs)):
        border_cells.add(cell)
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, frozenset(border_cells)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, True, False)`:**  Same as in Version 1.
2. **Iterate through objects and cells:** This version iterates through each object and its cells individually.
3. **Border condition:** For every cell, it checks if it's on the grid border (`bordering`) or adjacent to another object (`adjacent`). 
4. **`border_cells.add(cell)`:** If a cell meets the border condition, it's added to `border_cells`.
5. **`O = paint(I, recolor(3, frozenset(border_cells)))`:** Similar to Version 1, it paints the identified border cells with '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded_I = canvas(0, add(shape(I), (2,2)))
  padded_I = paint(padded_I, shift(asobject(I), (1,1)))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
              prapply(lambda i, j: 3 if padded_I[i][j] == 0 and any(padded_I[i+di][j+dj] == 2 for di in [-1,0,1] for dj in [-1,0,1]) else I[i-1][j-1],
                     interval(1, len(I) + 1, 1), interval(1, len(I[0]) + 1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Padding:** Creates a padded version of the input grid (`padded_I`) to simplify border checking.
2. **Shifting:** The original grid is placed in the center of the padded grid.
3. **`prapply`:**  Iterates through each cell of the padded grid (excluding the padding).
4. **Border condition:**  Checks if a cell is background (`0`) and has an adjacent '2'. This identifies border cells without explicitly using the `objects` function.
5. **Painting:**  Paints identified border cells with '3' and copies other cells directly from the input.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == 2 and (i == 0 or j == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == len(I[0]) - 1 or
                                 any(I[i + di][j + dj] != 2 and I[i + di][j + dj] != 0 
                                     for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]))):
                O[i][j] = 3
            else:
                O[i][j] = I[i][j]
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each cell in the input grid (`I`) using nested loops.
3. **Border Condition:**  For each cell containing a '2', it checks:
    - If the cell is on the edge of the grid (external border).
    - If the cell has any adjacent cell that is not '2' and not '0', indicating it's adjacent to another object (internal border).
4. **Painting:** If the border condition is met, it paints the corresponding cell in the output grid (`O`) with '3'. Otherwise, it copies the value from the input grid (`I`).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, True, False):
        if bordering(obj, I):
            O = paint(O, recolor(3, toindices(obj)))
        else:
            for cell in toindices(obj):
                if any(adjacent(initset(cell), other) for other in remove(obj, objects(I, True, True, False))):
                    O = paint(O, recolor(3, initset(cell)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates over each connected component (`obj`) of '2's in the input grid using `objects`.
3. **External Border:**  If an object borders the grid (`bordering`), all its cells are immediately painted with '3' in the output grid (`O`).
4. **Internal Border:**  If an object is not on the border, it iterates over each cell of the object and checks if it's adjacent to any other object using `adjacent`. If so, the cell is painted with '3' in the output grid (`O`).
5. **Return Output:** Finally, the modified output grid (`O`) is returned.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to identifying and recoloring border cells, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
