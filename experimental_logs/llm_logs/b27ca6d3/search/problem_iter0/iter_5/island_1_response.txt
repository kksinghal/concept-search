## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background color 0) and drawing a border around them using the color '3'. 

**Input_0:** 
* There are four distinct objects formed by the digit '2'. 
* The output replaces the background cells directly surrounding these objects with the digit '3', effectively creating a border.

**Input_1:**
* Similar to Input_0, this example features multiple objects formed by the digit '2'.
*  The output, again, introduces a '3' border around each object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by `ajdcbdcccdacebbebjceajcdjaiagdfa`, simplifying the logic)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return underfill(I, THREE, mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objects(I, T, T, T))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), ...)`:** For each object, it calculates the surrounding background cells (`delta`) using the object's indices.
3. **`underfill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Fills the identified background cells (`...`) in the original grid `I` with the value `THREE`, creating the border.

**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by `fbdhcffcfjebefcdahebefidhdfddfeh`, removing the unnecessary painting of objects)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  marked = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    marked = paint(marked, recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj))))
  return fill(I, THREE, ofcolor(marked, ONE))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`marked = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas (`marked`) the same size as the input.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T): ...`:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **`marked = paint(marked, recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj))))`:**  Marks the border cells (`delta`) of the current object on the canvas (`marked`) with the value `ONE`. 
4. **`return fill(I, THREE, ofcolor(marked, ONE))`:** Fills all cells on the input grid `I` corresponding to the marked cells (`ONE`) on the canvas with `THREE`, effectively drawing the border.

**Program Version 3:** (Direct approach without an intermediate canvas)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    I = underfill(I, THREE, delta(toindices(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T): ...`:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **`I = underfill(I, THREE, delta(toindices(obj)))`:**  Directly modifies the input grid `I` by filling the surrounding background cells (`delta`) of the current object with `THREE`.
3. **`return I`:** Returns the modified input grid with borders.

**Program Version 4:** (Using `cellwise` for a more functional approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_grid = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ONE, mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objects(I, T, T, T)))
  return cellwise(I, border_grid, THREE)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_grid = ...`:** Creates a grid (`border_grid`) where border cells are marked with `ONE` and all other cells are `ZERO`.
2. **`cellwise(I, border_grid, THREE)`:**  Compares the input grid `I` with the `border_grid`. If a cell in the `border_grid` is `ONE` (border), the corresponding cell in the output is set to `THREE`; otherwise, the original value from `I` is retained.

**Program Version 5:** (Leveraging set operations for border calculation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  all_borders = set()
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    all_borders.update(delta(toindices(obj)))
  return fill(I, THREE, frozenset(all_borders)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`all_borders = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store border cell indices.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T): ...`:**  Iterates through objects and adds their border cell indices (`delta`) to the `all_borders` set.
3. **`return fill(I, THREE, frozenset(all_borders))`:**  Fills all cells in the input grid `I` whose indices are present in the  `all_borders` set with the value `THREE`.
