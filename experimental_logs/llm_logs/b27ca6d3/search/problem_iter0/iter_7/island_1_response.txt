## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves identifying each connected component of the digit '2' (objects). Then, for each object, we find the bounding box and fill it with the digit '3', but only at the positions where the background digit '0' exists. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  This transformation is similar to the previous one. We identify the objects (connected components of '2'), find their bounding boxes, and fill those boxes with the digit '3', again, only where the background digit '0' is present. However, this time, the filled bounding box extends one cell outwards in all directions compared to the bounding box of the object. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify objects (connected components of '2')
  boxes = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), objs) # Get the bounding boxes
  O = underfill(I, THREE, boxes)  # Fill the boxes with '3' only where background is '0'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**:  Identifies all connected components of non-background color in the input grid `I`.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), objs)`**:  For each object, it calculates its bounding box using `backdrop` and `toindices`. 
3. **`underfill(I, THREE, boxes)`**:  Takes the input grid `I`, the digit '3', and the calculated bounding boxes. It fills the bounding boxes with '3' only at positions where the input grid `I` has the background color (default '0').

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T) # Identify objects (connected components of '2')
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(backdrop(toindices(obj)), UNITY), objs) # Shift bounding boxes
  O = underfill(I, THREE, shifted_objs) # Fill shifted boxes with '3' where background is '0'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but introduces a shift to the bounding boxes before filling them.

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Identifies connected components of '2'.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: shift(backdrop(toindices(obj)), UNITY), objs)`**: This line calculates the bounding box of each object, but then it shifts each bounding box one unit down and one unit to the right using `shift(..., UNITY)`. 
3. **`underfill(I, THREE, shifted_objs)`**: Fills the shifted bounding boxes with '3' if the corresponding cell in the input grid is the background color.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify the objects 
  expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda obj: combine(backdrop(toindices(obj)), outbox(toindices(obj))), objs) # Calculate expanded boxes
  O = underfill(I, THREE, expanded_boxes) # Fill expanded boxes with '3' where background is '0'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version calculates a larger bounding box by combining the original bounding box with its 'outbox'.

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Identifies connected components of '2'.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: combine(backdrop(toindices(obj)), outbox(toindices(obj))), objs)`**:  For each object:
    - It gets the original bounding box using `backdrop(toindices(obj))`.
    - It calculates the 'outbox' which includes the cells surrounding the bounding box using `outbox(toindices(obj))`.
    - It combines the original bounding box and the 'outbox' using `combine` to create a larger bounding box.
3. **`underfill(I, THREE, expanded_boxes)`**:  Fills the expanded bounding boxes with '3' only where the input grid `I` has the background color. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify objects
  expanded_backdrops = mapply(lambda obj: combine(backdrop(toindices(obj)), difference(outbox(toindices(obj)), backdrop(toindices(obj)))), objs)  # Calculate expanded backdrop
  O = underfill(I, THREE, expanded_backdrops)  # Fill expanded backdrop with '3' where the background is '0'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 3, but instead of simply combining the bounding box with the outbox, it only adds the cells from the outbox that are not already part of the original bounding box.

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Identifies connected components of '2'.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: combine(backdrop(toindices(obj)), difference(outbox(toindices(obj)), backdrop(toindices(obj)))), objs)`**: For each object:
    - Calculates the original bounding box.
    - Calculates the 'outbox'.
    - Finds the difference between the 'outbox' and the original bounding box using `difference`, keeping only the cells that are in the 'outbox' but not in the original bounding box.
    - Combines the original bounding box with the difference to create an expanded bounding box.
3. **`underfill(I, THREE, expanded_backdrops)`**:  Fills the expanded bounding boxes with '3' where the input grid `I` has the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify the objects
  modified_backdrops = mapply(lambda obj: difference(combine(backdrop(toindices(obj)), outbox(toindices(obj))), toindices(obj)), objs)  # Calculate modified backdrops
  O = underfill(I, THREE, modified_backdrops) # Fill modified backdrops with '3' where background is '0'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version adds the outbox to the bounding box and then removes the original object's cells. 

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Identifies connected components of '2'.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: difference(combine(backdrop(toindices(obj)), outbox(toindices(obj))), toindices(obj)), objs)`**:  For each object:
    - Calculates the original bounding box.
    - Calculates the 'outbox'.
    - Combines the bounding box and the outbox.
    - Removes the original object's cells from the combined set using `difference`. 
3. **`underfill(I, THREE, modified_backdrops)`**: Fills the modified backdrops with '3' where the input grid `I` has the background color.
