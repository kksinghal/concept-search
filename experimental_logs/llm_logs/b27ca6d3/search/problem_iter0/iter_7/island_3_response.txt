## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves identifying the connected component of 2s in the grid and drawing a 3-pixel thick border around it, including diagonally connected cells.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the first transformation, but instead of a uniform border, we're creating a border with the following pattern:
- Top & Bottom: 3-pixel thick line of 3s.
- Left & Right: Alternating pattern of 2s and 3s.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_017c7c7b(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for d in (DOWN, RIGHT, UP, LEFT, UP_RIGHT, UP_LEFT, DOWN_RIGHT, DOWN_LEFT):
      O = fill(O, THREE, shift(toindices(obj), d))
    O = fill(O, THREE, toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We first identify all connected components of non-background colors (2 in this case) using `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)`. 
2. **Iterate and Fill:** For each object, we iterate through all eight directions (including diagonals) and fill the shifted indices with the color 3.  Finally, we fill the original object indices with color 3.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_017c7c7b(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
    border = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: backdrop(obj))
    O = fill(I, THREE, border)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Border:** We find the connected components and then merge their backdrop indices using `mfilter(objs, lambda obj: backdrop(obj))` to obtain the border indices.
2. **Fill Border:** We fill the identified border indices with the color 3.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_017c7c7b(I):
    O = I
    for x in range(len(I)):
      for y in range(len(I[0])):
        if I[x][y] == 2:
          for d in (DOWN, RIGHT, UP, LEFT, UP_RIGHT, UP_LEFT, DOWN_RIGHT, DOWN_LEFT):
            nx, ny = add((x,y), d)
            if 0 <= nx < len(I) and 0 <= ny < len(I[0]):
              O = fill(O, THREE, {(nx, ny)})
          O = fill(O, THREE, {(x, y)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** We iterate through every cell in the grid.
2. **Check for Target Color:** If a cell contains the target color (2), we iterate through all eight neighboring cells (including diagonals).
3. **Fill Neighboring Cells:** For each valid neighboring cell, we fill it with the color 3.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_017c7c7b(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
      O = underfill(O, THREE, shift(backdrop(obj), UP))
      O = underfill(O, THREE, shift(backdrop(obj), DOWN))
      O = underfill(O, THREE, shift(backdrop(obj), LEFT))
      O = underfill(O, THREE, shift(backdrop(obj), RIGHT))
      O = underfill(O, THREE, toindices(obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Backdrop:** Similar to previous versions, we identify connected components and their backdrop indices.
2. **Underfill Shifted Backdrops:**  For each object, we underfill (fill only background cells) the backdrop shifted in four directions (up, down, left, right) and the original object itself with the color 3.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_017c7c7b(I):
    indices_2 = ofcolor(I, 2)
    border = set()
    for i, j in indices_2:
        border |= neighbors((i, j))
    O = fill(I, THREE, border & asindices(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Color Indices:**  We use `ofcolor(I, 2)` to get the indices of all cells with color 2.
2. **Gather Neighboring Indices:**  We iterate through the target indices and gather the indices of their neighbors using `neighbors((i, j))`.
3. **Intersect and Fill:**  We find the intersection of the gathered neighbor indices with the valid grid indices (`asindices(I)`) and fill those cells with color 3.


These are just a few possible implementations. There are many other ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version demonstrates a different approach using various DSL functions in combination, offering diverse and distinct logic for achieving the desired outcome.
