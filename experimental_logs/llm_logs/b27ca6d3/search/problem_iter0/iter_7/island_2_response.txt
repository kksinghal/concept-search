## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected cells of a specific color (in these examples, the color is '2') and then drawing a border around them using a different color (in these examples, the color is '3').  The border is only drawn within the grid boundaries.

**Input_0:** 
- The input has several isolated cells and a pair of connected '2' cells. 
- The output replaces the '0' cells adjacent to '2' cells with '3's, effectively drawing a border around the '2' objects.

**Input_1:** 
- The input has several '2' cells forming more complex shapes. 
- The output similarly draws a '3' border around all connected '2' objects, maintaining the original '2's within the border.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Get indices of all '2's
  shifted_objs = (shift(obj_indices, d) for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)])  # Generate shifted objects in all four directions
  border = difference(merge(frozenset(shifted_objs)), obj_indices)  # Find the difference - those are the border cells
  O = fill(I, 3, border)  # Fill border cells with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)`:**  Identifies and stores the indices of all cells containing the value '2'.
2. **`shifted_objs = (shift(obj_indices, d) for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)])`:**  Creates a generator that yields sets of indices representing the original object shifted one unit in each of the four cardinal directions.
3. **`border = difference(merge(frozenset(shifted_objs)), obj_indices)`:** 
   - `merge(frozenset(shifted_objs))`: Merges the shifted objects into a single set of indices.
   - `difference(..., obj_indices)`:  Subtracts the original object indices from the merged set, leaving only the indices representing the border cells.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, border)`:** Fills the cells at the identified border indices with the value '3' on a copy of the input grid (`I`), producing the output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, False, False) # get connected components of 2's
  border = mfilter(obj, lambda o: bordering(o, I) or any(adjacent(o, other_obj) for other_obj in remove(o, obj)))  # filter for objects on the border or touching other objects
  O = paint(I, merge(recolor(3, border))) # paint the borders with 3's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Identifies connected components of '2's in the grid.
2. **`border = mfilter(...)`:** Filters the connected components to find those that are either on the grid border (`bordering(o, I)`) or adjacent to another connected component (`adjacent(o, other_obj)`).
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(recolor(3, border)))`:** 
    - `recolor(3, border)`: Recolors the identified border components to '3'.
    - `merge(...)`: Merges the recolored components.
    - `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the merged components onto the input grid (`I`), creating the output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Get indices of all '2's
  border = mfilter(obj_indices, lambda loc: any(nloc not in obj_indices for nloc in neighbors(loc)))  # Find border cells using neighbors
  O = fill(I, 3, border)  # Fill border cells with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)`:**  Identifies and stores the indices of all cells containing the value '2'.
2. **`border = mfilter(obj_indices, lambda loc: any(nloc not in obj_indices for nloc in neighbors(loc)))`:**  Iterates through each '2' cell's indices and checks if any neighboring cell (including diagonals) doesn't contain a '2'. If so, the cell is considered a border cell. 
3. **`O = fill(I, 3, border)`:** Fills the identified border cells with '3' on a copy of the input grid (`I`) to create the output grid (`O`).


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Get connected components of '2's
  border_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      for neighbor in dneighbors(cell):
        if neighbor not in toindices(obj) and index(I, neighbor) != None:
          border_cells.add(neighbor)
  O = fill(I, 3, frozenset(border_cells))  # Fill border cells with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, False)`:**  Identifies connected components of '2's in the grid.
2. **Loop through `objs`, `cell`, and `neighbor`:**  Iterates over each connected component, then each cell within the component, and then each direct neighbor of the cell.
3. **Conditional check and `border_cells.add(neighbor)`:** If a neighbor is not part of the current connected component (`neighbor not in toindices(obj)`) and is within the grid boundaries (`index(I, neighbor) != None`), it's added to the `border_cells` set.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, frozenset(border_cells))`:** Fills the cells at the collected `border_cells` indices with the value '3' on a copy of the input grid (`I`), producing the output grid (`O`).


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
    for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        for dj in [-1,1]:
          for di in [-1,1]:
            if I[i+di][j+dj] == 0:
              O = paint(O, {(3, (i+di, j+dj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Outer loops:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid, excluding the border rows and columns.
3. **Inner loops and conditional:** If a cell contains '2', it iterates through its diagonal neighbors. 
4. **`if I[i+di][j+dj] == 0` and `O = paint(...)`:** If a diagonal neighbor is '0', it's replaced with '3' in the output grid `O`.


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same border-drawing transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic constructs.
