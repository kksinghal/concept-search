## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grid can be described as follows:

**For each object in the grid:**

1. **Identify the bounding box:** Determine the uppermost, lowermost, leftmost, and rightmost coordinates of the object.
2. **Expand the bounding box:**  Extend the bounding box by one cell in all directions (up, down, left, right).
3. **Fill with target value:** Fill the expanded bounding box with the target value (in this case, "3"). Overlapping areas retain their original values.

**Example:**

Consider a single-cell object represented by the digit "2" at location (3, 3) in a grid filled with zeros:

```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

The transformation would result in:

```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 3 3
0 0 3 2 3
0 0 3 3 3
0 0 0 0 0
```

This process is then applied to all objects within the grid independently.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, backdrop(shift(obj, (-1, -1)))), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all objects (connected components) in the grid `I`.
2. **Expand and Recolor:** For each object `obj`:
    - `shift(obj, (-1, -1))`: Shifts the object one cell up and one cell left.
    - `backdrop(...)`: Finds the indices of the bounding box of the shifted object.
    - `recolor(THREE, ...)`:  Recolors the bounding box indices to the value `THREE`.
3. **Paint and Merge:** 
    - `merge(expanded_objs)`: Combines all the expanded and recolored objects.
    - `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the combined objects onto the original grid `I`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, 
                                            frozenset((i, j) 
                                                      for i in range(uppermost(obj) - 1, lowermost(obj) + 2) 
                                                      for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2))),
                           objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Expand and Recolor:** For each object `obj`:
    -  Calculates the expanded bounding box indices directly using `uppermost(obj)`, `lowermost(obj)`, `leftmost(obj)`, and `rightmost(obj)`.
    - `recolor(THREE, ...)`: Recolors the calculated indices to `THREE`.
3. **Paint and Merge:** Similar to Version 1.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  expanded_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    expanded_box = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(ul[0] - 1, lr[0] + 2) for j in range(ul[1] - 1, lr[1] + 2))
    expanded_objs.add(recolor(THREE, expanded_box))
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Expand and Recolor:** 
    - Iterates through each object, calculating the upper-left (`ul`) and lower-right (`lr`) corners using `ulcorner(obj)` and `lrcorner(obj)`.
    - Generates the expanded bounding box indices directly using the corner coordinates.
    - Recolors the expanded bounding box and adds it to the `expanded_objs` set.
3. **Paint and Merge:** Similar to previous versions.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    expanded_objs = mapply(
        lambda obj: recolor(
            THREE,
            frozenset(
                (i + di, j + dj)
                for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
                for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)
                for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1]
            )
        ),
        objs
    )
    O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
    return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Expand and Recolor:** For each object `obj`:
   - Iterates through each cell of the object's bounding box.
   - Uses nested loops with `di` and `dj` to consider all neighboring cells, including diagonals, within a 1-cell radius.
   - `recolor(THREE, ...)`: Recolors all these neighboring cells to `THREE`.
3. **Paint and Merge:** Similar to previous versions.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for di in [-1, 0, 1]:
      for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:
        O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, toindices(shift(obj, (di, dj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterative Painting:**
   - Iterates through each object `obj`.
   - For each object, iterates through all neighboring positions (`di`, `dj`) within a 1-cell radius.
   - `shift(obj, (di, dj))`: Shifts the object to each neighboring position.
   - `recolor(THREE, ...)`: Recolors the shifted object to `THREE`.
   - `paint(O, ...)`: Paints the recolored, shifted object directly onto a copy of the input grid (`O`), accumulating the changes over iterations.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified grid `O` after processing all objects.
