## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid (excluding the background color, which is the most frequent color) and extending them by one cell in all directions where the background color is present. 

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- The '2' objects are extended by a layer of '3's.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Both the '2' objects are extended by a layer of '3's. Notice how the extension respects the grid boundaries and doesn't wrap around.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" that implement the described transformation, along with explanations for each:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    return mapply(lambda loc: sfilter(lambda n: 0 <= n[0] < height(I) and 0 <= n[1] < width(I) and I[n[0]][n[1]] == mostcolor(I), dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))
  return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid `I`, considering different colors as separate objects (univalued=False), not connecting diagonally (diagonal=False), and excluding the background color (without_bg=True).
2. **`apply(extend_object, ...)`:** Applies the `extend_object` function to each object found in the previous step.
3. **`extend_object(obj)`:** For each object:
    - **`toindices(obj)`:** Gets the indices of all cells within the object.
    - **`mapply(lambda loc: ..., toindices(obj))`:** For each cell index (`loc`) in the object:
       - **`sfilter(lambda n: ..., dneighbors(loc))`:**  Filters the direct neighbors (`dneighbors`) of the current cell, keeping only those neighbors that are:
          - Within the grid boundaries (`0 <= n[0] < height(I)` and `0 <= n[1] < width(I)`), and
          - Have the background color (`I[n[0]][n[1]] == mostcolor(I)`).
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the sets of neighbor indices found for each object into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, 3, ...)`:** Fills the grid `I` with the value '3' at all the indices obtained in the previous step, effectively extending the objects.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    return prapply(lambda i, j: (i, j) if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I) and I[i][j] == mostcolor(I) else None, range(uppermost(obj)-1, lowermost(obj)+2), range(leftmost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+2))
  return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(lambda obj: sfilter(lambda x: x != None, extend_object(obj)), objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Similar to Version 1, finds all objects excluding the background.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object.
3. **`lambda obj: sfilter(lambda x: x != None, extend_object(obj))`:** This lambda function first calls `extend_object` and then filters out any `None` values from the result. 
4. **`extend_object(obj)`:**  
    - Creates a range of indices covering a bounding box one cell larger than the object in all directions.
    - Uses `prapply` to apply a lambda function to each index pair `(i, j)` within the bounding box.
    - The lambda function checks if the index is within the grid bounds and if the corresponding cell in the grid is the background color. If both conditions are true, it returns the index `(i, j)`, otherwise it returns `None`. 
5. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the valid indices from all objects.
6. **`fill(I, 3, ...)`:** Fills the grid `I` with '3' at the merged indices, extending the objects.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_background(i, j):
    return 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I) and I[i][j] == mostcolor(I)
  def extend_object(obj):
    return mpapply(lambda loc: sfilter(lambda n: is_background(n[0], n[1]), neighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))
  return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**
This version is similar to Version 1 but introduces a separate function `is_background` for readability. The logic for extending the objects remains the same.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def extend_object(obj):
        return sfilter(lambda loc: any(0 <= n[0] < height(I) and 0 <= n[1] < width(I) and I[n[0]][n[1]] == mostcolor(I) for n in dneighbors(loc)), backdrop(obj))
    return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Finds all objects excluding the background.
2. **`apply(extend_object, ...)`:** Applies `extend_object` to each found object.
3. **`extend_object(obj)`:** 
    - **`backdrop(obj)`:** Gets the indices within the bounding box of the object.
    - **`sfilter(lambda loc: ..., backdrop(obj))`:** Filters the indices in the backdrop based on the lambda function.
    - The lambda function checks for each `loc` in the backdrop if *any* of its direct neighbors (`dneighbors(loc)`) are within grid bounds and have the background color. If so, the `loc` is included, effectively finding cells bordering the background.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the results from all objects.
5. **`fill(I, 3, ...)`:** Fills the grid with '3' at the identified border cells, extending the objects.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def valid_neighbor(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I) and I[i][j] == mostcolor(I)
  def extend_object(obj):
    return frozenset((ni, nj) for i, j in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)] if valid_neighbor((ni:=i + di, nj:=j + dj)))
  return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Finds all objects except the background.
2. **`apply(extend_object, ...)`:**  Applies `extend_object` to each object.
3. **`extend_object(obj)`:**
    - Iterates through each cell `(i, j)` in the object.
    - For each cell, it checks its four direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) using a list of offset tuples `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`.
    - For each neighbor, it calls `valid_neighbor` to check if it's within the grid bounds and has the background color.
    - If a neighbor is valid, its index `(ni, nj)` is added to the resulting set.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the valid neighbor indices from all objects.
5. **`fill(I, 3, ...)`:** Fills the grid with '3' at the identified neighbor positions, extending the objects.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, using various combinations of DSL functions and logical constructs. Each version provides a unique solution while adhering to the constraints of the DSL.
