## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the largest object in the grid (excluding the background color 0) and drawing its "outbox" using the color 3. The outbox consists of the cells immediately surrounding the object in all directions.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The largest object consists of all cells with the value 2.
- The program draws a box around this object using the value 3.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The largest object consists of all cells with the value 2.
- The program draws a box around this object using the value 3.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  outbox_indices = outbox(toindices(largest_obj))
  O = fill(I, THREE, outbox_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`, considering objects as contiguous regions of the same color (excluding the background).
2. **`largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)`:**  Identifies the largest object based on the number of cells it occupies.
3. **`outbox_indices = outbox(toindices(largest_obj))`:** Computes the indices of the outbox surrounding the largest object.
4. **`O = fill(I, THREE, outbox_indices)`:**  Creates the output grid `O` by filling the outbox indices in the input grid with the value 3.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: len(toindices(obj)))
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, outbox(toindices(largest_obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid into objects, excluding the background.
2. **`largest_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: len(toindices(obj)))`:** Finds the largest object based on the number of indices it occupies.
3. **`O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, outbox(toindices(largest_obj))))`:** Paints the outbox of the largest object onto the input grid using color 3, creating the output grid.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: len(obj) > 1)
  largest_obj = argmax(filtered_objs, size) if filtered_objs else {(mostcolor(I), (0, 0))}
  O = fill(I, THREE, outbox(toindices(largest_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`filtered_objs = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: len(obj) > 1)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid and filters out any objects with only one cell. 
2. **`largest_obj = argmax(filtered_objs, size) if filtered_objs else {(mostcolor(I), (0, 0))}`:**  Finds the largest object. If no objects are found (meaning the grid is empty or only has the background color), a dummy object is created at position (0, 0) to prevent errors.
3. **`O = fill(I, THREE, outbox(toindices(largest_obj)))`:** Fills the outbox of the largest object on the input grid with color 3, creating the output grid.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  largest_obj_indices = toindices(argmax(objs, size))
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: outbox({loc}), largest_obj_indices) 
  O = fill(I, THREE, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`largest_obj_indices = toindices(argmax(objs, size))`:** Obtains the indices of the largest object in the grid.
3. **`shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: outbox({loc}), largest_obj_indices)`:**  Applies the `outbox` function to each cell index of the largest object and merges the results, effectively computing the outer border indices.
4. **`O = fill(I, THREE, shifted_indices)`:**  Creates the output grid `O` by filling the border indices in the input grid with the value 3.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  is_bg = lambda x: x == mostcommon(I)
  not_bg = lambda x: not is_bg(x)
  filtered_grid = tuple(tuple(THREE if not_bg(v) else v for v in row) for row in I)
  objs = objects(filtered_grid, T, F, T)
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  O = fill(filtered_grid, mostcommon(I), outbox(toindices(largest_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_bg = lambda x: x == mostcommon(I)`:** Defines a lambda function to check if a cell value is the background color.
2. **`not_bg = lambda x: not is_bg(x)`:**  Defines a lambda function to check if a cell value is not the background color.
3. **`filtered_grid = tuple(tuple(THREE if not_bg(v) else v for v in row) for row in I)`:** Creates a new grid where all non-background cells are temporarily replaced with the value 3.
4. **`objs = objects(filtered_grid, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects from the filtered grid (now treating the original non-background cells as a single object).
5. **`largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)`:** Finds the largest object, which represents the original non-background cells.
6. **`O = fill(filtered_grid, mostcommon(I), outbox(toindices(largest_obj)))`:**  Fills the outbox of the identified "largest object" (originally non-background cells) with the original background color on the filtered grid, effectively drawing the outbox around the original objects.
7. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.
