## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of non-background digits) and extending them horizontally to the right edge of the grid with the digit '3', but only if the object has a background digit immediately to its right.

**Input 0:**

- The '2' objects in rows 3, 4, 9, 12, and 15 are extended to the right with '3's. 
- The '2' objects in rows 2 and 11 are also extended, but only from the point where they have a '0' immediately to their right.

**Input 1:**

-  This example highlights the conditional extension. Notice how the '2' objects are only extended starting from where they have a '0' immediately to their right.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and (j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] == mostcolor(I)):
        O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j, w)))
  return paint(O, asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Get grid dimensions (h, w) and create an empty output grid 'O' filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  Iterate through each cell in the input grid 'I'. If a cell is not background and either it's the first cell in the row or the cell to its left is background, fill the output grid 'O' from that cell's column to the right edge with '3'.
3. **Paint Original:**  Finally, paint the original objects from the input grid 'I' onto the modified output grid 'O' to preserve the original object shapes.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j + 1 < w and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, w)))
  return paint(O, asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate Objects:** This time, we iterate over identified objects for potential extension.
3. **Conditional Extension:** For each object cell, check if it's eligible for rightward extension (a background cell to its right). If so, fill the output grid with '3's accordingly.
4. **Preserve Originals:** Paint the original input grid onto the output to retain object shapes.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = I
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w - 1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, w)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:**  This version directly modifies the input grid 'I' to become the output.
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  Iterate through each cell, checking for the condition (non-background followed by background). If found, fill rightward with '3's.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    found = False
    for j in range(w - 1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        found = True
      if found and I[i][j] == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, w)))
        break
  return paint(O, asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Reverse Iteration:** This version iterates through each row from right to left to quickly identify extension starting points.
3. **Flag and Fill:**  A 'found' flag tracks if a non-background cell has been encountered. Extension with '3's occurs until the next non-background cell.
4. **Preserve Originals:** Similar to previous versions.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for obj in objs:
    rightmosts = (max({j for _, (i, j) in obj if i == row}) for row in range(h))
    for i, rightmost_j in enumerate(rightmosts):
      if rightmost_j + 1 < w and I[i][rightmost_j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset((i, j) for j in range(rightmost_j + 1, w)))
  return paint(O, asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 2.
2. **Pre-calculate Rightmosts:** Calculate the rightmost column index for each object in each row to optimize the extension check.
3. **Efficient Extension:** Using the pre-calculated rightmost indices, extend objects with '3's only when needed.
4. **Preserve Originals:**  Similar to previous versions.
