## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The transformation involves identifying each cell with value '2' and replacing its directly adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) with the value '3'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  This transformation is similar to the previous one, but instead of replacing just the directly adjacent cells, it replaces a 3x3 square centered around each cell with value '2' with the value '3'. The original '2' cells are preserved.

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 3, mpapply(lambda x: dneighbors(x), ofcolor(I, 2)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 2)`**: This function identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the value '2'. 
2. **`lambda x: dneighbors(x)`**: This anonymous function takes an index `x` and returns the indices of its directly adjacent neighbors. 
3. **`mpapply(...)`**: This function applies the anonymous function to each index returned by `ofcolor(I, 2)` and merges the results. This creates a set of all indices that should be changed to '3'.
4. **`fill(I, 3, ...)`**: This function takes the input grid `I`, the value '3', and the set of indices, and returns a new grid where all the specified indices are filled with '3'.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(fill(I, 0, ofcolor(I, 2)), 
                 merge(apply(lambda x: recolor(3, backdrop(shift({(3, (0, 0))}, x))), 
                             ofcolor(I, 2))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 2)`**: Identifies the indices of cells with value '2'.
2. **`fill(I, 0, ...)`**:  Creates a copy of the input grid `I` and fills the cells with value '2' with '0'. This is done to ensure the original '2's are not overwritten.
3. **`lambda x: ...`**: An anonymous function applied to each '2' cell index.
4. **`shift({(3, (0, 0))}, x)`**: Creates a single-cell object at the origin with value '3' and shifts it to the current '2' cell location.
5. **`backdrop(...)`**: Gets all indices within the bounding box of the shifted single-cell object (which is essentially a 1x1 square).
6. **`recolor(3, ...)`**:  Recolors all indices in the bounding box to have the value '3'.
7. **`merge(apply(...))`**: Applies the anonymous function to all '2' cell indices, merging the results to get all indices that need to be '3'.
8. **`paint(..., ...)`**: Paints the recolorings onto the grid where '2's were replaced with '0's, effectively achieving the 3x3 square replacement. 

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 3, mapply(lambda x: backdrop(shift({(3, x)}, (-1, -1))), ofcolor(I, 2)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 2)`**:  This function identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the value '2'.
2. **`lambda x: backdrop(shift({(3, x)}, (-1, -1)))`**: This anonymous function takes an index `x` and performs the following:
    - **`{(3, x)}`**: Creates a single-cell object at the given index `x` with the value '3'.
    - **`shift(..., (-1, -1))`**: Shifts the created object one cell up and one cell to the left.
    - **`backdrop(...)`**: Returns the indices of the 3x3 square surrounding (and including) the shifted cell.
3. **`mapply(...)`**: This function applies the anonymous function to each index returned by `ofcolor(I, 2)` and merges the results into a single set. This set contains the indices of all cells that should be changed to '3'.
4. **`fill(I, 3, ...)`**:  This function takes the input grid `I`, the value '3', and the set of indices from the previous step. It returns a new grid where all specified indices have been replaced with '3'.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(apply(lambda x: recolor(3, 
                                              backdrop(
                                                  shift(
                                                      {(3, (1, 1))}, x))),
                                  ofcolor(I, 2))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 2)`**: Finds the indices of all cells with the value '2'.
2. **`lambda x: ...`**: Defines an anonymous function to be applied to each '2' cell index.
3. **`{(3, (1, 1))}`**: Creates a single-cell object with value '3' at location (1, 1).
4. **`shift(..., x)`**: Shifts the created object to the location of the current '2' cell.
5. **`backdrop(...)`**:  Gets the indices of the 3x3 square surrounding (and including) the shifted object.
6. **`recolor(3, ...)`**: Sets the color of all indices in the backdrop to '3'.
7. **`merge(apply(...))`**: Applies the anonymous function to all '2' cell indices, merging the resulting sets of indices into one.
8. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the final recolorings onto the input grid `I`.

### Program Version 5: 

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 3, 
             mpapply(lambda x: 
                     frozenset((x[0] + i, x[1] + j) 
                               for i in range(-1, 2) 
                               for j in range(-1, 2)), 
                     ofcolor(I, 2)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 2)`**: This function finds all the indices of cells in the grid with the value '2'.
2. **`lambda x: ...`**: This defines an anonymous function that takes an index `x` (representing a '2' cell) as input.
3. **`frozenset((x[0] + i, x[1] + j) for i in range(-1, 2) for j in range(-1, 2))`**: This part generates a set of indices representing a 3x3 square centered at the input index `x`. It does this by iterating through offsets `i` and `j` from -1 to 1, adding them to the row and column of `x` respectively.
4. **`mpapply(...)`**: This function applies the anonymous function to each index in the output of `ofcolor(I, 2)` (all the '2' cell indices). The anonymous function generates a 3x3 square of indices for each '2' cell, and `mpapply` merges all these squares into a single set of indices.
5. **`fill(I, 3, ...)`**: Finally, this function takes the input grid `I`, the value '3', and the set of indices generated in the previous steps. It fills all cells at the specified indices in the grid with the value '3' and returns the modified grid.
