## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

The transformation involves identifying the horizontally connected objects formed by the digit '2' and extending them to the right by 3 cells, filling those new cells with the digit '3'. The original '2's remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation involves identifying each individual '2' and constructing a 3x3 square with the '2' at its center. The square is filled with the digit '3'. If parts of the square extend beyond the grid boundaries, they are clipped. 

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_1e0a9b12(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    filled_grid = I
    for obj in objs:
        rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
        for j_offset in range(1, 4):
            filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, 3, shift(obj, (0, j_offset)))
    O = filled_grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  `objects(I, False, False, True)` identifies all connected objects formed by non-zero digits in the input grid `I`. 
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code then iterates through each identified object (`obj`). For each object, it determines its rightmost column index (`rightmost_j`). Then, it shifts the object to the right by `j_offset` (1 to 3) positions and fills the corresponding cells in the `filled_grid` with the digit '3'.
3. **Output:** The modified `filled_grid` becomes the final output `O`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_1e0a9b12(I):
    indices = ofcolor(I, 2) 
    squares = mpapply(lambda x: backdrop(shift({x}, (1,1))), indices)
    O = fill(I, 3, squares)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Target Cell Identification:** `ofcolor(I, 2)` retrieves the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` containing the digit '2'.
2. **Square Construction:** For each index in `indices`, the code constructs a 3x3 square centered around that index. This is achieved using `backdrop(shift({x}, (1,1)))`, which first creates a single-cell patch at the target index, shifts it diagonally by (1,1), and then finds the indices of its bounding box (effectively a 3x3 square).
3. **Filling the Squares:** Finally, the code fills all indices within the identified squares with the digit '3' using `fill(I, 3, squares)` and returns the resulting grid `O`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_1e0a9b12(I):
    twos = asindices(I)
    threes = prapply(lambda i, j: (i + 1, j + 1) if I[i][j] == 2 else None, interval(0, len(I), 1), interval(0, len(I[0]), 1))
    threes = sfilter(threes, lambda x: x is not None)
    O = fill(I, 3, threes)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Potential '3' Positions:**  `prapply` iterates over all cell indices (i, j) in the input grid `I`. For each cell containing a '2', it calculates the index (i+1, j+1), representing the center of a potential 3x3 square.  
2. **Filter Valid Indices:** `sfilter` removes the `None` values from the resulting `threes` set, keeping only the valid indices within the grid boundaries.
3. **Fill with '3':**  `fill(I, 3, threes)` fills the cells at the identified indices in the input grid `I` with the digit '3', generating the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_1e0a9b12(I):
    target_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
    shifted_indices = mpapply(lambda x: {(x[0] + i, x[1] + j) for i in range(-1, 2) for j in range(-1, 2)}, target_indices)
    O = fill(I, 3, shifted_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Target Identification:** `ofcolor(I, 2)` identifies the indices of cells containing the target value '2' in the input grid `I`.
2. **Neighborhood Generation:** `mpapply` iterates over the `target_indices`, generating for each a set of neighbor indices within a 3x3 region centered around the target. 
3. **Grid Filling:** The code utilizes `fill` to replace the values at the specified `shifted_indices` within the input grid `I` with the digit '3', producing the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_1e0a9b12(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  new_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in obj:
      i, j = cell[1]
      for di in range(-1, 2):
        for dj in range(-1, 2):
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, 3, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  O = new_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Detection:** The code first identifies distinct objects within the input grid `I` using `objects(I, False, False, True)`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates through each object (`obj`) and its constituent cells (`cell`). For each cell, it identifies its neighboring cells within a 3x3 radius using nested loops with `di` and `dj`. It then fills these neighbor cells in the `new_grid` with the value '3' using the `fill` function.
3. **Output:**  The modified `new_grid` is returned as the output `O`.
