## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**General Rule:** For each object (group of connected cells with the same value) in the grid, except the object with the most common color (assumed to be the background), draw a border around the object using the value '3'.

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The most common color is '0' (background).
* There are five objects with the value '2'.
* A '3' border is drawn around each '2' object, but not around the background '0'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The most common color is '0' (background).
* There are several objects with the value '2'.
* A '3' border is drawn around each '2' object. The topmost '2' object's border merges with the top border of the grid. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find all objects, excluding the background.
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  
  # 2. Create an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  
  # 3. Iterate through each object.
  for obj in objs:
    # 4. Paint the object's bounding box onto the new grid with value '3'.
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, backdrop(obj)))
    # 5. Paint the original object back onto the new grid.
    O = paint(O, obj) 
  
  # 6. Return the modified grid.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We find all objects in the grid, excluding the background, using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. We create a new empty grid `O` with the background color using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`.
3. We iterate through each object found in step 1.
4. For each object, we draw its bounding box with '3' on the new grid `O` using `paint(O, recolor(THREE, backdrop(obj)))`.
5. We paint the original object back onto the new grid to preserve its shape using `paint(O, obj)`.
6. Finally, we return the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get all unique colors in the grid.
  colors = palette(I) 

  # 2. Create an empty set to store objects.
  objs = initset(None)

  # 3. Iterate over each color.
  for color in colors:
    # 4. If the color is not the background color
    if color != mostcommon(I):
      # 5. Find all indices of the current color and add them as an object to the set.
      objs = insert(ofcolor(I, color), objs) 

  # 6. Create a new grid, initially a copy of the input grid.
  O = I

  # 7. Iterate over each object.
  for obj in objs:
    # 8. Get the bounding box of the current object.
    bbox = backdrop(obj)
    # 9. Fill the bounding box with '3' in the new grid.
    O = fill(O, THREE, bbox)

  # 10. Return the modified grid.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We get all unique colors in the input grid using `palette(I)`.
2. An empty set `objs` is initialized to store objects later.
3. We iterate over each color found in step 1.
4. We check if the current color is not the background color using `color != mostcommon(I)`.
5. If the color is not the background, we find all indices of that color in the grid using `ofcolor(I, color)` and add this set of indices as an object to `objs` using `insert`.
6. A new grid `O` is created as a copy of the input grid `I`.
7. We iterate over each object (set of indices with the same color) in `objs`.
8. For each object, its bounding box is calculated using `backdrop(obj)`.
9. The bounding box is filled with the value '3' in the new grid `O` using `fill(O, THREE, bbox)`.
10. Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify objects in the grid, excluding background.
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  
  # 2. Create a set to store indices that need a border.
  border_indices = initset(None)
  
  # 3. Iterate through each object in the grid.
  for obj in objs:
    # 4. Add the delta (border indices) of the object to the set.
    border_indices = combine(border_indices, delta(obj)) 
  
  # 5. Create a new grid, initially a copy of the input grid.
  O = I
  
  # 6. Fill the border indices in the new grid with '3'.
  O = fill(O, THREE, border_indices) 
  
  # 7. Return the modified grid with borders.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We identify all objects in the grid except the background using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2.  An empty set `border_indices` is created to store the indices where borders will be drawn.
3.  We iterate through each object identified in step 1.
4.  For each object, we calculate its border indices using `delta(obj)` and add them to the `border_indices` set using `combine`.
5.  We create a new grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
6.  We fill the `border_indices` in the new grid with the value '3' using `fill(O, THREE, border_indices)`.
7.  Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)

  # 2. Create a new grid, initially a copy of the input.
  O = I

  # 3. Iterate through each object.
  for obj in objs:
    # 4. Iterate over each cell in the object.
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      # 5. For each neighboring cell (up, down, left, right).
      for (ni, nj) in dneighbors((i, j)):
        # 6. If the neighbor is within the grid bounds and has a different color than the current cell.
        if (0 <= ni < len(O) and 0 <= nj < len(O[0])) and (index(I, (ni, nj)) != v):
          # 7. Fill the current cell with '3' in the new grid.
          O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})

  # 8. Return the modified grid.
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. We identify all objects in the grid, excluding the background, using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. We create a new grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
3. We iterate through each object identified in step 1.
4. For each object, we iterate over its individual cells using `for (v, (i, j)) in obj:`, where `v` represents the color of the cell and `(i, j)` represents its coordinates.
5. For each cell, we examine its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) using `dneighbors((i, j))`.
6. We check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries and if its color is different from the current cell's color using `(0 <= ni < len(O) and 0 <= nj < len(O[0])) and (index(I, (ni, nj)) != v)`.
7. If both conditions are true, it means the current cell is at the border of the object. We then fill the current cell with '3' in the new grid `O` using `O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})`.
8. Finally, we return the modified grid `O`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find all objects in the grid, excluding the background
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)

  # 2. Initialize an empty set to store the border indices.
  border = initset(None)

  # 3. Iterate through each object.
  for obj in objs:
    # 4. Get the indices of the object's bounding box.
    bbox_indices = backdrop(obj)
    # 5. Add the bounding box indices to the border set.
    border = combine(border, bbox_indices)

  # 6. Create a new grid, initially filled with the background color
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))

  # 7. Paint all objects onto the new grid.
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)

  # 8. Fill the border indices with '3' in the new grid.
  O = fill(O, THREE, border)

  # 9. Return the modified grid.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We begin by identifying all the objects present in the input grid (`I`) while disregarding the background. This is accomplished using the `objects` function with the arguments `(I, T, F, T)`, which effectively captures all connected components of non-background colors.

2. An empty set named `border` is initialized. This set will be used to keep track of the indices that constitute the border surrounding the objects.

3. The code then iterates through each object discovered in the previous step.

4. For each object, the `backdrop` function is employed to determine the indices encompassing its bounding box. These indices are then stored in the `bbox_indices` variable.

5. The `combine` function is used to merge the `bbox_indices` with the existing `border` set, effectively accumulating all the border indices.

6. A new grid (`O`) is generated using the `canvas` function. This grid is initialized with the same dimensions as the input grid and is entirely filled with the background color.

7. The code then proceeds to paint all the objects onto the newly created grid (`O`). This ensures that the objects themselves are present on the grid before the borders are drawn.

8. The `fill` function is used to modify the new grid (`O`) by coloring the cells at the indices specified by the `border` set with the value '3'. This effectively draws the borders around the objects.

9. Finally, the modified grid (`O`) with the drawn borders is returned as the output.
