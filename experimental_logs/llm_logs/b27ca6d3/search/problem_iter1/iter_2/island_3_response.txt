## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying groups of connected '2's (horizontally or vertically) and painting a '3' border around them. The '3' border only replaces existing '0's and does not overwrite other '2's.

**Input_0:**

- Two '2' groups are identified: one at the top and one in the middle.
- A '3' border is painted around each group, leaving the original '2's intact.

**Input_1:**

- Several '2' groups of varying sizes are identified.
-  A '3' border is painted around each group, leaving the original '2's intact.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    border = delta(toindices(obj))
    O = underfill(O, 3, border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies connected components of '2's, treating '0' as background.
2. **Iterate through objects:** For each identified object (`obj`):
   - **Find border:** `delta(toindices(obj))` calculates the indices surrounding the object (its border).
   - **Fill border with '3':** `underfill(O, 3, border)` paints the border with '3' but only where the grid originally had '0's.
3. **Return modified grid:** `O`, the modified grid with '3' borders, is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 0 and ((I[i-1][j] == 2 or I[i+1][j] == 2) or (I[i][j-1] == 2 or I[i][j+1] == 2)):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through inner cells:** Loop through each cell in the grid, excluding the border rows and columns.
2. **Check for bordering '2':** For each cell containing a '0', check if any directly adjacent cell (up, down, left, right) contains a '2'.
3. **Fill with '3':** If a bordering '2' is found, fill the current cell with '3'.
4. **Return modified grid:** Return the modified grid `O` with '3' borders.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    O = underfill(O, 3, delta(toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a grid of '0's with the same size as the input grid.
2. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each connected component of '2's in the input grid.
3. **Paint object and border:** For each object:
    - `paint(O, obj)` paints the object onto the canvas.
    - `underfill(O, 3, delta(toindices(obj)))` adds the '3' border around the object on the canvas.
4. **Return modified canvas:**  The canvas `O` now contains the original objects with their '3' borders.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  padded = vconcat((1,1,1), hconcat((1,), hconcat(I, (1,))))
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(padded) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(padded) - 1):
      if padded[i][j] == 0 and ((padded[i-1][j] == 2 or padded[i+1][j] == 2) or (padded[i][j-1] == 2 or padded[i][j+1] == 2)):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i-1, j-1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create padded grid:** `padded` creates a new grid with a border of '1's around the original input grid.
2. **Iterate through inner cells of padded grid:** Loop through each cell in the *padded* grid, excluding its border.
3. **Check for bordering '2':** For each cell containing a '0' in the *padded* grid, check if any directly adjacent cell contains a '2'.
4. **Fill with '3':** If a bordering '2' is found, fill the corresponding cell in the *original* grid (`O`) with '3'.
5. **Return modified grid:** Return the original grid `O` with '3' borders.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        O = underfill(O, 3, {(i-1,j),(i+1,j),(i,j-1),(i,j+1)})
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Identify connected components of '2's and iterate through each object.
2. **Iterate through object cells:** For each cell (i, j) within the object:
    - **Fill surrounding cells with '3':** Use `underfill` to place '3's in the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) only if they contain '0's.
3. **Return modified grid:** Return the grid with the added '3' borders. 


These five versions use distinct strategies and DSL function combinations to achieve the same visual transformation.
