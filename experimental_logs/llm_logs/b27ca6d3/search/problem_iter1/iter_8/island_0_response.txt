## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit, excluding the background) and then drawing a bounding box around them, but only if those objects are not touching the edge of the grid. The bounding box is filled with the digit '3'.

**Input_0:** 

* Objects with value '2' are identified.
* Bounding boxes are calculated for each object.
* Since only the '2' objects at (2,2), (2,7), (4,13), and (11,4), (11,8) are not touching the grid boundary, only their bounding boxes are filled with '3's. 

**Input_1:**

* Same logic as Input_0. 
* Bounding boxes are drawn around the '2' objects at (0,8), (0,9), (4,2), (4,10), (4,14). 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background
  boxes = mapply(box, objs)  # Get bounding boxes for each object
  filtered_boxes = sfilter(boxes, lambda box: not bordering(box, I)) # Filter boxes touching the border
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(filtered_boxes))  # Fill the filtered bounding boxes with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`, treating only directly adjacent cells as connected (not diagonals), and excluding the background.
2. **`boxes = mapply(box, objs)`:**  Applies the `box` function to each object in `objs`, generating a set of bounding box indices for each object.
3. **`filtered_boxes = sfilter(boxes, lambda box: not bordering(box, I))`:** Filters the bounding boxes to keep only those which are not touching the border of the grid.
4. **`O = fill(I, THREE, merge(filtered_boxes))`:**  Fills the input grid `I` with the value `THREE` at the indices specified by the merged set of filtered bounding boxes.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return fill(
        I,
        THREE,
        merge(
            apply(
                lambda obj: box(obj) if not bordering(obj, I) else frozenset(), 
                objects(I, T, F, T)
            )
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`lambda obj: box(obj) if not bordering(obj, I) else frozenset()`:**  This lambda function is applied to each object. It calculates the object's bounding box if it's not touching the grid border; otherwise, it returns an empty set.
3. **`apply(...)`:** Applies the lambda function to each object in the set.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all bounding boxes into a single set of indices.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with `THREE` at the indices of the combined bounding boxes.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if not bordering(obj, I):
      O = fill(O, THREE, box(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:** Iterates through each object in the input grid (excluding background).
3. **`if not bordering(obj, I):`:** Checks if the object is NOT bordering the grid.
4. **`O = fill(O, THREE, box(obj))`:** If the object isn't bordering, its bounding box indices are calculated using `box(obj)`, and these indices are filled with `THREE` in the output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj, grid):
    return fill(grid, THREE, box(obj)) if not bordering(obj, grid) else grid
  
  return last(
             apply(
               lambda obj: rbind(process_object, obj)(I), 
               objects(I, T, F, T)
             )
           ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_object(obj, grid)`:**  A helper function that fills the bounding box of an object with '3' if the object doesn't touch the grid border; otherwise, it returns the grid unchanged.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects from the grid, excluding the background.
3. **`lambda obj: rbind(process_object, obj)(I)`:** Creates a lambda function that binds each object to the `process_object` function (with `I` as the grid).
4. **`apply(...)`:** Applies the lambda function to each object.
5. **`last(...)`:** Returns the last modified grid, which represents the final output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def box_if_not_bordering(obj, grid):
    return box(obj) if not bordering(obj, grid) else frozenset()
  
  return fill(I, THREE, 
              merge(
                papply(box_if_not_bordering, objects(I, T, F, T), repeat(I, size(objects(I, T, F, T))))
              )
             ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`box_if_not_bordering(obj, grid)`:** This function calculates and returns the bounding box of an object only if it's not on the border of the grid.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`repeat(I, size(objects(I, T, F, T)))`:** Creates a list containing the input grid `I` repeated as many times as there are objects.
4. **`papply(box_if_not_bordering, objects(I, T, F, T), ...)`:**  Applies `box_if_not_bordering` pairwise to each object and the input grid `I`, effectively processing each object. 
5. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all resulting bounding boxes into a single set.
6. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with '3' at the indices of the combined bounding boxes.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to solve the transformation task, using different combinations and applications of the DSL functions.
