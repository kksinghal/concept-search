## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected '2's in the grid and drawing a border around them using the value '3'. However, the border is only drawn on the right and bottom sides of the object, creating an 'L' shape.

**Example:**

```
Input:
0 0 2
0 2 2
0 0 2

Output:
0 0 2
0 2 2
0 0 2
  3 3
```


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if (i + 1, j) not in toindices(obj):
        I = fill(I, THREE, {(i + 1, j)})
      if (i, j + 1) not in toindices(obj):
        I = fill(I, THREE, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects formed by connected '2's in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Draw:** The code iterates over each object and each cell within the object. 
3. **Right and Bottom Border:** For each cell, it checks if there's a neighboring cell belonging to the same object on the right and bottom. If not, it fills those positions with '3' to draw the border.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    bottom_edge = {(i+1,j) for (i,j) in toindices(obj) if (i+1,j) not in toindices(obj)}
    right_edge = {(i,j+1) for (i,j) in toindices(obj) if (i,j+1) not in toindices(obj)}
    I = fill(I, THREE, bottom_edge | right_edge)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate Edges:**  For each object, it calculates the set of indices that form the bottom and right edges by finding cells without a neighboring cell belonging to the same object on the respective side.
3. **Draw Edges:** It then uses `fill` to draw '3's at the calculated bottom and right edge indices.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == TWO:
        if i + 1 == len(I) or I[i+1][j] != TWO:
          I = fill(I, THREE, {(i+1, j)})
        if j + 1 == len(I[0]) or I[i][j+1] != TWO:
          I = fill(I, THREE, {(i, j+1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Grid:** This version directly iterates over each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for '2' and Edges:** If a cell contains '2', it checks if it's on the bottom or right edge of the grid or if its bottom and right neighbors are not '2'. 
3. **Fill Border:** If either condition is true, it fills the corresponding neighbor cell with '3' to draw the border.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(tuple(THREE if (j + 1 < w and I[i][j+1] == TWO) or (i + 1 < h and I[i+1][j] == TWO) else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Grid Dimensions:** Gets the height `h` and width `w` of the input grid.
2. **List Comprehension:** Uses nested list comprehension to iterate over each cell in the grid.
3. **Conditional Border:**  For each cell, it checks if its right or bottom neighbor (within the grid bounds) contains a '2'. If true, it replaces the current cell with '3' to form the border. Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  def draw_edge(grid, i, j):
    if j + 1 < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][j+1] == TWO:
      grid = fill(grid, THREE, {(i, j+1)})
    if i + 1 < len(grid) and grid[i+1][j] == TWO:
      grid = fill(grid, THREE, {(i+1, j)})
    return grid
  
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      I = draw_edge(I, i, j)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** Defines a helper function `draw_edge` which takes the grid and cell indices as input. It checks for a '2' in the right and bottom neighbors and fills those positions with '3' if found.
2. **Iterate and Draw:** It then iterates over all cells in the grid and calls `draw_edge` for each cell to draw the right and bottom borders of the objects.
