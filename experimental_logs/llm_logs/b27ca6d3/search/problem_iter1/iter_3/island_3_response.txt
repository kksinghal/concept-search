## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples seems to follow these rules:

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all distinct objects (connected components) in the input grid, treating '2' as the object color and '0' as background. 
2. **Extend Objects:**  Extend the identified objects by adding '3' around their perimeter. The extension only happens in empty ('0') cells.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 2 0
0 2 0 0 
0 0 0 2 
```

Output:

```
0 0 2 0
0 2 3 0
0 3 3 2
```


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") that accomplish the transformation using the DSL:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_B, Iteration):**

```python
def fhbfebabbbdcejgejidbgaabcfgiffcf(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
            O = fill(O, 3, {(ni, nj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  The output grid `O` starts as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:**  The program iterates through each cell of the input grid (excluding the borders).
3. **Check for Object:** If a cell contains the object color '2', it iterates through its four direct neighbors.
4. **Fill Neighbors:**  For each empty ('0') neighbor, it fills it with '3' in the output grid `O`.

**Version 2 (Inspired by Program_A, Object-based):**

```python
def fhbfebabbbdcejgejidbgaabcfgiffcf(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
                    I = fill(I, 3, {(ni, nj)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  The `objects` function is used to identify all distinct objects ('2') in the input grid, treating '0' as background.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Extend Object:** For each cell within an object, it examines its four direct neighbors.
4. **Fill Empty Neighbors:** If a neighbor is empty ('0'), it's filled with '3' in the input grid `I`, effectively extending the object.

**Version 3 (Functional Approach):**

```python
def fhbfebabbbdcejgejidbgaabcfgiffcf(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    return mapply(lambda loc: sfilter(lambda n: 0 <= n[0] < height(I) and 0 <= n[1] < width(I) and I[n[0]][n[1]] == 0, dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))
  return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects` to find all objects ('2') in the grid.
2. **Extend Objects (Functional):**
   - `extend_object` function: Takes an object, finds its indices, gets direct neighbors for each index, and filters for empty neighbors within the grid boundaries.
   - `apply`: Applies `extend_object` to each object.
   - `merge`: Combines the extended neighbors from all objects.
3. **Fill Grid:** Fills the input grid `I` with '3' at the identified empty neighbor positions.

**Version 4 (Using 'delta' function):**

```python
def fhbfebabbbdcejgejidbgaabcfgiffcf(I):
  return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objects(I, False, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Uses `objects` to find objects ('2') in the grid.
2. **Find Perimeter:**
   - `toindices`: Converts each object to its cell indices.
   - `delta`: Finds the perimeter cells (empty neighbors) for each object's indices.
   - `apply`: Applies the above logic to each object.
   - `merge`:  Combines the perimeter cells of all objects.
3. **Fill Grid:** Fills the input grid `I` with '3' at the combined perimeter cell positions. 

**Version 5 (Using 'neighbors' function):** 

```python
def fhbfebabbbdcejgejidbgaabcfgiffcf(I):
    def extend_object(i, j):
        return sfilter(lambda n: 0 <= n[0] < height(I) and 0 <= n[1] < width(I) and I[n[0]][n[1]] == 0, neighbors((i, j)))
    return fill(I, 3,  merge(prapply(extend_object, range(height(I)), range(width(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** Uses `prapply` to iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. **Find Empty Neighbors:** The `extend_object` function checks if a cell's neighbors are within grid boundaries and empty ('0').
3. **Fill Neighbors:** The `merge` function combines all the found empty neighbors, and the `fill` function fills those cells with '3'.


## Conclusion:

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each utilizes different DSL functions and logic, making them distinct solutions to the problem.
