## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects in the grid and drawing a border around them using the value '3'. However, the border is not a simple outline; it extends horizontally to the right edge of the grid. 

**Example:**

Let's say we have a non-background object represented by 'X' in the following input grid:

```
0 0 0 X 0 0
0 X X 0 0 0
0 0 0 X 0 0 
```

The output grid would have a border like this:

```
0 0 0 3 3 3
0 3 3 3 3 3
0 0 0 3 3 3
```

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)

  # 2. Find all non-background objects
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)

  # 3. Initialize an empty grid filled with the background color
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))

  # 4. Iterate through each object
  for obj in objs:
    # 5. Get the uppermost and lowermost row indices of the object
    top = uppermost(obj)
    bottom = lowermost(obj)

    # 6. Iterate through rows from top to bottom of the object
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
      # 7. Find the rightmost column index of the object in the current row
      rightmost_j = max([j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i], default=0)

      # 8. Fill the row from the object's rightmost index to the grid's right edge with '3'
      O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset((i, j) for j in range(rightmost_j, w)))

    # 9. Paint the original object onto the grid 
    O = paint(O, obj)

  # 10. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version iterates through each object and its rows.
2. For each row, it determines the rightmost occupied column.
3. It then fills the grid with '3' from that column to the grid's right edge.
4. Finally, it paints the original object on top of the filled area.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)

  # 2. Create a set to store border indices
  border = initset(None)

  # 3. Iterate through each cell in the grid
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      # 4. If the cell is not background and has a background cell to its right
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and j + 1 < w and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
        # 5. Add indices from current cell to the right edge to the border set
        border = combine(border, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j, w)))

  # 6. Fill border indices in the input grid with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, border)

  # 7. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version directly iterates through the grid cells.
2. It identifies cells belonging to a non-background object that have a background cell to their right.
3. It then marks all cells from the identified cell to the right edge as border cells. 
4. Finally, it fills the identified border cells with '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)

  # 2. Create a new grid, initially a copy of the input grid
  O = I

  # 3. Iterate through each row of the grid
  for i in range(h):
    # 4. Find the rightmost occurrence of a non-background color in the row
    rightmost = max([j for j in range(w) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)], default=-1)

    # 5. If a non-background color exists in the row
    if rightmost != -1:
      # 6. Fill the row from the rightmost occurrence to the right edge with '3'
      O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset((i, j) for j in range(rightmost, w)))

  # 7. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version simplifies the process by iterating through each row.
2. It finds the rightmost non-background color in the row. 
3. If found, it fills the row from that position to the right edge with '3'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)

  # 2. Transpose the grid, effectively swapping rows and columns
  transposed_grid = dmirror(I)

  # 3. Initialize a new transposed grid
  new_transposed_grid = list(list(row) for row in transposed_grid)

  # 4. Iterate through each row (originally column) of the transposed grid
  for j in range(w):
    # 5. Find the first occurrence of a non-background color in the row
    first_non_bg = next((i for i in range(h) if transposed_grid[j][i] != mostcolor(I)), h)

    # 6. Fill the row from the first non-background color to the end with '3'
    for i in range(first_non_bg, h):
      new_transposed_grid[j][i] = THREE

  # 7. Transpose the grid back to its original orientation
  O = dmirror(tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_transposed_grid))

  # 8. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version leverages the `dmirror` function to transpose the grid. 
2. It then iterates through each column (now a row in the transposed grid).
3. It finds the first non-background color and fills the rest of the row with '3'.
4. Finally, it transposes the grid back to its original orientation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)

  # 2. Initialize an empty grid filled with the background color
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))

  # 3. Iterate through each cell of the input grid
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      # 4. If the cell is not a background color
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        # 5. Paint a horizontal line from the current cell to the right edge with '3'
        O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, frozenset(((i, k) for k in range(j, w)))))

  # 6. Paint all non-background objects from the input grid onto the new grid
  O = paint(O, asobject(I))

  # 7. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version focuses on creating the border first and then placing the objects. 
2. It iterates through the grid and paints horizontal lines with '3' from each non-background cell to the right edge. 
3. Finally, it paints the original objects from the input grid onto the new grid, effectively overwriting any '3's that were part of the objects.
