## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' and extending them horizontally to the right, filling the new cells with the digit '3'. This extension stops at the rightmost '2' in each row. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation is similar to the first. It involves extending objects formed by the digit '2' horizontally to the right, filling with the digit '3', but with an added constraint. The extension in each row is bounded by the rightmost occurrence of '2' across all rows below the current row. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # 1. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)

  # 2. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input
  O = I

  # 3. Iterate through each row
  for i in range(h):
    # 4. Find the rightmost '2' in the current row and all rows below
    rightmost = max([j for k in range(i, h) for j in range(w) if I[k][j] == TWO], default=0)

    # 5. If '2' exists in the current row or below
    if rightmost != 0:
      # 6. Extend the object with '3's to the right
      O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset((i, j) for j in range(rightmost, w)))

  # 7. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Obtains grid dimensions and creates an output grid as a copy of the input.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each row of the grid.
3. **Finding the Bound:** For each row, it identifies the rightmost occurrence of '2' in the current and all subsequent rows.
4. **Conditional Extension:** If '2' is present, it extends the object horizontally to the right using '3's, stopping at the identified boundary.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified grid.


**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # 1. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)

  # 2. Create a list to store the rightmost '2' position for each row
  rightmost_list = [0] * h

  # 3. Iterate through the rows in reverse order to find the rightmost '2'
  for i in range(h - 1, -1, -1):
    rightmost = max([j for j in range(w) if I[i][j] == TWO], default=0)
    if i < h - 1:
      rightmost_list[i] = max(rightmost, rightmost_list[i + 1])
    else:
      rightmost_list[i] = rightmost

  # 4. Initialize the output grid
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))

  # 5. Iterate through the grid and fill with '3' based on rightmost '2'
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(rightmost_list[i], w):
      O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset({(i, j)}))

  # 6. Paint the original objects onto the modified grid
  O = paint(O, asobject(I))

  # 7. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Gets grid dimensions and creates a list to store the boundary for each row.
2. **Pre-calculating Boundaries:** Iterates through rows in reverse, finding the rightmost '2' and storing its column index. The boundary for each row considers the maximum of its own rightmost '2' and the boundary of the row below.
3. **Grid Creation and Filling:** Initializes an empty output grid and fills it with '3's based on the pre-calculated boundaries. 
4. **Object Painting:**  Paints the original objects from the input grid onto the modified grid, preserving their original positions.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified grid.


**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  # 1. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)

  # 2. Find the rightmost column containing '2' for the entire grid
  global_rightmost = max([j for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if I[i][j] == TWO], default=0)

  # 3. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input
  O = I

  # 4. Iterate through each row
  for i in range(h):
    # 5. Find the rightmost '2' in the current row
    rightmost = max([j for j in range(w) if I[i][j] == TWO], default=0)

    # 6. Fill with '3's from the rightmost '2' to the global boundary
    O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset((i, j) for j in range(rightmost, global_rightmost)))

  # 7. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Gets grid dimensions.
2. **Global Boundary:** Finds the rightmost column across the entire grid containing a '2'.
3. **Iteration:** Iterates through each row.
4. **Local Extension:** Determines the rightmost '2' in the current row and extends it rightward with '3's, stopping at the pre-calculated global boundary.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified grid.


**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # 1. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)
  
  # 2. Find all objects in the grid 
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  
  # 3. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input
  O = I

  # 4. Iterate through each object
  for obj in objs:
    # 5. Find the lowermost row of the object
    bottom = lowermost(obj)

    # 6. Find the rightmost '2' in the object's row and below
    rightmost = max([j for k in range(bottom, h) for j in range(w) if I[k][j] == TWO], default=0)

    # 7. Extend the object with '3's to the right
    O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset((bottom, j) for j in range(rightmost, w)))

  # 8. Return the modified grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Gets grid dimensions and identifies all objects.
2. **Object-wise Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the grid.
3. **Boundary Determination:** For each object, determines the rightmost '2' in the object's row and all rows below it.
4. **Horizontal Extension:** Extends the object horizontally to the right from its lowermost point using '3's, reaching the calculated boundary.
5. **Output:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  # 1. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)

  # 2. Initialize the output grid
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))

  # 3. Iterate through columns from right to left
  for j in range(w - 1, -1, -1):
    # 4. Check if the column contains '2'
    contains_two = any(I[i][j] == TWO for i in range(h))

    # 5. If the column contains '2'
    if contains_two:
      # 6. Fill the column and all columns to its right with '3'
      O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset((i, k) for i in range(h) for k in range(j, w)))
      
  # 7. Paint the original objects onto the modified grid
  O = paint(O, asobject(I))

  # 8. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Gets grid dimensions.
2. **Reverse Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column of the grid from right to left.
3. **'2' Presence Check:** For each column, checks if it contains the digit '2'.
4. **Rightward Filling:** If a column contains '2', it fills that column and all columns to its right with '3's.
5. **Object Painting:**  Finally, it paints the original objects from the input grid onto the modified grid.
6. **Output:** Returns the modified grid.
