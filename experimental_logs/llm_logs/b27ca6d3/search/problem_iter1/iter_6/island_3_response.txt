## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected non-background cells) and extending them horizontally by one cell to the left and right. This extension only occurs if the extended cell falls within the grid boundaries and is currently the background color.

**Example:**

In Input_0, the two '2's at (2, 7) and (3, 7) are considered a single object. The transformation extends this object to the left and right, resulting in a horizontal line of '3's from (2, 6) to (3, 8) in Output_0.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1 (Inspired by extending objects and filling with background):**

```python
def solve(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    return mapply(lambda loc: sfilter(lambda n: 0 <= n[0] < height(I) and 0 <= n[1] < width(I) and I[n[0]][n[1]] == mostcolor(I), 
                                       {(loc[0], loc[1] - 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}), toindices(obj))
  return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `extend_object(obj)`: For each cell in the object, it checks if the cells to its left and right are within the grid bounds and have the background color. If true, it adds those locations to a set.
2. `apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True))`: This applies the `extend_object` function to all objects identified in the grid (excluding the background).
3. `merge(...)`: It merges the sets of extended locations for all objects.
4. `fill(I, 3, ...)`: Finally, it fills the original grid `I` with the value '3' at all identified locations.

**Version 2 (Inspired by backdrop and filtering adjacent cells):**

```python
def solve(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    return sfilter(lambda loc: any(0 <= n[0] < height(I) and 0 <= n[1] < width(I) and I[n[0]][n[1]] == mostcolor(I) 
                                   for n in {(loc[0], loc[1] - 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}), backdrop(obj))
  return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `extend_object(obj)`: This function iterates through the backdrop of an object (all cells within its bounding box).
2. For each cell in the backdrop, it checks if its left or right neighbor is within the grid and has the background color.
3. If true, the current backdrop cell is included in the result.
4. The rest of the process remains similar to Version 1, applying the extension to all objects and filling the grid.

**Version 3 (Inspired by prapply and filtering valid locations):**

```python
def solve(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    return {loc for loc in prapply(lambda i, j: (i, j) if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I) and I[i][j] == mostcolor(I) else None, 
                                   range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1),
                                   [leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 1]) if loc is not None}
  return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `extend_object(obj)`: This function utilizes `prapply` to iterate over a limited set of coordinates surrounding the object – specifically one column to the left and right of the object's bounding box.
2. For each coordinate, it checks if it's within the grid bounds and has the background color.
3. If true, the coordinate is included in the result.
4. Similar to previous versions, it applies this extension to all objects and fills the grid.

**Version 4 (Combining hconcat, objects and conditional filling):**

```python
def solve(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    left = {(i, j - 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == mostcolor(I)}
    right = {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)}
    return left | right
  return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `extend_object(obj)`: This function directly identifies the left and right neighboring cells of each object cell that fulfill the extension criteria.
2. It checks for grid boundaries and background color.
3. The union of the left and right extensions is returned.
4. The remaining logic is consistent with previous versions – applying the extension to all objects and filling the grid.

**Version 5 (Leveraging shift and intersection for extension):**

```python
def solve(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    extended = toindices(shift(obj, (0, -1))) | toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1)))
    return extended & asindices(I) & ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I)) 
  return fill(I, 3, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `extend_object(obj)`: This version cleverly uses `shift` to create temporary extended objects, shifted one cell to the left and right.
2. `toindices` extracts the indices of these extended objects.
3. An intersection (`&`) operation is performed with the grid indices (`asindices(I)`) and indices of background color cells (`ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I))`) to ensure only valid extensions within the grid and on background cells are kept.
4. The process then proceeds similarly to other versions, applying the extension to all objects and filling the grid accordingly.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation within the constraints of the provided DSL. They highlight the flexibility and versatility of the language in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
