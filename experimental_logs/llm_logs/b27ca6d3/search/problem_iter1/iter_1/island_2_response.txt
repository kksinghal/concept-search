## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and drawing a rectangular border around specific objects using the digit '3'. 

* **Example 0:** A border is drawn around the two horizontally adjacent '2's in the input grid.
* **Example 1:** Borders are drawn around every object in the input grid except for the largest object (formed by the digit '0').

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify objects in the grid, excluding the background (0)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  
  # 2. Find the largest object 
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  
  # 3. Remove the largest object from the list of objects
  objs_to_be_bordered = difference(objs, {largest_obj})
  
  # 4. Draw borders around remaining objects
  for obj in objs_to_be_bordered:
    # Find the bounding box of the object
    bbox = backdrop(obj)
    
    # Fill the bounding box with '3'
    I = fill(I, THREE, bbox)
  
  # Return the modified grid
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We first identify all objects in the grid, excluding the background (digit '0'), using the `objects` function with `univalued=T`, `diagonal=F`, and `without_bg=T`. 
2. **Find the largest:** We find the largest object based on size using `argmax(objs, size)`.
3. **Remove the largest:**  We remove the largest object from the set of objects to border.
4. **Draw borders:**  For each remaining object, we find its bounding box using `backdrop(obj)` and fill it with '3' using `fill(I, THREE, bbox)`.
5. **Return grid:** The function returns the modified grid with borders.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Partition the grid into objects based on color
  objs = partition(I)

  # 2. Find the object with the maximum number of cells
  max_obj = argmax(objs, size)

  # 3. Create a new grid filled with the background color
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) 

  # 4. Iterate over each object
  for obj in objs:
    # 5. If the object is not the largest, paint its bounding box onto the new grid
    if obj != max_obj:
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, backdrop(obj)))
    # 6. Otherwise, paint the object itself onto the new grid 
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj) 

  # 7. Return the new grid 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition grid:**  Divide the grid into separate objects based on the color of cells using `partition(I)`.
2. **Find the largest:**  Identify the largest object by its size using `argmax(objs, size)`.
3. **Create new grid:** Initialize a new output grid (`O`) filled with the background color using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`.
4. **Iterate and paint:** Loop through each object in the `objs` set.
    - If an object is not the largest one, paint its bounding box (using `backdrop`) onto the new grid with the color '3' using `recolor` and `paint`.
    - If the object is the largest, paint the object itself onto the new grid using `paint`.
5. **Return grid:**  Finally, return the newly constructed grid (`O`). 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get all unique colors in the input grid
  colors = palette(I)

  # 2. Create an empty set to store objects that need a border
  objs_to_border = initset(None)

  # 3. Iterate over each color
  for color in colors:
    # 4. Find all indices of the current color in the grid
    indices = ofcolor(I, color)

    # 5. If there are indices for the current color
    if size(indices) > 0:
      # 6. Add the indices to the set of objects needing a border
      objs_to_border = insert(indices, objs_to_border)

  # 7. Find the object with the maximum size (number of indices)
  max_size_obj = argmax(objs_to_border, size)

  # 8. Remove the object with the maximum size from the set
  objs_to_border = remove(max_size_obj, objs_to_border)

  # 9. Create a new grid, initially a copy of the input grid
  O = I

  # 10. Iterate over the remaining objects needing a border
  for obj in objs_to_border:
    # 11. Get the bounding box of the current object
    bbox = backdrop(obj)

    # 12. Fill the bounding box with the value '3' in the new grid
    O = fill(O, THREE, bbox)

  # 13. Return the modified grid with borders
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get unique colors:** Extract all distinct colors (digits) present in the input grid using `palette(I)`.
2. **Initialize object set:** Create an empty set (`objs_to_border`) to store objects that will have a border.
3. **Iterate over colors:** Loop through each unique color in the `colors` set.
4. **Find color indices:** Identify all indices in the grid where the current color is present using `ofcolor(I, color)`.
5. **Add to border set:** If indices for the current color exist, add them to the `objs_to_border` set.
6. **Find largest object:** Determine the object with the maximum size (number of indices) using `argmax(objs_to_border, size)`.
7. **Remove the largest:** Remove the largest object from the set of objects needing a border.
8. **Create new grid:** Initialize a new output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
9. **Iterate and draw borders:**  Loop through the remaining objects in the `objs_to_border` set.
    - Calculate the bounding box of each object using `backdrop(obj)`.
    - Fill the bounding box in the output grid (`O`) with the color '3' using `fill(O, THREE, bbox)`.
10. **Return modified grid:** Finally, return the modified grid (`O`) containing borders around the desired objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify all objects in the input grid (excluding background)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  
  # 2. Sort the objects based on their size (smallest to largest)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, size)
  
  # 3. Get the second smallest object from the sorted list
  second_smallest_obj = sorted_objs[1]
  
  # 4. Find the bounding box for the second smallest object
  bbox = backdrop(second_smallest_obj)
  
  # 5. Fill the bounding box with the value '3' on the input grid
  O = fill(I, THREE, bbox)
  
  # 6. Return the modified grid with the filled bounding box
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Identify all objects in the grid excluding the background using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Sort objects:** Sort the identified objects from smallest to largest based on their size using `order(objs, size)`.
3. **Get second smallest:**  Retrieve the second smallest object from the sorted list.
4. **Bounding box:** Determine the bounding box of the second smallest object using `backdrop(second_smallest_obj)`.
5. **Fill bounding box:**  Fill the bounding box with the digit '3' in the input grid (`I`) using `fill(I, THREE, bbox)`.
6. **Return grid:** Return the modified grid with the filled bounding box as the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify all objects in the grid except the background.
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  
  # 2. Create an empty set to store objects that will have a border.
  objs_to_border = initset(None)
  
  # 3. Iterate through each object in the grid.
  for obj in objs:
    # 4. If the object's width is greater than 1, add it to the set of objects needing a border.
    if width(obj) > 1:
      objs_to_border = insert(obj, objs_to_border)
  
  # 5. Create a new grid, initially a copy of the input grid.
  O = I
  
  # 6. Iterate through the objects needing a border.
  for obj in objs_to_border:
    # 7. Calculate the bounding box of the current object.
    bbox = backdrop(obj)
    # 8. Fill the bounding box with '3' in the new grid.
    O = fill(O, THREE, bbox)
  
  # 9. Return the modified grid with borders.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identify all distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background (digit '0'), using the `objects` function.
2. **Initialize Border Set:**  Create an empty set called `objs_to_border` to store objects that require a border.
3. **Iterate and Filter Objects:**  Iterate through each object identified in step 1.
   - If the object's width (calculated using `width(obj)`) is greater than 1, add it to the `objs_to_border` set. 
4. **Copy Input Grid:**  Create a new grid (`O`), initially a copy of the input grid (`I`). This new grid will be modified to include the borders.
5. **Draw Borders:**  Iterate through each object in the `objs_to_border` set.
   - For each object, calculate its bounding box using the `backdrop(obj)` function.
   - Fill the cells within the bounding box on the new grid (`O`) with the value '3' using the `fill` function.
6. **Return Output Grid:** Return the modified grid (`O`) containing borders around the objects with a width greater than 1.
