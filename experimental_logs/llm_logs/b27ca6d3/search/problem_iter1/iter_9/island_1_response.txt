## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves drawing a horizontal line of value '3' extending one cell to the left and right of every '2' in the input grid. 

**Input_0:**

- Each isolated '2' gets a 3-cell horizontal line centered on it.
- The two adjacent '2's in the last row get a continuous 5-cell horizontal line.

**Input_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, horizontal 3-cell lines are drawn centered on each '2'.
-  Notice how the lines extend to the edges of existing '2's, creating continuous lines where '2's are close together. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Find all indices of '2's
  indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  # Generate horizontal lines around each index
  h_lines = mapply(lambda x: frozenset({(x[0], x[1]-1), x, (x[0], x[1]+1)}), indices)
  # Fill the grid with '3' at these lines
  O = fill(I, 3, h_lines)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, 2)` identifies all indices containing the value '2'.
2. `mapply` applies a lambda function to each index, creating a set of three indices representing a horizontal line centered on the original index.
3. `fill(I, 3, h_lines)` fills the input grid 'I' with the value '3' at all indices within the generated `h_lines`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # Find all objects of color '2'
  twos = objects(I, True, False, True)
  # Extend each object horizontally by one cell on both sides
  extended_twos = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((2, (i, j)) for i, j in backdrop(obj)), twos)
  # Paint the extended objects onto the original grid
  O = paint(I, extended_twos)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts all objects of color '2' from the grid.
2. For each object, `backdrop` finds all indices within its bounding box. 
3. `mapply` applies a lambda function that creates a new object with '2' at every index in the bounding box.
4. `paint` draws these extended objects onto the original grid, effectively creating horizontal extensions.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  # Create a canvas of '3's with the same dimensions as the input
  canvas_3 = canvas(3, shape(I))
  # Find all indices of '2's in the input
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  # Combine the canvas of '3's with the original grid at the '2' indices
  O = cellwise(canvas_3, I, I) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(3, shape(I))` creates a grid filled with '3's having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. `ofcolor(I, 2)` identifies all indices of '2's.
3. `cellwise` compares the canvas of '3's and the input grid. For matching indices (those with '2' in the input), it keeps the canvas value ('3'), and for non-matching indices, it keeps the input grid's value.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # Extract all objects
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  # For each object, create a horizontal line centered on its center of mass
  lines = mapply(lambda obj: connect(centerofmass(obj), add(centerofmass(obj), (0, 1))), objs)
  # Extend each line by one cell to the left and right
  extended_lines = mapply(lambda line: frozenset({(i, j-1) for i, j in line} | line | {(i, j+1) for i, j in line}), lines)
  # Fill the grid with '3' at the extended lines
  O = fill(I, 3, extended_lines)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts all objects.
2. `mapply` applies a lambda function to create a horizontal 2-cell line centered on each object's center of mass.
3. Another `mapply` extends each 2-cell line by one cell to the left and right.
4. `fill` fills the grid with '3' at all indices in the extended lines.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  # Find indices of '2's
  indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  # Generate horizontal neighbor indices for each '2' index
  neighbors_h = mapply(lambda x: {(x[0], x[1] - 1), (x[0], x[1] + 1)}, indices)
  # Combine original indices with their horizontal neighbors
  all_indices = combine(indices, neighbors_h)
  # Fill the grid with '3' at the combined indices
  O = fill(I, 3, all_indices) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, 2)` extracts indices of '2's.
2. `mapply` finds the left and right horizontal neighbor indices for each '2' index.
3. `combine` merges the original '2' indices with their horizontal neighbors.
4. `fill` fills the grid with '3' at all combined indices.
