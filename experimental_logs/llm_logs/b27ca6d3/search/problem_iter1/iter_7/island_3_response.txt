## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying all non-background objects on the grid and extending them horizontally to the left and right by one cell. This extension only occurs if the neighboring cell is part of the background.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '2' digits represent non-background objects. Each '2' is extended to the left and right with a '3' if the adjacent cell was originally a '0' (background).
* **Input_1:**  The same logic applies, resulting in horizontal extensions of '2' objects by a single cell on either side, filling with '3' where the background allows. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    return toobject(combine(combine(toindices(obj), 
                                    shift(toindices(obj), (0, -1))),
                            shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1))),
                    I)
  return fill(paint(I, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True)))),
              3,
              ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_object(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input and returns an extended version of that object.
   - `toindices(obj)`: Extracts the indices of the object.
   - `shift(toindices(obj), (0, -1))`: Shifts the indices one cell to the left.
   - `shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1))`: Shifts the indices one cell to the right.
   - `combine(...)`: Combines the original indices with the left and right shifted indices.
   - `toobject(..., I)`: Converts the combined indices back to an object, using the values from the input grid `I`.
2. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid.
3. **`apply(extend_object, ...)`:** Applies the `extend_object` function to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`: Merges the extended objects into a single object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged object onto a copy of the input grid.
6. **`fill(..., 3, ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I)))`: Fills the cells of the background color in the painted grid with the value '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def extend_object(obj):
        return  frozenset((3, n) for loc in toindices(obj)
                        for n in {(loc[0], loc[1] - 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}
                        if 0 <= n[0] < height(I) and 0 <= n[1] < width(I) and I[n[0]][n[1]] == mostcolor(I))
    return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True))))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_object(obj)`:** Iterates through each cell location (`loc`) in the object.
2. For each `loc`, it checks the left and right neighbors (`n`):
   - If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries and has the background color, it's added as a new cell with value '3' to the `extended` set.
3. The `extend_object` function returns the `extended` set, representing the horizontally extended object.
4. The rest of the code functions similarly to Version 1, painting the extended objects onto the input grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return fill(I, 3,
             merge(apply(lambda obj:
                      sfilter(lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] - 1 and I[loc[0]][loc[1] - 1] == mostcolor(I) or 
                                         loc[1] + 1 < width(I) and I[loc[0]][loc[1] + 1] == mostcolor(I),
                              backdrop(obj)),
                        objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`lambda obj: ... `:** Defines a lambda function that takes an object as input.
2. **`sfilter(lambda loc: ..., backdrop(obj))`:** Filters the backdrop (bounding box) of the object. 
   - For each location (`loc`) in the backdrop, it checks if either the left or right neighbor is within grid boundaries and has the background color.
   - If true, the `loc` is kept; otherwise, it's filtered out. 
3. The remaining code functions like previous versions, filling the filtered backdrop locations with '3'. 

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I,
                 merge(apply(lambda obj: 
                              frozenset((3, (loc[0], loc[1] - 1)) for loc in toindices(obj) if loc[1] > 0 and I[loc[0]][loc[1] - 1] == mostcolor(I)) |
                              frozenset((3, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) for loc in toindices(obj) if loc[1] < width(I) - 1 and I[loc[0]][loc[1] + 1] == mostcolor(I)),
                              objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`lambda obj: ...`:**  A lambda function processes each object. 
2. Two separate `frozenset` comprehensions are used:
   - The first creates new cells with value '3' to the left of object cells if they are within the grid and have the background color.
   - The second does the same for the right side of the object cells.
3. The two `frozensets` are combined using `|`.
4. The rest of the code paints the combined sets onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    extended = set()
    for loc in toindices(obj):
      for d in [-1, 1]:
        new_loc = (loc[0], loc[1] + d)
        if 0 <= new_loc[0] < height(I) and 0 <= new_loc[1] < width(I) and I[new_loc[0]][new_loc[1]] == mostcolor(I):
          extended.add((3, new_loc))
    return frozenset(extended)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_object(obj)`:**  This function iterates through each location `loc` in the object's indices. 
2. For each `loc`, it checks the left (`d=-1`) and right (`d=1`) neighbors.
3. If the neighbor is within grid boundaries and has the background color, a new cell with value '3' is added to the `extended` set.
4. The `extended` set, containing the horizontally extended object, is returned.
5. The remaining code works similarly to previous versions, merging and painting the extended objects onto the input grid. 


These five program versions provide distinct ways to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL.
