## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color) in the input grid and extending them to the right by a fixed number of cells (3 in this case). The extension should only occur if the object's color is not the background color (most frequent color).

**Input 0:** 
- Each '2' object is extended to the right by three '3's.

**Input 1:**
- Similar to Input 0, '2' objects are extended rightward by three '3's. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program A's object iteration and Program B's `ofcolor`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 3, 
              merge(apply(lambda x: 
                          frozenset((x[0], x[1] + k) for k in range(1, 4)), 
                          ofcolor(I, 2)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 2)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells with the value '2' in the input grid `I`.
2. **`lambda x: frozenset((x[0], x[1] + k) for k in range(1, 4))`:**  This anonymous function takes an index `x` and generates a set of indices shifted to the right by 1, 2, and 3 positions.
3. **`apply(...)`:**  Applies the anonymous function to each index obtained from `ofcolor`, generating a set of sets of indices representing the extension of each '2' object.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the set of sets into a single set of indices representing all the extension cells.
5. **`fill(I, 3, ...)`:**  Fills the input grid `I` with the value '3' at the indices obtained in the previous step.

**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by Program A's object iteration and shifting logic)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for j in range(1, 4):
        I = fill(I, 3, shift(toindices(obj), (0, j)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Extract objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **`for obj in objs...`:** Iterates through each extracted object.
3. **`if color(obj) == 2...`:**  Checks if the object's color is '2'.
4. **`for j in range(1, 4)...`:**  Iterates through offsets 1, 2, and 3.
5. **`I = fill(I, 3, shift(toindices(obj), (0, j)))`:**  Shifts the object's indices to the right by `j` positions and fills the corresponding cells in grid `I` with '3'.

**Program Version 3:** (Inspired by Program B's `ofcolor` and using list comprehension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 3, 
              frozenset((i, j + k) 
                      for i, j in ofcolor(I, 2) 
                      for k in range(1, 4)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 2)`:**  Gets indices of cells with color '2'.
2. **`((i, j + k) for i, j in ... for k in range(1, 4))`:**  For each '2' cell index, generates indices shifted rightward by 1, 2, and 3 positions.
3. **`frozenset(...)`:** Converts the generated indices into a frozenset.
4. **`fill(I, 3, ...)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with '3' at the generated indices.

**Program Version 4:** (Using nested loops and conditional filling)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        for k in range(1, 4):
          if j + k < w:
            I = fill(I, 3, frozenset({(i, j + k)}))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:** Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`for i in range(h): ...`:**  Iterates through each row.
3. **`for j in range(w): ...`:** Iterates through each column.
4. **`if I[i][j] == 2: ...`:**  Checks if the cell's value is '2'.
5. **`for k in range(1, 4): ...`:** Iterates through offsets 1, 2, and 3.
6. **`if j + k < w: ...`:** Ensures the offset stays within the grid's bounds.
7. **`I = fill(I, 3, frozenset({(i, j + k)}))`:**  Fills the cell at the offset position with '3'.


**Program Version 5:** (Combining `objects` and `paint` functions)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
      if color(obj) == 2:
        for j in range(1, 4):
          I = paint(I, shift(obj, (0, j)))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Extracts non-background objects from grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objs...`:** Iterates through each extracted object.
3. **`if color(obj) == 2: ...`:**  Checks if the object's color is '2'.
4. **`for j in range(1, 4): ...`:** Iterates through offsets 1, 2, and 3.
5. **`I = paint(I, shift(obj, (0, j)))`:**  Shifts the object rightward by `j` positions and paints it onto the grid `I`.
