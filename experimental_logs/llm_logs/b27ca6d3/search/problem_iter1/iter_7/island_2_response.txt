## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**  The transformation involves identifying each occurrence of the digit '2' in the input grid and drawing a 3x3 square of '3's centered on that '2'. The original '2' remains unchanged.

**Input 1 - Output 1:** The transformation involves identifying each occurrence of the digit '2' in the input grid.  For each '2', a diagonal line of '3's is drawn extending upwards and to the right from that '2' until it hits either an existing digit or the edge of the grid. The original '2' remains unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find all non-background objects
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)

  # 2. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input
  O = I

  # 3. Iterate through each object
  for obj in objs:
    # 4. Get the center of the object
    ci, cj = center(obj)

    # 5. Define the indices to fill with '3'
    fill_indices = frozenset({(ci-1,cj-1),(ci-1,cj),(ci-1,cj+1),
                              (ci,cj-1),(ci,cj+1),
                              (ci+1,cj-1),(ci+1,cj),(ci+1,cj+1)})
    
    # 6. Fill the indices with '3'
    O = fill(O, THREE, fill_indices)
  
  # 7. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify all objects in the input grid that are not the background.
2. **Initialize Output:** We create the output grid as a copy of the input.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** For each object, we find its center and then fill a 3x3 square around it with the value '3'.
4. **Return Output:** Finally, the modified grid is returned.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Define a function to draw a square around a location
  def draw_square(grid, loc):
    i, j = loc
    fill_indices = {(i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1),
                    (i, j-1), (i, j+1),
                    (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)}
    return fill(grid, THREE, fill_indices)
  
  # 2. Find all occurrences of '2'
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, TWO)

  # 3. Apply the 'draw_square' function to each '2' location
  O = I
  for loc in two_indices:
    O = draw_square(O, loc)

  # 4. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** Define a function `draw_square` to draw a 3x3 square of '3's around a given location.
2. **Find '2' Locations:** Identify the indices of all cells containing '2'.
3. **Draw Squares:**  For each '2' location, call `draw_square` to modify the grid.
4. **Return Output:**  Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)

  # 2. Create an empty grid filled with the background color
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))

  # 3. Iterate over all grid cells
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      # 4. If the cell contains a '2'
      if I[i][j] == TWO:
        # 5. Define the square indices
        square_indices = {(i-1,j-1),(i-1,j),(i-1,j+1),
                          (i,j-1),(i,j+1),
                          (i+1,j-1),(i+1,j),(i+1,j+1)}
        
        # 6. Fill the square indices with '3'
        O = fill(O, THREE, square_indices)

        # 7. Paint the '2' back onto the grid
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)}) 

  # 8. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Grid Setup:**  Get the dimensions of the grid and create an empty grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Check:** Iterate through each cell of the grid, checking if it contains a '2'.
3. **Draw and Paint:** If a '2' is found, define the indices of the surrounding square and fill them with '3's. Then, paint the original '2' back onto the grid.
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Define a lambda function to check if a location is within grid boundaries
  in_bounds = lambda loc, h, w: 0 <= loc[0] < h and 0 <= loc[1] < w

  # 2. Get grid dimensions
  h, w = shape(I)

  # 3. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input
  O = I

  # 4. Iterate over all grid cells
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      # 5. If the cell contains a '2'
      if I[i][j] == TWO:
        # 6. Iterate through a 3x3 neighborhood
        for di in range(-1, 2):
          for dj in range(-1, 2):
            # 7. Check if the neighbor is within bounds
            if in_bounds((i + di, j + dj), h, w):
              # 8. Fill the neighbor cell with '3'
              O = fill(O, THREE, {(i + di, j + dj)})

  # 9. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Boundary Check Function:** Create a lambda function `in_bounds` to efficiently check if a given location is within the grid's boundaries.
2. **Grid Setup:** Get the dimensions of the input grid and initialize the output grid as a copy of the input.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** For each cell in the grid, if it contains a '2', iterate over its 3x3 neighborhood.  For each neighbor, use `in_bounds` to ensure it's within the grid, and if so, fill it with '3'.
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Define a function to get the surrounding indices of a location
  def get_surrounding_indices(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return {(i-1,j-1),(i-1,j),(i-1,j+1),
            (i,j-1),(i,j+1),
            (i+1,j-1),(i+1,j),(i+1,j+1)}

  # 2. Find all occurrences of '2'
  two_locs = { (i, j) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == TWO }

  # 3. Get all indices to fill with '3'
  fill_indices = set().union(*[get_surrounding_indices(loc) for loc in two_locs])

  # 4. Fill the indices in the grid
  O = fill(I, THREE, fill_indices)
  
  # 5. Return the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Surrounding Indices Function:**  Define a function `get_surrounding_indices` that returns the eight indices surrounding a given location.
2. **Find '2' Locations:** Find all locations in the grid where the value is '2'.
3. **Get Fill Indices:** Apply `get_surrounding_indices` to each '2' location and take the union of all resulting sets to get all indices to fill.
4. **Fill Grid:** Fill the collected indices in the input grid with the value '3'.
5. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. They showcase the flexibility of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks and provide different ways to think about and manipulate grid-based data.
