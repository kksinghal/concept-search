## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the objects formed by the digit '2' in the input grid and then drawing a specific pattern around each object in the output grid. 

**Input 0:**

- Input: A single cell with the digit '2'.
- Output: A 15x18 grid with the digit '2' at positions (2,2), (8,14), (11,4), (12,0) and (14,14). A pattern of '3's is drawn around the position (2,2) forming a plus sign with a width of 3 cells.

**Input 1:**

- Input: A single cell with the digit '2'.
- Output:  A 15x16 grid with the digit '2' at positions (0,0), (1,0), (4,4), (4,11), (7,1), (9,14), (12,0) and (14,4).  A pattern of '3's is drawn around each of these positions forming a plus sign with a width of 3 cells. Some plus signs overlap and some parts extend beyond the grid boundaries. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (15, 18)) # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False): # Iterate over objects in the input
    i, j = ulcorner(obj) # Get the upper-left corner of the object
    O = paint(O, {(2, (i+2, j+2))}) # Paint the center of the pattern
    for k in range(-1, 2):
      for l in range(-1, 2):
        if abs(k) != abs(l): # Create the plus sign pattern
          O = paint(O, {(3, (i+2+k, j+2+l))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A blank canvas of size 15x18 is created using `canvas(0, (15, 18))`.
2. **Object Iteration:** The code iterates over each object in the input grid using `objects(I, True, False, False)`.
3. **Pattern Drawing:** For each object, it calculates the center of the plus sign pattern and paints it with the digit '2' using `paint(O, {(2, (i+2, j+2))})`.
4. **Plus Sign Construction:** It then draws the '3's around the center to form a plus sign with a width of 3 cells.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (15, 18))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    O = paint(O, {(2, (center_i + 2, center_j + 2))})
    for k in range(5):
      O = paint(O, {(3, (center_i + 2, center_j - 1 + k))})
    for k in range(5):
      O = paint(O, {(3, (center_i - 1 + k, center_j + 2))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version uses `centerofmass(obj)` to find the center of each object.
2. It then directly draws two lines of '3's, one horizontal and one vertical, centered on the calculated center point.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (15, 18))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    center = (i+2, j+2)
    hline = {(3, (center[0], k)) for k in range(center[1]-1, center[1]+4)}
    vline = {(3, (k, center[1])) for k in range(center[0]-1, center[0]+4)}
    O = paint(O, {(2, center)})
    O = paint(O, hline)
    O = paint(O, vline)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version pre-calculates the horizontal and vertical lines of '3's using set comprehensions.
2. This makes the code more concise while achieving the same result.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (15, 18))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i+2, j+2)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((i+1, j+2), (i+3, j+2))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((i+2, j+1), (i+2, j+3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version iterates directly over the input grid cells.
2. It uses `recolor` to efficiently paint the '2' and the lines of '3's using the `connect` function for creating the lines.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (15, 18))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    for k in range(5):
      O = paint(O, {(3, (i+2, j-1+k)) if k != 2 else (2, (i+2, j-1+k))})
      O = paint(O, {(3, (i-1+k, j+2)) if k != 2 else (2, (i-1+k, j+2))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version combines the drawing of '2' and '3' within the same loop iteration.
2. It achieves this by conditionally painting '2' at the center of the plus sign while painting '3' for the rest of the line.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and logic within the constraints of the provided DSL to achieve the same transformation observed in the input-output pairs.
