## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** The single '2' cell in the input grid is duplicated four times and arranged in a rectangular shape at the bottom left corner of the output grid. The three center cells of the rectangle are filled with '3'. 

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**  This transformation is more complex and less intuitive. It seems like the single '2' cell is again duplicated multiple times and arranged in a specific pattern. The placement of '3's seems to relate to the position of the '2' in the input grid, but the exact logic is unclear without further examples.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (15, 16))
  if I[0][0] == 2:
    O = fill(O, 2, {(0, 0), (14, 0), (14, 14), (0, 14)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(1, 1), (13, 1), (13, 13), (1, 13)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program first creates a blank canvas of size 15x16 filled with '0's. It then checks if the input grid's top-left corner contains a '2'. If true, it draws a rectangle of '2's at the corners of the canvas and fills the inner rectangle with '3's. 

**Inspiration:** This version leverages the `canvas` and `fill` functions from the provided examples to efficiently create the output grid. It simplifies the logic by focusing on creating the pattern directly instead of manipulating individual cells.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(canvas(0, (1, 1)), 15)
  if index(I, (0, 0)) == 2:
    O = fill(O, 2, {(0, 0), (14, 0), (14, 14), (0, 14)})
    O = fill(O, 3, box({(1, 1), (13, 13)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version creates a 1x1 grid with '0', upscales it to the desired 15x15 size, then uses the same logic as Version 1 to draw the '2' rectangle and fill the inner rectangle with '3's, utilizing the `box` function for a more concise representation of the inner rectangle indices.

**Inspiration:**  This version builds upon Version 1 by using the `upscale` function to create the initial canvas more concisely. It also utilizes the `box` function to highlight a different approach for defining cell indices.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (15, 16))
  if I[0][0] == 2:
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in (0, 14) for j in (0, 14)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 14) for j in (1, 13)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to previous versions, this program creates a blank 15x16 canvas. If the input grid has '2' in the top-left corner, it fills specific indices with '2' and '3' to generate the desired output. 

**Inspiration:** This version focuses on using set comprehension within the `fill` function to directly define the indices to be filled, offering a more expressive and flexible alternative to manually listing individual coordinates. 


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (15, 16))
  c = I[0][0]
  if c == 2:
    O = fill(O, c, {(0, 0), (14, 0), (14, 14), (0, 14)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 14) for j in range(1, 14) if i != j})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program creates a blank 15x16 canvas and stores the top-left cell value of the input grid in a variable 'c'. If 'c' is '2', it fills specific cells with '2' (using 'c' for dynamic value) and fills the remaining inner cells with '3' except the diagonal.

**Inspiration:** This version introduces a variable to store the input cell value, making the code more adaptable to potential variations in input. It also uses a conditional within the set comprehension to exclude specific cells from being filled.

## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(canvas(0, (1, 1)), 15) 
  if index(I, ORIGIN) == 2:
    O = fill(O, 2, corners(asindices(O)))
    O = underfill(O, 3,  {(i, j) for i in range(1, 14) for j in range(1, 14)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program creates a 1x1 grid with '0', upscales it to 15x15, checks for '2' at the origin of the input, then uses `corners` function to efficiently fill corners with '2' and fills the rest of the grid with '3' using `underfill` to avoid overwriting the corners.

**Inspiration:** This version combines the conciseness of upscaling with the efficiency of `corners` and utilizes `underfill` for a different filling strategy, showcasing the versatility of the DSL.

These five program versions illustrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformations while adhering to the provided DSL. Each version emphasizes distinct aspects of the DSL, showcasing its flexibility and expressiveness in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
