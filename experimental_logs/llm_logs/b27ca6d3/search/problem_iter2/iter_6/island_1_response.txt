## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

The transformation involves the following steps:
1. **Identify the central object:** Find the object formed by connected '2's (using 4-connectivity).
2. **Create a bounding box:**  Construct a bounding box around the central object using the value '3'. The bounding box should be one cell larger than the object on all sides.
3. **Place corner markers:**  Place a '2' at the bottom-right corner of the bounding box and at every other corner of the 18x15 canvas.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

This transformation is similar to the previous one with a slight difference:
1. **Identify the central object:** Find the object formed by connected '2's (using 4-connectivity).
2. **Create a bounding box:** Construct a bounding box around the central object using the value '3'. However, this time, the top and left sides of the bounding box are directly adjacent to the central object, while the bottom and right sides maintain a one-cell distance. 
3. **Place corner markers:** Place a '2' at the bottom-right corner of the bounding box and at every other corner of the 16x15 canvas. 


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find central object
  obj = first(sizefilter(fgpartition(I), colorcount(I, 2)))
  # Create canvas with bounding box dimensions
  O = canvas(0, (height(obj) + 2, width(obj) + 2))
  # Fill bounding box
  O = fill(O, 3, difference(box(asindices(O)), asindices(O)))
  # Place central object
  O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1,1)))
  # Place corner markers
  O = fill(O, 2, {(0,0), (0, width(O)-1), (height(O)-1, 0), (height(O)-1, width(O)-1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find central object:**  `fgpartition` identifies objects, `sizefilter` keeps only objects with the size of the '2' count, and `first` selects the (only) object.
2. **Create canvas:** `canvas` creates a grid of '0's with the required bounding box dimensions.
3. **Fill bounding box:** `fill` places '3's at the bounding box indices calculated by `difference` between the full box and its inner area.
4. **Place central object:** `paint` draws the object on the canvas shifted one cell down and right.
5. **Place corner markers:**  `fill` places '2's at the four corners of the resulting grid. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find central object
  obj = first(sizefilter(fgpartition(I), colorcount(I, 2)))
  # Calculate bounding box corners
  ul = subtract(ulcorner(obj), (1,1))
  lr = add(lrcorner(obj), (1,1))
  # Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, (lr[0]+1, lr[1]+1))
  # Fill bounding box
  O = fill(O, 3, difference(box({ul, lr}), asindices(O)))
  # Place central object
  O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1,1)))
  # Place corner markers
  O = fill(O, 2, {ul, (ul[0], lr[1]), (lr[0], ul[1]), lr})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find central object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate bounding box corners:**  `ulcorner` and `lrcorner` find the object corners, and `subtract`/`add` adjust for the bounding box margins.
3. **Create canvas:**  `canvas` creates a grid based on the calculated bounding box dimensions.
4. **Fill bounding box:** Similar to Version 1, but uses calculated corners for the bounding box.
5. **Place central object:** Same as Version 1.
6. **Place corner markers:**  `fill` places '2's directly at the calculated corner positions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find central object and its bounding box
  obj = first(sizefilter(fgpartition(I), colorcount(I, 2)))
  bbox = backdrop(add(lrcorner(obj), (1, 1)))
  # Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(bbox))
  # Fill bounding box
  O = fill(O, 3, difference(box(asindices(O)), asindices(O)))
  # Place central object
  O = paint(O, shift(obj, subtract(center(bbox), center(obj))))
  # Place corner markers
  O = fill(O, 2, corners(asindices(O)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find central object and bounding box:** Same as Version 2 but calculates the bounding box indices directly using `backdrop`.
2. **Create canvas:**  `canvas` uses the shape of the bounding box indices for grid dimensions.
3. **Fill bounding box:**  Same as Version 2.
4. **Place central object:**  Calculates the shift offset using the difference between the bounding box center and the object center.
5. **Place corner markers:**  `fill` places '2's at the corners of the grid calculated using `corners`. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find central object and background color
  obj = first(sizefilter(fgpartition(I), colorcount(I, 2)))
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  # Create expanded canvas
  O = canvas(bg, add(shape(I), (2, 2)))
  # Place central object
  O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, 1)))
  # Fill bounding box
  O = fill(O, 3, outbox(shift(obj, (1, 1))))
  # Place corner markers
  O = fill(O, 2, corners(asindices(O))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find central object and background color:**  Same as Version 1, additionally identifies the background color.
2. **Create expanded canvas:** `canvas` creates a grid with dimensions larger than the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Place central object:**  The object is placed directly onto the expanded canvas, shifted one cell down and right.
4. **Fill bounding box:** `outbox` is used to determine the indices surrounding the shifted object, which are then filled with '3's.
5. **Place corner markers:** Same as Version 3.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find central object 
  obj = first(sizefilter(fgpartition(I), colorcount(I, 2)))
  # Create canvas with bounding box dimensions
  O = canvas(0, (height(obj) + 2, width(obj) + 3))
  # Fill bounding box 
  O = fill(O, 3, difference(box(asindices(O)), asindices(O)))
  # Place central object
  O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1,1)))
  # Place corner markers
  O = fill(O, 2, {(0,0), (0, width(O)-2), (height(O)-1, 0), (height(O)-1, width(O)-1)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find central object:**  Same as Version 1.
2. **Create canvas:** Same as Version 1, except the width is increased by 3 instead of 2.
3. **Fill bounding box:** Same as Version 1.
4. **Place central object:** Same as Version 1.
5. **Place corner markers:** Similar to Version 1, but the top-right marker is shifted one cell to the left.
