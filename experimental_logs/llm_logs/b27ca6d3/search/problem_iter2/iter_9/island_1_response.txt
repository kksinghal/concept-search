## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples focuses on manipulating the locations of the digit "2" while introducing the digits "3" and "0" to form specific patterns.

**Example 0:**

- The single "2" in the input acts as an anchor point.
- The output is a larger grid filled mostly with "0". 
- A "plus" shape formed by the digit "3" is placed slightly offset from the anchor point.
-  Additional "2"s are strategically positioned at the bottom and top-right corner of the output grid, always maintaining a specific distance from the "plus" shape.

**Example 1:**

- Each "2" in the input serves as an anchor point.
- For every anchor, a "C" shape formed by the digits "3" and "2" is generated, with the open end of the "C" facing the anchor.
- The rest of the grid is filled with "0".

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, add(shape(I), (16, 16))) # Create a canvas with extra space
  for loc in occurrences(I, {(2, (0, 0))}): 
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(3, {(0, 1), (0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1)}), add(loc, (7, 7)))) # Draw the "+" shape
    O = fill(O, 2, add(loc, (2, 2))) # Place the "2" relative to the "+" shape
    O = fill(O, 2, add(loc, (11, 15))) # Place the "2" at the opposite corner
  return crop(O, (2, 2), shape(I)) # Crop to the original input size

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** It creates a larger canvas filled with "0" to accommodate the new pattern.
2. **Anchor Iteration:** It iterates through the locations of "2" in the input grid.
3. **Shape Placement:** It paints a "+" shape using the digit "3" at a calculated offset from each anchor point.
4. **Digit Placement:** It places "2"s at specific locations relative to each "+" shape.
5. **Cropping:** It crops the output to match the dimensions of the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for loc in occurrences(I, {(2, (0, 0))}):
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(3, {(0, -1), (0, -2), (-1, -2), (1, -2), (0, -3)}), add(loc, (0, 13))))
        O = fill(O, 2, add(loc, (1, 13)))
        O = fill(O, 2, add(loc, (2, 15)))
        O = fill(O, 2, add(loc, (12, 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to version 1, but directly constructs the final grid without cropping.
- Uses calculated offsets to place the "C" shapes and additional "2"s based on the anchor locations.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (18, 18))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(3, {(0, 1), (0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1)}), (i + 7, j + 7)))
        O = fill(O, 2, (i + 2, j + 2))
        O = fill(O, 2, (i + 11, j + 15))
  return crop(O, (2, 2), shape(I))
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through every cell in the input grid.
- If a cell contains "2", it triggers the placement of the "+" shape and additional "2"s.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, add(multiply(shape(I), (2, 2)), (-2, -2)))  # Adjust canvas size
    for loc in occurrences(I, {(2, (0, 0))}):
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(3, {(0, 1), (0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1)}), add(multiply(loc, (2, 2)), (3, 3))))  # Scale and shift "+"
        O = fill(O, 2, add(multiply(loc, (2, 2)), (1, 1)))  # Scale and shift the first "2"
        O = fill(O, 2, add(multiply(loc, (2, 2)), (5, 7)))  # Scale and shift the second "2"
    return crop(O, multiply(shape(I), (1, 1)), shape(I))  # Adjust cropping
```

**Explanation:**

- Employs scaling and shifting to achieve the desired output.
-  Calculates new positions for the shapes and digits by scaling the original locations.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  output_shape = (max(len(I) * 2, 16), max(len(I[0]) * 2, 16)) # Calculate dynamic output size
  O = canvas(0, output_shape)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        center_i = i * 2 + 7
        center_j = j * 2 + 7
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(3, {(0, 1), (0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1)}), (center_i, center_j)))
        O = fill(O, 2, (center_i - 5, center_j - 5))
        O = fill(O, 2, (center_i + 3, center_j + 7))
  return crop(O, (4, 4), shape(I))
```

**Explanation:**

- Dynamically calculates the output grid size based on the input dimensions.
- Scales the positioning of elements based on the input size while maintaining the core pattern.
- Uses a center point for each pattern placement and offsets other elements relative to it.

These five programs provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
