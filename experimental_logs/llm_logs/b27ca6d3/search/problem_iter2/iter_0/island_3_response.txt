## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to create a rectangular frame around each '2' digit in the input grid. The frame is constructed using the digit '3', except for the corners where the digit '2' is used. The frame's size and position depend on the location of the '2' digit it encloses.

**Input 0:**

- A single '2' in a 1x1 grid.
- Output:  A 15x18 grid with a frame of '3's and corners of '2's surrounding a central area filled with '0's. 

**Input 1:**

- Multiple '2's scattered in a grid.
- Output: A grid where each '2' from the input is surrounded by a similar frame as in Output 0. The frames are independent and do not merge even if they overlap. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the code to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    corner = ulcorner(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, {(0,0), (4,0), (0,4), (4,4)}), corner))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(3, {(i,j) for i in range(5) for j in range(5) if (i,j) not in {(0,0), (4,0), (0,4), (4,4)}}), corner))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' locations:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all objects with the value '2', excluding the background. 
2. **Initialize Output:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with '0's.
3. **Iterate and Draw Frames:** For each '2' object:
   - `ulcorner(obj)` gets the upper-left corner coordinates.
   - Two `recolor` and `shift` combinations draw the '2' corners and the '3' frame around the '2' at the correct offset from the corner.
   - `paint(O, ...)` adds the frame to the output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (15, 18))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        for x in range(5):
          for y in range(5):
            if (x, y) in [(0,0), (4,0), (0,4), (4,4)]:
              O = paint(O, {(2, (i+x, j+y))})
            else:
              O = paint(O, {(3, (i+x, j+y))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** `canvas(0, (15, 18))` creates an empty 15x18 grid filled with '0's.
2. **Iterate through Input:** Nested loops iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Check for '2':**  If a cell contains '2':
   - Nested loops iterate over a 5x5 area.
   - If the current coordinate is a corner, paint '2', else paint '3'.
   - Use `paint(O, ...)` to draw on the output grid with appropriate offsets.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  two_locations = toindices(objects(I, T, F, T))
  O = canvas(0, add(shape(I), (14, 17)))
  for i in range(len(O)):
    for j in range(len(O[0])):
      if (i-4, j-4) in two_locations:
        if (i in [4, 8] and j in [4, 8]) or (i in [0, 12] and j in [0, 14]):
          O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' locations:** `toindices(objects(I, T, F, T))` gets the indices of all '2' cells.
2. **Create Larger Output:** `canvas(0, add(shape(I), (14, 17)))` creates an output grid larger than the input to accommodate the frames.
3. **Iterate and Check Offsets:** Iterates over the output grid and checks if the current cell's offset from a '2' location corresponds to a corner or frame position.
4. **Paint Accordingly:** Paint '2' for corners, '3' for frame elements.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    twos = objects(I, True, False, True)
    output = canvas(0, (len(I) + 14, len(I[0]) + 17))
    for two in twos:
        corner = ulcorner(two)
        frame = shift(recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(5) for j in range(5)}), corner)
        corners_2 = shift(recolor(2, {(0,0), (4,0), (0,4), (4,4)}), corner)
        output = underpaint(paint(output, frame), corners_2)
    return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2's:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Larger Output:** Similar to Version 3.
3. **Iterate over '2's:**  Iterate through each '2' object.
   - Calculate frame and corner positions relative to the '2'.
   - Draw the entire frame with '3' first.
   - Overwrite the corners with '2' using `underpaint` to avoid overwriting existing frame elements.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def frame(loc):
    return shift(recolor(3, {(i,j) for i in range(5) for j in range(5) if (i,j) not in {(0,0), (4,0), (0,4), (4,4)}}), loc)
  def corners(loc):
    return shift(recolor(2, {(0,0), (4,0), (0,4), (4,4)}), loc)
  locations =  toindices(objects(I, True, False, True))
  O = canvas(0, (len(I) + 14, len(I[0]) + 17)) 
  for loc in locations:
    O = paint(O, frame(loc))
    O = paint(O, corners(loc))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Functions:** Defines `frame` and `corners` functions for clarity.
2. **Find '2' locations:** Similar to Version 3.
3. **Create Output:** Similar to Version 4.
4. **Iterate and Paint:** For each '2' location, paint the frame and then the corners using the helper functions.
