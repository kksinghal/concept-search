1. **Place a green shape:**  A specific green shape is placed at the same row as the red square, but shifted to the right by 7 columns. This shape consists of green squares at coordinates (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (2, 7), and (4, 7).

2. **Place a central red square:** A red square is placed at the same row as the original red square, but shifted 7 columns to the right.

3. **Place additional red squares:**  Four more red squares are placed at specific locations relative to the original red square:
    * Two squares down and six columns to the right.
    * Four squares down and thirteen columns to the right.
    * Eight rows down and in the same column as the original red square.
    * Twelve rows down and sixteen columns to the right.

If there are no red squares in the input grid, the output grid remains blank.
