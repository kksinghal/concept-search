['For each red square, draw a green box that is three squares wide, centered on the red square.', 'Surround each red square with a green box three squares across.', 'Replace the empty squares around each red square with green squares, forming a box three squares wide.', 'For every red square, create a 3x3 green box with the red square in the center.', 'Generate a 3x3 green box around each red square. ']['For every red square, color the squares above, below, left, and right of it green, unless the square is already red. ', 'Extend green lines horizontally from the left and right sides of each red square, stopping if another red square or the edge of the grid is encountered.', 'For each red square, draw a horizontal line of green squares extending to the left and right edges of the grid.', 'Create a green cross shape centered on each red square, extending the arms of the cross until they reach another red square or the edge of the grid.', 'Replace all empty squares directly adjacent to a red square with green squares. ']['The transformation involves identifying the positions of red blocks in the input and replicating them with blue blocks in the output, while introducing a central cluster of green blocks.', 'The rule entails copying the red block pattern from the input to the output using blue blocks and adding a rectangular region of green blocks in the center of the output.', 'The pattern involves transferring the locations of red blocks from the input to the output as blue blocks and generating a central green rectangle in the output.', 'The logic is to map the red block positions from the input to blue blocks in the output and create a green rectangular shape at the center of the output.', 'The transformation consists of replicating the red block arrangement from the input to the output using blue blocks and forming a rectangular green area in the center of the output.
