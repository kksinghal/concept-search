## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The object composed of digit '6' is extended downwards, filling the space below it with its own value. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The object composed of digit '2' is extended downwards, filling the space below it with its own value.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  The object composed of digit '4' is extended downwards, filling the space below it with its own value. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    bottom_right_corner = lrcorner(obj)
    bottom_i, bottom_j = bottom_right_corner
    if bottom_i < len(I) - 1:
      extension = frozenset({(color(obj), (i, bottom_j)) for i in range(bottom_i + 1, len(I))})
      obj = obj | extension
    I = paint(I, obj)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, False, False, True)` finds all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate through objects:** For each object in the grid:
   - **Find bottom-right corner:** `lrcorner(obj)` gets the coordinates of the bottom-right cell.
   - **Check for extension possibility:** If the bottom-right corner is not at the bottom edge of the grid:
     - **Create extension:** `extension` is a set of cells with the object's color, extending downwards from the bottom-right corner to the bottom edge of the grid.
     - **Extend the object:** The object is extended by adding the `extension` to it.
   - **Paint the extended object:** `paint(I, obj)` updates the grid with the extended object.
3. **Return the modified grid:** The function returns the transformed grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for i in range(len(I) - 1, 0, -1):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == mostcommon(I):
        I = fill(I, I[i-1][j], {(i, j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows bottom-up:** `for i in range(len(I) - 1, 0, -1)` iterates through the rows of the grid starting from the second-to-last row upwards.
2. **Iterate through columns:** For each row, `for j in range(len(I[0]))` iterates through all columns.
3. **Check for background color:** If the current cell has the background color (`mostcommon(I)`):
   - **Fill with color above:** `fill(I, I[i-1][j], {(i, j)})` changes the current cell's color to the color of the cell directly above it.
4. **Return the modified grid:** The function returns the transformed grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      if i < len(I) - 1 and I[i+1][j] == mostcommon(I):
        I = fill(I, v, {(k, j) for k in range(i + 1, len(I))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, False, False, True)` finds all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate through objects:** For each object in the grid:
   - **Iterate through object cells:** For each cell `(v, (i, j))` in the object:
      - **Check for extension possibility:** If the cell below is within the grid bounds and has the background color:
        - **Extend downwards:** `fill(I, v, {(k, j) for k in range(i + 1, len(I))})` fills all cells below with the object's color (`v`) until the bottom edge is reached.
3. **Return the modified grid:** The function returns the transformed grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h = height(I)
  for j in range(width(I)):
    current_color = None
    for i in range(h - 1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        current_color = I[i][j]
      if current_color is not None and I[i][j] == mostcommon(I):
        I = fill(I, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** `for j in range(width(I))` iterates through each column of the grid.
2. **Track current color:** `current_color` stores the color of the most recently encountered non-background cell in the current column.
3. **Iterate through rows bottom-up:** For each column, `for i in range(h - 1, -1, -1)` iterates through rows from bottom to top.
   - **Update current color:** If the current cell is not the background color, update `current_color` to the cell's color.
   - **Fill with current color:** If `current_color` is set and the current cell has the background color, fill the current cell with `current_color`.
4. **Return the modified grid:** The function returns the transformed grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    for i in range(len(I) - 1, 0, -1):
      if I[i][j] == mostcommon(I) and I[i-1][j] != mostcommon(I):
        I = fill(I, I[i-1][j], {(k, j) for k in range(i, len(I))})
        break
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** `for j in range(len(I[0]))` iterates through each column of the grid.
2. **Iterate through rows bottom-up:** For each column, `for i in range(len(I) - 1, 0, -1)` iterates through rows from bottom to top.
3. **Check for extension condition:** If the current cell has the background color and the cell above it has a non-background color:
   - **Extend downwards:** `fill(I, I[i-1][j], {(k, j) for k in range(i, len(I))})` fills all cells from the current row downwards with the color of the cell above.
   - **Break inner loop:** `break` stops iterating through the remaining rows in the current column, as the extension is complete.
4. **Return the modified grid:** The function returns the transformed grid.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using various DSL functions and logic. Each version aims to provide a distinct and effective solution to the problem.
