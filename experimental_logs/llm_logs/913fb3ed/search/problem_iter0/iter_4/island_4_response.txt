## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Objects:** The input grid is analyzed to identify distinct objects. An object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same value, excluding the background color (most frequent color).

2. **Object Outlining:**  Each object is outlined with a specific color based on its original color:
   - Objects with color 8 or 3 are outlined with color 6.
   - Objects with color 2 are outlined with color 1.

3. **Object Filling:**
   - Objects with color 8 are filled with color 4.
   - Objects with color 2 are filled with color 1.
   - Additionally, objects with color 8 have four corner pixels with color 1 placed around them at specific offsets.

4. **Output Generation:** The modified objects are painted back onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input, resulting in the output grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    c = color(obj)
    O = paint(fill(O, SIX if c in (EIGHT, THREE) else ONE, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)
    if c == EIGHT:
      O = fill(O, FOUR, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
      for offset in ((TWO, ONE), (ONE, THREE), (TWO, THREE), (ZERO, THREE)):
        O = fill(O, ONE, shift({astuple(*offset)}, ulcorner(toindices(obj))))
    elif c == TWO:
      O = fill(O, ONE, toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each object in the input.
- Outlines the object on a blank canvas (`O`) based on its color.
- Fills objects with color 8 with color 4, leaving the original object intact.
- Adds four corner pixels around objects with color 8.
- Fills objects with color 2 with color 1.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), c):
      O = paint(fill(O, SIX if c in (EIGHT, THREE) else ONE, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)
      if c == EIGHT:
        O = fill(O, FOUR, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, shift({(TWO, ONE), (ONE, THREE), (TWO, THREE), (ZERO, THREE)}, ulcorner(toindices(obj)))))
      elif c == TWO:
        O = fill(O, ONE, toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each color in the input (excluding background).
- Processes all objects of that color together.
- Similar outlining and filling logic as Version 1.
- Uses `recolor` to efficiently handle the corner pixels for objects with color 8.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
        merge(
            apply(
                lambda obj: (
                    paint(
                        fill(
                            I,
                            SIX if color(obj) in (EIGHT, THREE) else ONE,
                            outbox(toindices(obj)),
                        ),
                        obj,
                    )
                    if color(obj) != EIGHT
                    else paint(
                        fill(
                            fill(
                                I,
                                SIX,
                                outbox(toindices(obj)),
                            ),
                            FOUR,
                            difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)),
                        ),
                        recolor(
                            ONE,
                            shift(
                                {(TWO, ONE), (ONE, THREE), (TWO, THREE), (ZERO, THREE)},
                                ulcorner(toindices(obj)),
                            ),
                        ),
                    )
                    if color(obj) != TWO
                    else paint(
                        fill(
                            I,
                            ONE,
                            outbox(toindices(obj)),
                        ),
                        recolor(ONE, obj),
                    )
                ),
                objects(I, True, False, True),
            )
        ),
    )
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes nested functions and `apply` to process objects.
- It outlines and fills objects based on their color using conditional logic within the lambda function.
- This approach eliminates the need for separate loops for colors and objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        O = paint(O, obj)
        if color(obj) != mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, SIX if color(obj) in (EIGHT, THREE) else ONE, outbox(toindices(obj)))
        if color(obj) == EIGHT:
            O = fill(O, FOUR, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
            for offset in ((TWO, ONE), (ONE, THREE), (TWO, THREE), (ZERO, THREE)):
              O = fill(O, ONE, shift({astuple(*offset)}, ulcorner(toindices(obj))))
        elif color(obj) == TWO:
          O = fill(O, ONE, toindices(obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- First paints all the objects on the blank canvas
- Then, It outlines the object on a blank canvas (`O`) based on its color, except for the background color object.
- Fills objects with color 8 with color 4, leaving the original object intact.
- Adds four corner pixels around objects with color 8.
- Fills objects with color 2 with color 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == EIGHT:
          O = paint(fill(O, SIX, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)
          O = fill(O, FOUR, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
          for offset in ((TWO, ONE), (ONE, THREE), (TWO, THREE), (ZERO, THREE)):
            O = fill(O, ONE, shift({astuple(*offset)}, ulcorner(toindices(obj))))
        elif color(obj) == THREE:
          O = paint(fill(O, SIX, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)
        elif color(obj) == TWO:
          O = paint(fill(O, ONE, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)
          O = fill(O, ONE, toindices(obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- First gets all the objects from the input grid.
- Then, on a blank canvas (`O`), for each object, It outlines and fills the objects based on their color.
- This approach separates the outlining and filling logic for different colored objects.

These five programs provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired grid transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version offers a different way of thinking about and implementing the solution, highlighting the creative potential within the provided DSL.
