## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to follow these rules:

* **Outlining:** Objects with colors 8 and 3 are outlined with a 6 border, while objects with color 2 are outlined with a 1 border.
* **Filling 8-objects:**  Objects with color 8 have their interior (excluding the original object) filled with 4. Additionally, specific cells relative to the object's upper-left corner are filled with 1: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (0,3).
* **Filling 2-objects:** Objects with color 2 have their interior filled with 1.


## Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == EIGHT or c == THREE:
      O = paint(fill(O, SIX, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)
    if c == TWO:
      O = paint(fill(O, ONE, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)
      O = fill(O, ONE, toindices(obj))
    if c == EIGHT:
      O = fill(O, FOUR, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
      for offset in ((TWO, ONE), (ONE, THREE), (TWO, THREE), (ZERO, THREE)):
        O = fill(O, ONE, shift(toindices(initset(astuple(*offset))), ulcorner(toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
2. **Outline objects:** 
    * If the object's color is 8 or 3, outline it with 6.
    * If the object's color is 2, outline it with 1.
3. **Fill 8-objects:** 
    * If the object's color is 8:
        * Fill the area inside the outline with 4 using `inbox` and `difference`.
        * Fill the specific cells relative to the object's upper-left corner with 1 using `shift`.
4. **Fill 2-objects:** 
   * If the object's color is 2, fill the object's interior with 1.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    c = color(obj)
    O = paint(O, paint(fill(O, SIX if c in (EIGHT, THREE) else ONE if c == TWO else ZERO, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj))
    if c == EIGHT:
      O = fill(O, FOUR, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
      for offset in ((TWO, ONE), (ONE, THREE), (TWO, THREE), (ZERO, THREE)):
        O = fill(O, ONE, shift(toindices(initset(astuple(*offset))), ulcorner(toindices(obj))))
    elif c == TWO:
      O = fill(O, ONE, toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty canvas `O` with the same shape as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** Loop through each object in the input grid:
   * Determine the outline color based on the object's color using a conditional expression.
   * Paint the object onto the canvas `O` while simultaneously outlining it with the determined color.
3. **Fill Objects:** For each object:
    * If the color is 8:
        * Fill the inside of the outline with 4.
        * Fill specific cells relative to the object's upper-left corner with 1.
    * If the color is 2, fill the object's interior with 1.

## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for c in (EIGHT, THREE, TWO):
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), c):
      outline = SIX if c in (EIGHT, THREE) else ONE
      O = paint(fill(O, outline, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)
      if c == EIGHT:
        O = fill(O, FOUR, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
        for offset in ((TWO, ONE), (ONE, THREE), (TWO, THREE), (ZERO, THREE)):
          O = fill(O, ONE, shift(toindices(initset(astuple(*offset))), ulcorner(toindices(obj))))
      elif c == TWO:
        O = fill(O, ONE, toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate by Color:** Loop through each color (8, 3, and 2) that needs processing.
2. **Filter Objects:** For each color, filter the objects in the input grid that match that color.
3. **Outline and Fill:** 
    * Outline the object with the appropriate color (6 for 8 and 3, 1 for 2).
    * If the color is 8:
        * Fill the inside of the outline with 4.
        * Fill specific cells relative to the object's upper-left corner with 1.
    * If the color is 2, fill the object's interior with 1.

## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def transform_object(obj):
        c = color(obj)
        outline = SIX if c in (EIGHT, THREE) else ONE if c == TWO else ZERO
        obj = paint(fill(I, outline, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)
        if c == EIGHT:
            obj = fill(obj, FOUR, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
            for i, j in ((TWO, ONE), (ONE, THREE), (TWO, THREE), (ZERO, THREE)):
                obj = fill(obj, ONE, shift(toindices(initset(astuple(i, j))), ulcorner(toindices(obj))))
        elif c == TWO:
            obj = fill(obj, ONE, toindices(obj))
        return obj
    return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(apply(transform_object, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `transform_object` Function:** This function takes an object as input and applies the necessary transformations:
    * Determines outline color.
    * Outlines the object.
    * Fills the object based on its color (8 or 2).
2. **Apply Transformation:**
    * Extract all objects from the input grid.
    * Apply the `transform_object` function to each object using `apply`.
    * Merge the transformed objects using `merge`.
    * Paint the merged objects onto an empty canvas and return the result. 

## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def process_color(O, c, fill_color=None, additional_fills=None):
        for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), c):
            O = paint(fill(O, SIX if c in (EIGHT, THREE) else ONE, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)
            if fill_color:
                O = fill(O, fill_color, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
            if additional_fills:
                for offset in additional_fills:
                    O = fill(O, ONE, shift(toindices(initset(astuple(*offset))), ulcorner(toindices(obj))))
        return O
    O = I
    O = process_color(O, EIGHT, FOUR, ((TWO, ONE), (ONE, THREE), (TWO, THREE), (ZERO, THREE)))
    O = process_color(O, THREE)
    O = process_color(O, TWO, ONE)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `process_color` Function:** This function takes the grid, a color, an optional fill color, and optional additional fill locations. It outlines objects of the given color and applies the fills if provided.
2. **Process Each Color:** Call `process_color` for each color (8, 3, 2), providing the appropriate fill parameters for color 8 and 2. 
3. **Return Result:** Return the final grid after processing all colors.

This version modularizes the code by color, making it more organized and potentially easier to extend for additional colors or transformations.
