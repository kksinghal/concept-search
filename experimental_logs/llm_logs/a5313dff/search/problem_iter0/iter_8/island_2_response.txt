## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying the interior cells of each object within the grid and changing their value to 1. The boundary cells of each object remain unchanged. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The large central object has all its internal 0s replaced with 1s.

**Input_1:** The horizontal object in the middle and the vertical object on the right both have their internal 2s replaced with 1s.

**Input_2:** Every object in this more complex grid has its internal cells replaced with 1s, while the shape and border cells remain unchanged.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program utilizing different logic and DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects
  interiors = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)))) #Find interior indices 
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(interiors))  # Fill interior indices with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`mfilter(objs, lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc))))`:** 
    - For each object `obj` in `objs`:
      - `toindices(obj)` gets the indices of all cells in the object.
      - `sfilter` keeps only the indices `loc` where all directly neighboring indices (`dneighbors(loc)`) are also part of the object. This identifies the interior cells.
    - `mfilter` merges the resulting interior indices from all objects.
3. **`fill(I, 1, merge(interiors))`:** Fills the identified interior indices in the input grid `I` with the value 1, creating the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if all((i+di, j+dj) in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):`:** Iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **`for i, j in toindices(obj):`:** Iterates over each cell's index `(i, j)` within the current object.
4. **`if all((i+di, j+dj) in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):`:** Checks if all four direct neighbors of the cell `(i, j)` are also part of the object.
5. **`O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j)})`:** If all neighbors are part of the object (meaning it's an interior cell), the cell in the output grid `O` is filled with the value 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  non_interiors = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: any(n not in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)))) 
  O = fill(I, 1, difference(asindices(I), non_interiors)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Similar to Version 1, this identifies and merges the indices of **non-interior** cells in each object.
3. **`difference(asindices(I), non_interiors)`:** Calculates the difference between all indices in the grid (`asindices(I)`) and the previously identified non-interior indices. This effectively selects all the interior indices.
4. **`fill(I, 1, ...)`:** Fills the selected interior indices in the input grid with 1 to generate the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(1, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, first(obj)[1]), obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(1, shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid `O` of the same size as input `I` and fills it with 1s. 
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):`:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **`index(I, first(obj)[1])`:**  Gets the color of the first cell in the object from the input grid `I`.
4. **`recolor(..., obj)`:** Recolors the object `obj` with the extracted color.
5. **`paint(O, ...)`:**  Paints the recolored object onto the grid `O`, effectively restoring the object's original color but keeping the interior filled with 1s from the initial canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(1 if all((i+di, j+dj) in toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj))) for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]) else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic into a single line using nested list comprehensions:

1. **`for i in range(len(I))`:** Iterates over rows.
2. **`for j in range(len(I[0]))`:** Iterates over columns within each row.
3. **`extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj))`:** Finds the object to which the current cell (i, j) belongs.
4. **`all((i+di, j+dj) in toindices(...) for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)])`:** Checks if all four direct neighbors of the cell are within the same object.
5. **`1 if ... else I[i][j]`:**  If all neighbors are within the same object (interior cell), the output cell is set to 1; otherwise, it retains the original value from the input grid `I`.

These five program versions provide distinct solutions to the given transformation problem using various DSL functions and logic. Choose the one that best suits your needs and coding style.
