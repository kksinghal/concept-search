## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' and then filling the interior of these objects with the digit '1'. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The single '2'-object gets its interior filled with '1'.
**Input_1:** The two '2'-objects, one smaller and one larger, both get their interiors filled with '1'.
**Input_2:**  All the '2'-objects, regardless of their size or shape, have their interiors filled with '1'. 

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == TWO:
            I = fill(I, ONE, inbox(toindices(obj)))
    O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all objects in the grid `I` formed by connected cells of the same value.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The code iterates through each identified object. If the object's color (`color(obj)`) is '2', it fills (`fill`) the inside region of the object (`inbox`) with '1' in the original grid `I`. 
3. **Output:** The modified grid `I` is returned as the output `O`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == TWO and I[i-1][j] == I[i+1][j] == I[i][j-1] == I[i][j+1] == TWO:
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Inner Cells:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid `I`, excluding the border cells.
2. **Check for Interior '2':** For each cell, it checks if the cell's value is '2' and if all its directly adjacent neighbors are also '2'.
3. **Fill Interior:** If the condition is met, it fills the current cell in the output grid `O` with '1'.
4. **Output:**  The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
    twos = ofcolor(I, TWO)
    not_twos = apply(rbind(contained, twos), asindices(I))
    border = sfilter(not_twos, rbind(bordering, I)) 
    to_fill = twos - border
    O = fill(I, ONE, to_fill)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Cells:**  `ofcolor(I, TWO)` identifies all cells in the grid `I` that have the value '2'.
2. **Identify Non-'2' Cells:** `apply(rbind(contained, twos), asindices(I))` finds all the cells in the grid that are not part of the '2'-objects.
3. **Find Border Cells:** `sfilter(not_twos, rbind(bordering, I))` filters the non-'2' cells to get those that are on the border of the grid.
4. **Isolate Interior:** `twos - border`  subtracts the border cells from the set of all '2' cells, leaving only the interior cells.
5. **Fill Interior:** `fill(I, ONE, to_fill)` fills the identified interior cells with '1'.
6. **Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    interior = set()
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == TWO:
            obj_indices = toindices(obj)
            for i, j in obj_indices:
                if all((i + di, j + dj) in obj_indices for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
                    interior.add((i,j))
    O = fill(I, ONE, frozenset(interior))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies objects in the grid `I` like in the previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** It iterates through each object. If the object's color is '2', it checks if each cell within the object has all its four direct neighbors also belonging to the same object. 
3. **Mark Interior:** If a cell meets the neighbor condition, it's added to the `interior` set.
4. **Fill Interior:** Finally, it fills all cells in the `interior` set with '1' in the grid `I`.
5. **Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned. 


**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == TWO:
                if 0 < i < len(I)-1 and 0 < j < len(I[0])-1 and I[i-1][j] == TWO and I[i+1][j] == TWO and I[i][j-1] == TWO and I[i][j+1] == TWO:
                    O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through All Cells:** The code iterates through every cell in the grid `I`.
2. **Check for '2' and Neighbors:**  For each cell containing '2', it verifies if the cell is not on the grid's edge and if all its four immediate neighbors are also '2'.
3. **Fill Interior:** If a cell satisfies the conditions, it is filled with '1' in the output grid `O`.
4. **Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same outcome, each utilizing various DSL functions and logic.
