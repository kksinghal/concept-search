## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid and filling their interior with the value '1', except for the object's original color which remains unchanged. 

Let's break down the transformation for each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The input grid has a single object formed by the value '2'.
* The output grid retains the outline of this object with the value '2'. 
* The interior of the object is filled with the value '1'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The input grid has two objects, both formed by the value '2'.
* Similar to the previous example, the output grid preserves the outline of both objects with the value '2'.
* The interiors of both objects are filled with the value '1'.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The input grid contains multiple objects formed by the value '2'.
* The transformation consistently applies the same logic: preserving the object outlines with the value '2' and filling the interiors with the value '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify all objects in the grid
  for obj in objs:
    inner =  inbox(obj) # Identify the interior of the object
    O = underfill(I, 1, inner)  # Fill the interior with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use the `objects` function to identify all distinct objects within the grid.
2. **Iterate and fill:** For each identified object:
   -  We utilize the `inbox` function to determine the indices of the object's interior.
   -  We apply the `underfill` function to fill the interior indices with the value '1', leaving the original object outline untouched.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify all objects in the grid
    filled_grids = []
    for obj in objs:
        bg = mostcommon(I) # Determine the background color
        filled_grid = fill(I, 1, obj) # Fill the entire object with '1'
        filled_grids.append(filled_grid)
    O = I
    for filled_grid in filled_grids:
        O = cellwise(O, filled_grid, bg) # Restore the original object outlines
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, we begin by identifying all objects in the grid using `objects`.
2. **Fill and Store:** We iterate through each object:
    -  The `fill` function temporarily fills the entire object with the value '1'.
    -  This filled grid is stored for later use.
3. **Restore Outlines:** We iterate through the stored filled grids:
    - The `cellwise` function compares the original grid with each filled grid. 
    - If a cell in the original grid differs from the filled grid, it signifies the object's outline and is preserved. Otherwise, the filled value ('1') is retained.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify all objects in the grid
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    border = difference(box(obj),inbox(obj)) # Identify the border of the object
    O = fill(O, 1, obj) # Fill the entire object with 1
    O = underfill(O, mostcommon(obj), border) # Restore the original object outline
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We identify all objects in the input grid using the `objects` function.
2. **Iterate and Process Objects:** We loop through each identified object.
   - **Extract Border:** We determine the object's border by finding the difference between its bounding box (`box`) and its interior (`inbox`).
   - **Fill Object:** We temporarily fill the entire object with the value '1' using the `fill` function.
   - **Restore Outline:** We utilize `underfill` to restore the object's original color only along the extracted border.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for n in palette(I): # Iterate through all colors present in the grid
        if n != mostcommon(I):
            obj =  objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify all objects
            obj_n = extract(obj, lambda x: color(x) == n) # Extract object with color n
            inner =  inbox(obj_n) # Identify the interior of the object
            O = underfill(O, 1, inner)  # Fill the interior with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Colors:** The program iterates through each unique color (`n`) present in the input grid (`I`) using the `palette` function.
2. **Target Objects:** For each color, it checks if it's the background color (`mostcommon(I)`). If not:
   -  It identifies all objects using `objects` function.
   -  It extracts the object with the current color (`n`) using the `extract` function.
3. **Fill Interior:** Similar to previous versions, the `inbox` function identifies the object's interior, and `underfill` fills it with the value '1'.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify all objects in the grid
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for i, row in enumerate(I): # Loop through rows
            for j, val in enumerate(row): # Loop through columns
                if (i,j) in toindices(obj) and (i,j) not in box(obj):
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j)}) # Fill cell with '1' if inside object but not on the border
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We identify all objects in the grid using the `objects` function.
2. **Iterate Cells:**  The code iterates through every cell in the input grid using nested loops.
3. **Check and Fill:** For each cell with coordinates `(i, j)`:
   - It checks if the cell belongs to the current object (`(i, j) in toindices(obj)`).
   - It also checks if the cell is not part of the object's border (`(i, j) not in box(obj)`).
   - If both conditions are true, indicating an interior cell, it fills that cell with the value '1' using `fill`.

These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL functions. They highlight the flexibility and creativity possible within the constraints of a domain-specific language.
