## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected digits with the same value (excluding the background color, which is the most frequent color in the grid). Then, for each object, the transformation replaces the inner cells of the object with the value '1' while keeping the border cells of the object unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object formed by '2's is identified.
* All the '2's that are not on the border of this object are replaced by '1's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The object formed by '2's is identified.
* All the '2's that are not on the border of this object are replaced by '1's.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The object formed by '2's is identified.
* All the '2's that are not on the border of this object are replaced by '1's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by identifying objects and manipulating indices)

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    for obj in objs:
        indices = toindices(obj)
        inner = indices - box(indices)
        I = fill(I, 1, inner)
    O = I
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects (connected components) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each identified object `obj`.
3. **Get object indices:** `indices = toindices(obj)` retrieves the indices of all cells belonging to the object.
4. **Find inner cells:** `inner = indices - box(indices)` calculates the set of inner cell indices by subtracting the border indices (`box(indices)`) from the object indices.
5. **Fill inner cells:** `I = fill(I, 1, inner)` fills the inner cells with the value '1'.
6. **Output modified grid:** The modified grid `I` is assigned to `O` and returned as the output.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by manipulating objects directly)

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    for obj in objs:
        border = toobject(box(toindices(obj)), I)
        I = cover(I, obj)
        I = paint(I, border)
        I = underfill(I, 1, border) 
    O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Extract border:** `border = toobject(box(toindices(obj)), I)` extracts the border of the object as a new object.
3. **Remove object:** `I = cover(I, obj)` removes the entire object from the grid.
4. **Paint back the border:** `I = paint(I, border)` paints back only the border of the object.
5. **Fill inner area:** `I = underfill(I, 1, border)` fills the area enclosed by the border with '1's, ensuring that no existing non-background cells are overwritten.
6. **Output modified grid:** Same as in Version 1.

**Version 3:** (Utilizing color replacement for efficiency)

```python
def solve(I):
    color = leastcolor(I)
    O = I
    if color != 0:
        O = replace(I, color, 1)
        objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
        for obj in objs:
            border = toobject(box(toindices(obj)), I)
            O = paint(O, border)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object color:** `color = leastcolor(I)` finds the least frequent color in the grid, assuming this represents the object color.
2. **Handle empty object case:** If `color` is 0 (background), no change is needed, and the original grid is returned.
3. **Replace all occurrences:** `O = replace(I, color, 1)` replaces all occurrences of the object color with '1'. 
4. **Identify objects:** Same as in Version 1.
5. **Extract and paint border:** For each object, the code extracts its border (same as Version 2) and paints it back onto the modified grid `O`.

**Version 4:** (Leveraging `cellwise` for a different approach)

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    filled = I
    for obj in objs:
        filled = fill(filled, 1, toindices(obj))
    O = cellwise(I, filled, 0)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Create a filled version:** The code iterates through objects and creates a `filled` grid where all object cells are replaced with '1's.
3. **Apply cellwise comparison:** `O = cellwise(I, filled, 0)` compares the original `I` and `filled` grids cell by cell. If the values match (both are object cells), the original value from `I` is kept. Otherwise, 0 (background) is used, effectively preserving only the border.

**Version 5:** (Combining `downscale` and `upscale` for a unique solution)

```python
def solve(I):
    O = downscale(I, 2)
    O = upscale(O, 2)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Downscale the grid:** `O = downscale(I, 2)` downscales the grid by a factor of 2. This has the effect of removing single-cell details, effectively removing the inner cells of objects.
2. **Upscale the grid:** `O = upscale(O, 2)` upscales the grid back to its original size. Since the downscaling removed the inner cells, upscaling will fill those areas with the background color, achieving the desired effect. 

This approach relies on the assumption that the background color is dominant and will be used to fill the gaps created by downscaling.
