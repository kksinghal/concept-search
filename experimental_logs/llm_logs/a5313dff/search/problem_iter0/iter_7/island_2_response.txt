## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and filling their "interior" with the value 1. An object's interior consists of cells completely surrounded by other cells of the same object. 

**Example:**

In Input_0, the object formed by the digit '2' has its interior filled with '1' in Output_0.

This transformation applies to all input-output pairs, targeting objects regardless of their shape or position.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" implemented using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects from the grid
  interiors = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc))))  # Find interior indices of each object
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(interiors))  # Fill the interior indices with 1
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected components in the grid as individual objects. 
2. **Find Interiors:** 
   - `mfilter` iterates through each object and applies the lambda function.
   -  The lambda function uses `sfilter` to filter an object's indices (`toindices(obj)`) by checking if all its direct neighbors (`dneighbors(loc)`) belong to the same object. This effectively identifies the interior cells.
3. **Fill Interiors:** `fill(I, 1, merge(interiors))` fills the identified interior indices with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in objs:
    interior = sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: all(neighbor in toindices(obj) for neighbor in dneighbors(loc)))  # Find interior indices
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, interior)) # Paint the interior with 1
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint the original object on top
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on cell values.
2. **Empty Canvas:** `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the most common color.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`):
   - **Find Interior:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies the interior indices.
   - **Paint Interior:** `recolor(1, interior)` creates a new object representing the interior with value '1'. This object is then painted onto the canvas.
   - **Paint Object:** The original object (`obj`) is painted over the interior, preserving the original object's boundaries.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize the output as a copy of the input
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Extract objects
  for obj in objs:
    border = difference(toindices(obj), sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)))) # Find border indices
    O = fill(O, 1, difference(toindices(obj), border)) # Fill the non-border indices with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy Input:** `O = I` initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
2. **Extract Objects and Iterate:**  Similar to previous versions, it extracts objects and iterates through them.
3. **Find Border:** This version identifies the object's border by finding the difference between all its indices and its interior indices.
4. **Fill Non-Border:** `fill(O, 1, difference(toindices(obj), border))` fills all indices belonging to the object but not part of the border with the value '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    changed = T
    O = I
    while changed:
        changed = F
        for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
            for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
                if I[i][j] != 0 and all(I[i+di][j+dj] == I[i][j] for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j)})
                    changed = T
        I = O
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version uses a iterative approach to find and fill the interior points:
1. **Iterate over inner grid:** It iterates over the inner grid, excluding the border rows and columns.
2. **Check neighbors:** For each cell it checks if all the direct neighbors have the same value.
3. **Fill and Update:** If the condition is met, it fills the cell with "1" and mark `changed` to `True`, indicating that the grid has been modified.
4. **Repeat:** This process will be repeated until no more cells are being filled.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) and all(I[i+di][j+dj] == I[i][j] for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)] if 0 <= i+di < len(I) and 0 <= j+dj < len(I[0])):
                O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i,j))})
            else:
                O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i,j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Similar to version 2, it creates an empty canvas with the most common color.
2. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid. For each cell, it checks if it's not the background color and all its neighbors (within the grid boundaries) have the same color. 
3. **Conditional Painting:**
   - If the conditions are met, it means the cell is an interior point, so only the cell itself is painted onto the canvas.
   - Otherwise, the cell is either a border point or background, and it's painted onto the canvas with its original value.


Each version effectively achieves the desired transformation by implementing slightly different logic or utilizing different DSL function combinations. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for tackling this spatial reasoning task.
