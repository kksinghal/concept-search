## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying connected regions of non-zero digits in the input grid and then filling the interior cells of these regions with the digit '1'. The exterior shape and the digits on the boundary of these connected regions remain unchanged.

**Illustrative Examples:**

* **Input_0:** A single connected region of '2's is identified. The interior cells of this region are filled with '1's.
* **Input_1:** Two connected regions are present - one with '2's and another with '1's. The interior of both these regions is filled with '1's.
* **Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, multiple connected regions are processed, and their interiors are filled with '1's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if len(obj) > 1:
      for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
        if (i, j) not in box(obj):
          O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  The `objects` function identifies connected regions (objects) of non-zero values in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  The program iterates through each object. For objects with more than one cell, it checks if each cell is an interior cell (not on the bounding box of the object) using `box`. If it's an interior cell, it's painted with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if len(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, inbox(obj)))
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Empty Canvas:** An empty canvas `O` is created with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify and Fill:** Connected regions (objects) are identified. For objects larger than one cell, their `inbox` (interior bounding box) is filled with '1's on the canvas.
3. **Paint Objects:** The original objects from the input grid are then painted onto the canvas, effectively overwriting the '1' fill in the exterior cells. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if len(obj) > 1:
      for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
        neighbors_bg = [(i + di, j + dj) for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)] if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) and I[i + di][j + dj] == 0]
        if len(neighbors_bg) == 0:  # Check if cell has any background neighbors
          O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** This version iterates through connected regions (objects) similar to the previous versions.
2. **Check for Background Neighbors:** For each cell within an object, it checks if any of its direct neighbors are background cells (value 0).
3. **Fill Interior Cells:** If a cell has no background neighbors, it implies it's an interior cell and gets filled with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        if (i == 0 or I[i - 1][j] == 0) or (i == len(I) - 1 or I[i + 1][j] == 0) or (j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] == 0) or (j == len(I[0]) - 1 or I[i][j + 1] == 0):
          O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:**  Iterates through every cell in the grid.
2. **Boundary Condition:** Checks if a cell is on the grid boundary or if any of its direct neighbors are background cells. If true, it's a boundary cell and retains its original value.
3. **Fill Interior:**  If the cell is not a boundary cell, it's considered an interior cell and is filled with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != 0 and I[i-1][j] != 0 and I[i+1][j] != 0 and I[i][j-1] != 0 and I[i][j+1] != 0:
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** The program iterates through the grid, excluding boundary cells. For each non-zero cell, it checks if all its direct neighbors are also non-zero. 
2. **Fill Interior:** If a cell and all its immediate neighbors are non-zero, it indicates an interior cell and is filled with '1'.
