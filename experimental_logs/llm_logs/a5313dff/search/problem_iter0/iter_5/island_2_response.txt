## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing the interior cells of each connected component (excluding single-cell components) with the value '1'. The exterior and single-cell components retain their original values. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The single 2-valued object has its interior filled with 1s while the background and object boundary remain unchanged.

**Pair 1:** Similar to pair 0, the interior of the 2-valued object is filled with 1s. The isolated 2-valued cells remain unchanged. 

**Pair 2:**  Again, the interiors of all connected 2-valued components are filled with 1s. Single 2-valued cells and the background remain unaffected.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) 
  interiors = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and not bordering(obj, I)) 
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(interiors))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, T, F, F)` to identify connected components (objects) in the grid 'I'. The parameters ensure we consider objects with the same value, no diagonal connections, and include the background.
2. **Find Interiors:**  `mfilter` filters the objects to select only those that have more than one cell (`size(obj) > 1`) and are not bordering the grid boundary (`not bordering(obj, I)`). This identifies the objects with interiors.
3. **Fill Interiors:** The `merge` function combines the indices of all interior objects. Finally, `fill(I, 1, merge(interiors))` fills the identified interior indices with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)
    x2 = apply(toindices, x1)
    x3 = mfilter(x2, lambda x: size(x) > 1)
    x4 = apply(inbox, x3)
    O = underfill(I, 1, merge(x4))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Connected Components:** We use `objects(I, T, F, F)` to get all connected components in the grid.
2. **Extract Indices:** `apply(toindices, x1)` extracts the indices of each connected component.
3. **Filter Large Components:**  We keep only components with more than one cell using `mfilter(x2, lambda x: size(x) > 1)`.
4. **Calculate Inboxes:** For each remaining component, `apply(inbox, x3)` calculates its interior bounding box (excluding the boundary).
5. **Fill Inboxes:** Finally, `underfill(I, 1, merge(x4))` fills the merged inboxes with '1' while keeping the existing non-background values.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = partition(I)
    x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda o: size(o) > 1)
    x3 = mapply(delta, x2)
    O = underfill(I, 1, merge(x3))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Grid:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on cell values.
2. **Select Non-Single Cell Objects:** `sfilter(x1, lambda o: size(o) > 1)` filters for objects with more than one cell.
3. **Find Interior Boundaries:**  `mapply(delta, x2)` finds the cells that are part of the bounding box but not the object itself (effectively the interior boundary) for each selected object.
4. **Fill Interior Boundaries:** `underfill(I, 1, merge(x3))` fills these boundary cells with '1' without overwriting existing foreground values.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, True, False, False)
    x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)
    x3 = mapply(lambda obj: difference(backdrop(obj), obj), x2)
    O = underfill(I, 1, merge(x3))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, we identify connected components with `objects(I, True, False, False)`.
2. **Filter Objects by Size:** We keep only the objects with more than one cell using `sfilter(x1, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`.
3. **Find Interior Cells:** For each object, we calculate the difference between its bounding box (`backdrop(obj)`) and the object itself (`obj`), resulting in the interior cells. 
4. **Fill Interior Cells:** Finally, we fill the identified interior cells with '1' using `underfill(I, 1, merge(x3))`, preserving the original object boundaries and background.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, F) 
    x2 = apply(toindices, x1) 
    x3 = mfilter(x2, lambda ind: size(ind) > 1 and all(not bordering(initset(loc), I) for loc in ind))
    O = fill(I, 1, merge(x3))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Connected Components:** We use `objects(I, T, F, F)` to find all connected components.
2. **Extract Indices:** `apply(toindices, x1)` converts the objects into sets of cell indices.
3. **Filter Interior Indices:**  We use `mfilter` with a lambda function to keep only indices belonging to components with more than one cell (`size(ind) > 1`) where all member cells are not on the grid's border (`all(not bordering(initset(loc), I) for loc in ind)`).
4. **Fill Interior Cells:**  We use `fill(I, 1, merge(x3))` to replace the original values at the filtered interior indices with '1'.
