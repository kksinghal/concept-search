## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation fills the inner cavities of connected components (objects) in the input grid with the value '1'. The connected components are determined considering only direct neighbors (no diagonals). 

Let's break it down for each example:

**Input 0:** 
* The '2's form a single connected component with a cavity in the middle.
* The transformation fills this cavity with '1's.

**Input 1:**
* There are two connected components formed by '2's.
* The larger component has a cavity that is filled with '1's.
* The smaller component (single '2' at the top) remains unchanged as it has no inner cavity.

**Input 2:**
* Again, there are two connected components formed by '2's.
* Both components have inner cavities that are filled with '1's.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_539a4f51(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) 
  filled_indices = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    bbox = backdrop(obj)
    for i, j in bbox:
      if (i, j) not in toindices(obj) and all((i + di, j + dj) not in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)] if (i + di, j + dj) in bbox):
        filled_indices = insert((i, j), filled_indices)
  O = fill(I, 1, filled_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` extracts connected components ('2's in this case).
2. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Bounding Box:** `backdrop(obj)` calculates the bounding box of the current object.
4. **Check Cavity:**  For each cell within the bounding box:
   - It checks if the cell is not part of the object (`(i, j) not in toindices(obj)`).
   - It verifies if all its direct neighbors are also not part of the object, ensuring it's an enclosed cavity.
5. **Fill Cavity:** If a cell meets the cavity conditions, its index is added to `filled_indices`.
6. **Apply Filling:** Finally,  `fill(I, 1, filled_indices)` fills all the identified cavity indices with '1' in the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_539a4f51(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  cavity_indices = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(obj) - toindices(obj), objs)
  cavity_indices = sfilter(cavity_indices, lambda loc: all((i + di, j + dj) not in toindices(obj) for obj in objs for i, j in [loc] for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)] if (i + di, j + dj) in backdrop(obj)))
  O = fill(I, 1, cavity_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Extract Potential Cavities:** `mapply` applies a lambda function to each object to find the difference between its bounding box and its actual indices, giving potential cavity indices.
3. **Filter Cavities:** `sfilter` refines the cavity indices by checking if all their direct neighbors are outside any object's indices.
4. **Apply Filling:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_539a4f51(I):
  def is_cavity(loc, obj):
    return loc not in toindices(obj) and all((i + di, j + dj) not in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)] if (i + di, j + dj) in backdrop(obj))

  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  cavity_indices = mfilter(lambda obj: frozenset(loc for loc in backdrop(obj) if is_cavity(loc, obj)), objs)
  O = fill(I, 1, cavity_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Helper Function:** `is_cavity` checks if a given location is within an object's cavity.
3. **Find Cavities:** `mfilter` applies the `is_cavity` function to each location within each object's backdrop to identify cavity indices.
4. **Apply Filling:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_539a4f51(I):
  def is_boundary(loc, obj):
    return loc in toindices(obj) and any((i + di, j + dj) not in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)] if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]))

  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  boundary_indices = mfilter(lambda obj: frozenset(loc for loc in toindices(obj) if is_boundary(loc, obj)), objs)
  cavity_indices = mfilter(lambda loc: all(loc not in dneighbors(b_loc) for b_loc in boundary_indices), asindices(I))
  O = fill(I, 1, cavity_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Helper Function:** `is_boundary` checks if a given location is on the boundary of an object.
3. **Find Boundaries:** `mfilter` identifies the boundary cells of each object.
4. **Find Cavities:** `mfilter` identifies cavity indices by finding cells not directly neighboring any boundary cell.
5. **Apply Filling:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_539a4f51(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  cavities = mfilter(lambda obj: sfilter(lambda loc: all((i + di, j + dj) not in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)] if (i + di, j + dj) in backdrop(obj)), difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))), objs)
  O = fill(I, 1, cavities)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Cavities:**  Uses nested `mfilter` and `sfilter` to directly identify cavity indices within the difference between the object's bounding box and its actual indices, checking for the enclosed condition.
3. **Apply Filling:** Same as Version 1.
