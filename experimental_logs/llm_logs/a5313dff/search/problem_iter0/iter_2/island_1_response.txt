## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the interior cells of each connected component (object) in the input grid and changing their values to 1. The border cells of the objects retain their original values. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The input grid has one object formed by the digit '2'.
- The output grid replaces the interior '2's with '1's, leaving the border '2's unchanged.

**Input_1:**

- The input grid has one object formed by the digit '2'.
- Similar to Input_0, the output grid replaces the interior '2's with '1's.

**Input_2:**

- The input grid has one object formed by the digit '2'.
- The transformation remains consistent, replacing only the interior '2's with '1's.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if len(dneighbors((i,j)) & toindices(obj)) == 4:
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i,j)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected components in the grid.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object (`obj`) in the `objs` set.
3. **Iterate Cells:** Loop through each cell (`(v, (i, j))`) within the current object.
4. **Check for Interior:** If a cell has all four direct neighbors belonging to the same object (`len(dneighbors((i,j)) & toindices(obj)) == 4`), it's considered an interior cell.
5. **Fill Interior:** Fill the interior cell with value '1' using `I = fill(I, 1, {(i,j)})`.
6. **Output:**  Return the modified grid (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(I) - 1):
      if index(I,(i,j)) != mostcolor(I) and all(index(I, loc) == index(I, (i,j)) for loc in dneighbors((i, j))):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Grid:**  Loop through each cell of the grid, excluding the border cells.
2. **Check for Non-Background and Same-Colored Neighbors:**  If a cell is not the background color and all its direct neighbors have the same color, it's an interior cell.
3. **Fill Interior:** Fill the interior cell with '1'.
4. **Output:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    interior = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        for cell in toindices(obj):
            if len(dneighbors(cell) - toindices(obj)) == 0:
                interior = interior | {cell}
    O = fill(I, 1, interior)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find connected components.
2. **Find Interior Cells:**  For each object, identify cells whose direct neighbors all belong to the same object, marking them as interior cells.
3. **Fill Interior:** Fill all identified interior cells with '1'.
4. **Output:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(1, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if any(index(I,loc) != index(I, (i,j)) for loc in dneighbors((i,j))):
        O = fill(O, index(I,(i,j)), {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Filled Canvas:** Initialize a canvas filled with '1' and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate Grid:** Loop through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Check for Border:** If a cell has any direct neighbors with a different color, it's considered a border cell.
4. **Fill Border:** Fill the corresponding cell in the output canvas with the color of the border cell in the input grid.
5. **Output:**  Return the canvas, which now has the desired transformation.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if all((i+di, j+dj) in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Objects:**  Iterate over each object in the input grid.
2. **Iterate Cells:** For each cell within an object, check if all its direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) belong to the same object.
3. **Fill Interior Cells:** If all neighbors belong to the same object, fill that cell with '1'.
4. **Output:**  Return the modified grid. 

Each of these programs provides a different approach to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of the provided DSL.
