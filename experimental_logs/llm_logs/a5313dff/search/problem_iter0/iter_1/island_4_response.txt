## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by the digit "2" in the input grid. Here's a breakdown:

**General Rule:** All cells within an object made of "2" are changed to "1", except for the cells located on the outer perimeter of the object.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The single object formed by "2" has its inner cells changed to "1", while the outer layer remains "2".
* **Input_1:** The same rule applies; inner "2"s become "1", outer "2"s remain unchanged. 
* **Input_2:**  Even with multiple objects and varying object shapes, the inner "2"s are replaced with "1"s, and the perimeter remains "2".

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct code versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, TWO)  # Get indices of all '2's
  obj_indices = toindices(objects(I, T, F, F)[0])  # Get indices of the first object (assuming single object)
  inner_twos = difference(twos, box(obj_indices))  # Find '2's not on the bounding box
  O = fill(I, ONE, inner_twos)  # Fill inner '2's with '1'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2's:** `ofcolor(I, TWO)` finds the indices of all cells containing the value "2".
2. **Isolate Object:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts objects from the grid. Assuming a single object, we take the first one `[0]` and extract its indices using `toindices`.
3. **Find Inner Cells:** `box(obj_indices)` finds the indices forming the object's bounding box (its perimeter).  `difference(twos, box(obj_indices))` keeps only the indices that belong to "2" but are not part of the perimeter. 
4. **Fill with '1':** `fill(I, ONE, inner_twos)` changes the value of the inner "2" cells to "1".

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects 
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == TWO:  # Check if the object is made of '2's
      perimeter = box(toindices(obj))  # Get perimeter indices
      inner_cells = difference(toindices(obj), perimeter)  # Get inner cell indices
      O = fill(O, ONE, inner_cells)  # Fill inner cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts all distinct objects from the grid.
2. **Iterate and Process:** Loop through each extracted object (`obj`). 
3. **Target '2' Objects:** If `color(obj)` is "2", proceed with the transformation.
4. **Find Inner Cells:** Similar to Version 1, calculate the perimeter (`box`) and find the difference to get inner cell indices.
5. **Fill and Update:** Fill inner cells with "1" and update the output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):  # Iterate through rows (excluding borders)
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):  # Iterate through columns (excluding borders)
      if I[i][j] == TWO and (I[i-1][j] == TWO or I[i+1][j] == TWO or I[i][j-1] == TWO or I[i][j+1] == TWO):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})  # If cell is '2' and has adjacent '2', fill with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate within Borders:** Loop through rows and columns, excluding the grid's outer edges.
2. **Check for '2' and Neighbors:**  If a cell's value is "2" and at least one of its directly adjacent neighbors is also "2", it's an inner cell.
3. **Fill with '1':**  Fill the identified inner cell with "1". 

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, TWO)  # Get indices of '2's
  not_border = apply(lambda loc: not bordering(frozenset({loc}), I), twos)  # Check if each '2' is not on the border
  inner_twos = sfilter(twos, lambda loc: not_border[totuple(twos).index(loc)]) 
  O = fill(I, ONE, inner_twos)  # Fill the inner '2's with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2's:** Identify indices of cells containing "2".
2. **Check Border Status:** For each '2' index, create a single-element patch (`frozenset({loc})`) and use `bordering` to check if it lies on the grid's border.  Store the results in `not_border`.
3. **Filter Inner '2's:** Use `sfilter` to keep only the '2' indices where the corresponding `not_border` value is True (meaning it's not on the border).
4. **Fill with '1':**  Fill the inner "2" cells with "1". 

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract objects
  O = I  # Initialize output
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == TWO: 
      obj_indices = toindices(obj)
      shifted_objs = [shift(obj_indices, d) for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]]  # Generate shifted object indices
      intersection = functools.reduce(intersection, shifted_objs + [obj_indices])  # Find common indices
      O = fill(O, ONE, intersection) # Fill common indices with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Get individual objects from the grid.
2. **Iterate and Check Color:** Loop through each object and proceed if it's made of '2's.
3. **Shift and Intersect:**  Create four shifted versions of the object's indices (up, down, left, right).  Find the intersection of all shifted versions and the original indices; the intersection represents the inner cells.
4. **Fill with '1':**  Fill the identified inner cells with "1".
