## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to fill the inner part of each object with the value '1', keeping the outer border of the object intact. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
The single object (digit '2') is filled with '1' except for the outer border cells.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
Both objects (digit '2') are filled with '1' except for their respective outer border cells.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** 
All three objects (digit '2') are filled with '1' except for their respective outer border cells.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**
```python
def jaffjfbcijefeiebbdgdaegbcfibegca(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify all objects in the grid
    filled_grids = []
    for obj in objs:
        bg = mostcolor(I) # Determine the background color
        filled_grid = fill(I, 1, inbox(obj)) # Fill the inbox of the object with '1'
        filled_grids.append(filled_grid)
    O = I
    for filled_grid in filled_grids:
        O = cellwise(O, filled_grid, bg) # Restore the original object outlines
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all unique objects within the grid using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Loop through each object. For every object:
    - Determine the background color using `mostcommon(I)`.
    - Fill the inbox of the object (area within the border) with '1' using `fill(I, 1, inbox(obj))`.
    - Store the filled grid.
3. **Restore Outlines:** Iterate through the filled grids and use `cellwise` to restore the original object outlines while keeping the filled inboxes.

**Program Version 2:**
```python
def ehhccjbibidaefefbcedffcbaacdfgaa(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify all objects in the grid
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    border = difference(box(obj),inbox(obj)) # Identify the border of the object
    O = fill(O, 1, obj) # Fill the entire object with 1
    O = underfill(O, index(I, first(border)), border) # Restore the original object outline
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all unique objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Modify:**  For each object:
    - Determine the object's border by finding the difference between its box and inbox: `difference(box(obj),inbox(obj))`.
    - Fill the entire object with '1' using `fill(O, 1, obj)`.
    - Restore the original object's border by underfilling the border cells with their original color from the input grid using `underfill(O, index(I, first(border)), border)`.

**Program Version 3:**
```python
def solve_program_3(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        inner = difference(obj, box(obj))  # Find the inner part of the object
        O = fill(O, 1, inner)  # Fill the inner part with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Direct Fill:** This version directly identifies and fills the inner part of each object with '1':
   - `difference(obj, box(obj))` isolates the inner cells by removing the border cells.
   - `fill(O, 1, inner)` then fills these inner cells with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**
```python
def solve_program_4(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if all((i + di, j + dj) not in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]):
          O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, j)})
        else:
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Through Cells:** This version iterates directly through each cell of each object.
2. **Check for Border:** For every cell, it checks if it's a border cell by seeing if any of its direct neighbors are not part of the object. 
3. **Fill Accordingly:** If it's a border cell, it keeps its original color; otherwise, it's filled with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def solve_program_5(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    O = canvas(1, shape(I))  # Create a canvas filled with '1'
    for obj in objs:
        O = underpaint(O, toobject(box(obj), I)) # Paint the object border over the canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Canvas of Ones:** It creates a canvas the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with '1'.
2. **Paint Borders:**  Then, it iterates through each object and paints only the border cells of the object onto the canvas, effectively overwriting the '1's in those positions. This leaves the inner part of the objects filled with '1' from the initial canvas.
