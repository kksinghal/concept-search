## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation fills the interior of each object (excluding the border cells) with the value **1**. 

**Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The '2' object's interior is filled with '1'.
* **Input_1:**  The interior of both '2' objects is filled with '1'. 
* **Input_2:** The interiors of all '2' objects are filled with '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using only functions from the provided DSL (dsl.py). Each version provides a unique approach to achieve the desired transformation.


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    border = box(indices)
    interior = difference(indices, border)
    O = fill(O, 1, interior)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It first identifies all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, True, False, True)`. 
2. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates through each object (`obj`) and performs the following:
    - Extracts the indices of the object using `toindices(obj)`.
    - Determines the border indices of the object using `box(indices)`.
    - Calculates the interior indices by finding the difference between the object indices and the border indices using `difference(indices, border)`.
    - Fills the interior indices with the value '1' using `fill(O, 1, interior)`.
3. **Return Output:** Finally, it returns the modified grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(1, height(I)-1):
        for j in range(1, width(I)-1):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and all(index(I, (ni, nj)) == index(I, (i, j)) for ni, nj in dneighbors((i, j))):
                O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Inner Cells:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`, excluding the border cells.
2. **Check for Non-Background and Same-Colored Neighbors:** For each cell, it checks if:
    - The cell's value is not the background color (`mostcolor(I)`).
    - All directly adjacent neighbors (`dneighbors((i, j))`) have the same color as the current cell.
3. **Fill Interior Cell:** If both conditions are true, it means the cell is an interior cell of an object, and it fills that cell with '1' using `fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})`.
4. **Return Output:** It returns the modified grid `O`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if all((ni, nj) in toindices(obj) for ni, nj in dneighbors((i, j))):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Like previous versions, it starts by identifying objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate through Object Cells:** It iterates through each cell (`i, j`) belonging to an object.
3. **Check for Interior:** It checks if all directly adjacent neighbors of the cell are also part of the same object. If true, the cell is an interior cell.
4. **Fill Interior Cell:** It fills the identified interior cell with '1'.
5. **Return Output:** The modified grid is returned.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    interiors = mapply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj))), objs)
    return fill(I, 1, merge(interiors))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Interiors:** This version efficiently calculates the interior indices of all objects at once:
    - `objects(...)` identifies the objects.
    - `mapply(...)` applies a lambda function to each object to find the difference between its indices and its border indices, effectively calculating the interior indices for all objects.
2. **Fill Interiors:** It directly fills all the collected interior indices with '1' using a single call to `fill(...)`.
3. **Return Output:** The modified grid is returned. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(1, shape(I))  # Start with a canvas filled with '1'
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        O = underpaint(O, obj)  # Paint the original object colors back onto the canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Filled Canvas:** It creates a new grid `O` with the same shape as the input, filled entirely with '1's.
2. **Paint Objects Back:** It iterates through each object in the original grid and uses `underpaint` to paint the object's original colors back onto the canvas `O`. Since `underpaint` only paints on cells with the background color (which is '1' in this case), it effectively keeps the interior filled with '1' while restoring the original object borders.
3. **Return Output:**  The modified canvas `O` is returned as the final output.


These five versions demonstrate different strategies for achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
