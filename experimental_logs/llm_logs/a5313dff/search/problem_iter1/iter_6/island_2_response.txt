## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the "interior" cells of each object in the grid and recolor them with the value 1. An interior cell is defined as a cell that belongs to an object and has all its directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) also belonging to the same object. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

- The input grid has a single object formed by the digit '2'.
- The four central '2's are identified as interior cells, as all their adjacent neighbors are also '2'.
- These interior cells are recolored to '1' in the output grid.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

- The input grid has two objects, one formed by '2's and another by a single '0'. 
- The three central '2's in the larger object are identified as interior cells.
- The single '0' object has no interior cells as it doesn't have any neighbors belonging to the same object.
- Only the identified interior cells of the larger object are recolored to '1' in the output grid.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

- This input showcases the transformation with multiple disconnected objects formed by the digit '2'.
- For each object, the interior cells are identified based on the adjacency rule.
- All identified interior cells across different objects are then recolored to '1' in the output grid.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_interior(cell, obj_indices):
    return contained(cell, obj_indices) and all(contained(n, obj_indices) for n in dneighbors(cell))

  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  interior_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    obj_indices = toindices(obj)
    for cell in obj_indices:
      if is_interior(cell, obj_indices):
        interior_cells.add(cell)
  return fill(I, 1, frozenset(interior_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_interior(cell, obj_indices)` function:** This function checks if a given `cell` is an interior cell within the provided `obj_indices`. It ensures the cell is part of the object and all its direct neighbors are also within the `obj_indices`.
2. **Object Extraction:** `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` extracts objects from the input grid.
3. **Iterating Objects:** The program iterates through each extracted object.
4. **Iterating Cells:** For each object, it iterates through its cells and checks if the cell is an interior cell using `is_interior`. 
5. **Filling Interior Cells:** If a cell is identified as an interior cell, it's added to the `interior_cells` set. Finally, the input grid is filled with '1' at these `interior_cells` locations.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    interior_cells = set()
    for obj in objs:
        for c in toindices(obj):
            neighbors_in_obj = dneighbors(c) & toindices(obj)
            if len(neighbors_in_obj) == len(dneighbors(c)):
                interior_cells.add(c)
    return fill(I, 1, frozenset(interior_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extracts objects from the input grid using `objects`.
2. **Iterating and Checking Neighbors:** Iterates through each object and its cells. For each cell, it calculates the intersection between its direct neighbors and the object's indices. If all direct neighbors are within the object, it's an interior cell.
3. **Filling Interior Cells:** Identified interior cells are added to the `interior_cells` set and finally filled with '1' on the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  interior_cells = mapply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), box(obj)), objs)
  return fill(I, 1, toindices(merge(interior_cells)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extracts objects using the `objects` function.
2. **Identifying Interior Cells:** Calculates the difference between an object's indices and its bounding box using `difference(toindices(obj), box(obj))`.  This identifies potential interior cells. 
3. **Merging and Filling:** Merges the potential interior cells from all objects and fills them with '1' on the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    interior = lambda c, o: all(n in toindices(o) for n in dneighbors(c))
    interior_cells = set()
    for obj in objs:
        for cell in toindices(obj):
            if interior(cell, obj):
                interior_cells.add(cell)
    return fill(I, 1, frozenset(interior_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extracts objects using `objects`.
2. **`interior` Lambda Function:** Defines a lambda function `interior` to check if a cell is interior within an object based on its neighbor belonging.
3. **Iterating and Checking:** Iterates through objects and their cells. For each cell, it uses the `interior` lambda function to determine if it's an interior cell.
4. **Filling Interior Cells:** Identified interior cells are added to a set and finally filled with '1' on the input grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  def is_interior(obj):
    return lambda cell: contained(cell, toindices(obj)) and all(contained(n, toindices(obj)) for n in dneighbors(cell))
  interior_cells = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), is_interior(obj)), objs)
  return fill(I, 1, merge(interior_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extracts objects using `objects`.
2. **`is_interior` Function Factory:** Defines a function factory `is_interior` that generates a function for checking interior cells specific to a particular object. 
3. **Mapping and Filtering:** Uses `mapply` to apply a lambda function to each object. The lambda function uses `sfilter` and the generated `is_interior` function to filter out non-interior cells from the object's indices.
4. **Merging and Filling:** Merges the remaining interior cells from all objects and fills them with '1' on the input grid. 

These five versions offer diverse approaches to identifying and filling interior cells within objects, demonstrating flexibility and creativity in utilizing the provided DSL functions.
