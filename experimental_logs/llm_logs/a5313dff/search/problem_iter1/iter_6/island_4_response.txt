## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid and then drawing vertical lines within those objects, alternating between the object's original color and the color '1'.  The lines are drawn with a spacing of one cell.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The single object is filled with alternating vertical lines of '2' and '1'.
* **Input_1:** Each of the two objects (one horizontal, one vertical) is filled with alternating lines. 
* **Input_2:**  Similar to the previous examples, all objects are filled with alternating vertical lines.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 2):
      I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iterate through columns:** For each object, it iterates through its columns with a step of 2, starting from the leftmost column.
3. **Draw vertical lines:**  In each selected column, it draws a vertical line of color '1' spanning the entire height of the object. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({recolor(1, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}) 
                         for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 2)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify lines:** The code identifies the indices of all vertical lines to be drawn within each object. 
2. **Recolor lines:** It recolors the identified lines to '1'.
3. **Paint on the grid:** It paints all the recoloured lines onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({branch(even(j - leftmost(obj)), 
                             recolor(1, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}), 
                             {(1, (0, 0))})  
                         for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and check parity:** This version iterates through each column of every object and uses the 'even' function to check if the column index relative to the object's leftmost column is even.
2. **Conditional recoloring:** If the index is even, it recolors the entire column to '1'; otherwise, it does nothing (indicated by `{(1, (0, 0))}` which won't affect the grid).
3. **Paint on the grid:** Finally, it paints the recoloured columns onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, 
                  paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
                        merge({recolor(1, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}) 
                               for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 2)})), 
                  1) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a canvas:** It creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
2. **Draw lines on the canvas:** It identifies and draws the desired vertical lines (color '1') on the blank canvas.
3. **Cellwise merging:** It uses the `cellwise` function to merge the original grid with the canvas, using '1' as the fallback color. This effectively keeps the original colors where there are no lines on the canvas and fills in the lines.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  lined_grid = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1):
      if even(j - leftmost(obj)):
        lined_grid = fill(lined_grid, 1, connect((uppermost(obj), j), (lowermost(obj), j)))
  return lined_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and check parity:** This version iterates through each column of every object, starting from the second column (index + 1) and checks for even index relative to the object's leftmost column.
2. **Draw lines:** If the column index is even, it draws a vertical line of color '1' spanning the entire height of the object using the `connect` function. 
3. **Return modified grid:** It returns the modified grid with the drawn lines.


These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
