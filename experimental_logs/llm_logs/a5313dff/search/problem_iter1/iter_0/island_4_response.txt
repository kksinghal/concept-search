## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples revolves around identifying the "interior" of objects formed by the digit '2' on a background of '0'. This "interior" excludes the outer layer of '2's and any '2's directly connected to the outer layer.  Here's a breakdown:

**Example 0:**

- The input has a single '2'-object. 
- The output replaces the inner '2's with '1's, essentially creating a hollow shape.

**Example 1:**

- The input has a more complex '2'-object with branches.
- The output again hollows out the object, replacing only the non-border '2's with '1's.

**Example 2:**

- The input has multiple '2'-objects of varying sizes.
- The output consistently hollows out all '2'-objects while preserving their shape.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions in the provided DSL to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_a65b410d(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Extract all objects (non-background connected components)
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)  # Get indices of object cells
    outer = box(indices)       # Find the outer boundary of the object
    inner = indices - outer     # Get indices inside the object but not on the boundary
    I = fill(I, 1, inner)    # Fill the inner indices with '1'
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** It identifies all connected components of non-background colors in the input grid `I` and stores them in `objs`.
2. **Iterate and Hollow:**  For each object:
    -  It finds the object's outer boundary using `box(indices)`.
    -  It calculates the inner cells by subtracting the boundary (`outer`) from the object's indices (`indices`).
    -  It fills these inner cells with the value '1' using `fill(I, 1, inner)`.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid `I`, now with hollowed objects, is returned as the output `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_a65b410d(I):
  O = I
  indices = ofcolor(I, 2) # Get all indices of '2'
  for index in indices:
    n = neighbors(index)  # Get neighbors of each '2'
    if all(0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]) and (I[i][j] == 2 or I[i][j] == 0) for i, j in n):
      O = fill(O, 1, {index}) # If all neighbors are '2' or '0', fill with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through '2's:** The program iterates over each cell in the grid. If the cell's value is '2', it proceeds.
2. **Check Neighbors:**  For each '2', it examines its 8 neighbors (including diagonals).
3. **Fill if Interior:** If all neighboring cells are either '2' or '0', it marks the current cell for filling with '1'.
4. **Fill and Return:** After processing all cells, the program fills the marked cells with '1' and returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:** 

```python
def solve_a65b410d(I):
    two_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
    boundary = mapply(neighbors, two_indices) - two_indices
    inner = two_indices - boundary
    return fill(I, 1, inner)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' Indices:** `ofcolor(I, 2)` identifies all indices in the grid `I` containing the value '2'.
2. **Determine Boundary:** It finds all neighbors of '2' cells and removes the '2' indices themselves. This leaves us with the boundary of '2'-objects.
3. **Extract Inner Cells:** It subtracts the boundary from the set of all '2' indices, resulting in the set of inner cells.
4. **Fill and Return:** Finally, it uses `fill` to replace the values at the inner cell indices with '1' in the input grid `I` and returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_a65b410d(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)  # Get all objects, including background
  bg = mostcommon(I)         # Identify the background color
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != bg:      # Ignore the background object
      indices = toindices(obj)
      outer = box(indices)    
      inner = indices - outer  
      I = fill(I, 1, inner) 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract All Objects:** It gets all connected components, including the background object.
2. **Identify Background:** It determines the background color using `mostcommon(I)`.
3. **Iterate and Hollow:** It iterates through each object. If the object is not the background, it calculates the inner cells (as in previous versions) and fills them with '1'.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Finally, it returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_a65b410d(I):
    def is_inner(i, j):
        return 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]) and I[i][j] == 2 and any(0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) and I[i + di][j + dj] != 2 for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)])
    
    return tuple(
        tuple(1 if is_inner(i, j) else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) 
        for i in range(len(I))
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `is_inner` Function:** This function checks if a given cell at `(i, j)` is an inner cell of a '2'-object. A cell is considered inner if:
   - It's within the grid boundaries.
   - Its value is '2'.
   - At least one of its directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) is not '2'.

2. **Construct Output Grid:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. For every cell, it calls the `is_inner` function. 
   - If `is_inner` returns `True` (meaning the cell is an inner '2' cell), the corresponding output cell is set to '1'. 
   - Otherwise, the output cell retains the original value from the input grid.

3. **Return Output:** The resulting grid is returned as the final output.
