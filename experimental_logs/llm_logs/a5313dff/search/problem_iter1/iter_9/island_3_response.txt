## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "interior" of objects within the grid and replacing those cells with the value '1'. The edges of the objects retain their original values.

**Logic Breakdown:**

1. **Downscaling:** The input grid is downscaled by a factor of 2. This effectively merges adjacent cells of the same value, simplifying the object representation.
2. **Upscaling:** The downscaled grid is upscaled back to the original size. During upscaling, newly created cells are filled with the dominant color (background) of the original grid.
3. **Conditional Replacement:** The original grid and the upscaled grid are compared cell by cell. If the values at corresponding locations match, indicating an "interior" cell, the cell in the original grid is replaced with '1'. Otherwise, the original cell value is retained.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    downscaled = downscale(I, 2)
    upscaled = upscale(downscaled, 2)
    O = cellwise(I, upscaled, 1)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly implements the identified transformation logic using DSL functions. 

- `downscale(I, 2)` reduces the grid size, merging cells.
- `upscale(downscaled, 2)` brings it back to the original size, filling new cells with the background color.
- `cellwise(I, upscaled, 1)` compares original and upscaled grids, replacing matching cells with '1'.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  
  for obj in objects(I, univalued = False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
        if sum((i + di, j + dj) in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]) == 4:
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies objects, iterates over each object's cells, and checks if a cell has all four direct neighbors within the same object. If it does, it's considered an interior cell and replaced with '1'.

- `objects(I, univalued = False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)` extracts all objects from the grid.
-  For each `obj` in `objects`:
    - If the object size is greater than 1 (meaning it's not a single cell):
       - For each cell `(v, (i, j))` in the object:
         - Check if all four direct neighbors are part of the same object using `sum((i + di, j + dj) in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]) == 4`
         - If true, fill the cell with '1' using `fill(O, 1, {(i,j)})`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)))  
    for obj in sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1):
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, inbox(toindices(obj))))
      O = paint(O, toobject(toindices(obj), I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on identifying the "inbox" of each object, which represents the interior. It paints the inbox with '1' and then overlays the original object to restore the edges.

- `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)` extracts all objects from the grid.
- `O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)))` initializes the output grid with the background color and paints single-cell objects directly.
- For each `obj` in `objects` with `size(obj) > 1`:
    - `O = paint(O, recolor(1, inbox(toindices(obj))))` paints the object's inbox with '1'.
    - `O = paint(O, toobject(toindices(obj), I))` overlays the original object onto the output grid, restoring the edges.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      for x,y in toindices(obj):
        if all(index(I, (x+i, y+j)) == color(obj) for i in [-1,0,1] for j in [-1,0,1] if (i,j)!=(0,0) and 0<=x+i<len(I) and 0<=y+j<len(I[0])):
          O = fill(O, 1, {(x,y)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly iterates through every cell of each object and checks its 8 neighbors. If all neighbors are part of the same object, the cell is considered internal and replaced with '1'.

- For each object in the input grid:
    - If the object has more than one cell:
       - For every cell (x, y) in the object:
         - Check if all 8 neighbors have the same color as the current object, ensuring to stay within the grid boundaries.
         - If true, replace the cell at (x,y) in the output grid with '1'.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    downscaled = downscale(I, 2)
    upscaled = upscale(downscaled, 2)
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
      for j in range(len(I[0])):
        if I[i][j] == upscaled[i][j]:
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines the downscaling/upscaling approach with direct grid traversal and comparison for replacement. It's similar to Version 1 but replaces the `cellwise` function with explicit loops for cell comparison.

- `downscaled = downscale(I, 2)`: Downscales the input grid by a factor of 2.
- `upscaled = upscale(downscaled, 2)`: Upscales the downscaled grid back to the original size, filling new cells with the background color.
- `O = I`: Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
- It then iterates through each cell of the original and upscaled grids:
   - If the values at corresponding locations match:
     -  Replace the cell in the output grid with '1' using `O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j)})`.
