## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the interior spaces of all non-background objects within the grid and filling them with the value '1'. 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 
- There's one object formed by the digit '2'. 
- The interior space of this object is filled with '1'.

**Input_1:** 
- Similar to Input_0, the interior of the object formed by '2' is filled with '1'.

**Input_2:**
- Again, the transformation consistently fills the interior spaces of all non-background objects (formed by '2') with '1'. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  interiors = mapply(lambda obj: difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)), objs)
  return fill(I, 1, merge(interiors))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We first use `objects` to identify all non-background objects in the grid.
2. **Extract Interiors:** For each object, we calculate its `backdrop` (bounding box including the object) and subtract its `box` (outline) to get the interior indices.
3. **Fill Interiors:** Finally, we `merge` all interior indices and `fill` them with the value '1' in the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj))), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to Version 1, we identify all non-background objects.
2. **Recolor Interiors:**  We `recolor` the interior indices of each object (calculated as in Version 1) to '1'.
3. **Paint Interiors:** We `merge` the recolored objects and `paint` them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    I = fill(I, 1, difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Fill:** This version directly iterates through each non-background object. For each object, it calculates the interior indices and fills them with '1' in the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(1, idx) for idx in difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj))}, objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Process:** This version combines object identification and interior processing. It identifies non-background objects and for each object, it creates a new object containing only the interior indices with the value '1'.
2. **Paint:**  Finally, it merges these new objects and paints them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  filled = fill(I, 1, asindices(I))
  objs = objects(filled, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      I = underfill(I, 1, difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Fill and Identify:** First, it fills the entire grid with '1' and identifies objects in this new grid.
2. **Filter and Underfill:** It then iterates through these objects and only processes the ones originally filled with '1'. It uses `underfill` to fill the interiors of these objects in the original grid.


Each version utilizes a slightly different approach to achieve the same transformation.
