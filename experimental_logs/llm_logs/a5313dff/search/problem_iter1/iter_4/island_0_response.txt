## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the 'interior' cells of objects formed by the digit '2' and changing their values to '1', while leaving the 'border' cells as '2'. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 
- The central 'hole' of the '2' object is filled with '1's.
- The outer boundary of the object retains the value '2'.

**Input_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, the internal cells of each connected '2' component are filled with '1's.
- The boundary cells of each component keep the value '2'.

**Input_2:**
- This input showcases the transformation applied to multiple '2' objects. 
- Each object's interior is filled with '1's, while the boundary remains '2'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the provided DSL, along with explanations for each version:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, box(toindices(obj))))
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(1, toindices(obj))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Create an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through each object in the input grid.
3. **Color Check:** If the object's color is '2', proceed.
4. **Boundary Painting:** Paint the boundary of the object on the canvas with the color '2'.
5. **Interior Filling:** Fill the interior of the object on the canvas with the color '1' using `underpaint` to avoid overwriting the boundary.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      O = fill(O, 1, inbox(toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:**  Modify the input grid (`I`) directly.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through each object.
3. **Color Check:** If the object's color is '2', proceed.
4. **Interior Filling:** Fill the 'inbox' (area enclosed by the outer boundary) of the object with the color '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
      if index(I, (i,j)) == 2 and any(index(I, (ni,nj)) != 2 for ni, nj in neighbors((i,j))):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** Modify the input grid (`I`) directly.
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterate through each cell, excluding the border.
3. **Condition Check:** If a cell's value is '2' and it has at least one neighbor that is not '2', proceed. 
4. **Interior Filling:** Fill the cell with the color '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
        if color(obj) == 2:
            O = paint(O, recolor(1, toindices(obj)))
            O = paint(O, recolor(2, delta(toindices(obj))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:**  Modify the input grid (`I`) directly.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through each object.
3. **Color Check:** If the object's color is '2', proceed.
4. **Interior Painting:** Paint the entire object with '1'.
5. **Boundary Restoration:** Paint the 'delta' (boundary cells) of the object back to '2'. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      O = paint(O, obj)
      O = underfill(O, 1,  toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Create a canvas (`O`) filled with the background color and the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through each object.
3. **Color Check:** If the object's color is '2', proceed.
4. **Object Painting:** Paint the object onto the canvas.
5. **Interior Filling:**  Fill the object's interior with '1' using `underfill` to avoid changing the color of the object's boundary.
