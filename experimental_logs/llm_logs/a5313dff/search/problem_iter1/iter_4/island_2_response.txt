## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "interior" cells of objects within the grid and changing their color to 1. The "interior" cells are defined as cells that are part of an object (any non-background color) and are completely surrounded by other object cells. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The central 2x2 area within the '2' object is filled with '1' as these cells are surrounded by other '2' cells.
* **Input_1:**  The interior cells of both the '2' objects are filled with '1'.
* **Input_2:** Similar to the previous examples, only the interior cells of the '2' objects are changed to '1'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated`  function in the given DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  interior = frozenset({cell for obj in objs for cell in toindices(obj) if dneighbors(cell).issubset(toindices(merge(objs)))})
  return fill(I, 1, interior)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`.
2. **Find Interior Cells:**  Iterate through each cell of each object and check if all its direct neighbors (`dneighbors`) are also part of any object in the grid. If yes, add the cell to the `interior` set.
3. **Fill Interior:** Fill the `interior` cells with color '1' using the `fill` function on the input grid `I`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  all_cells = asindices(I)
  border_cells = mapply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), mfilter(lambda c: intersection(dneighbors(c), toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))), objs)
  interior_cells = difference(all_cells, border_cells)
  return fill(I, 1, interior_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Cells:** Find all objects and the indices of all cells in the grid.
2. **Find Border Cells:** For each object, find its border cells by subtracting the cells that have all their direct neighbors within the same object. 
3. **Find Interior Cells:**  Subtract the border cells from all cells to get the interior cells.
4. **Fill Interior:** Fill the `interior_cells` with '1'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            if all((i+di, j+dj) in toindices(merge(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))) for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]):
                I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:**  This version iterates directly through each cell of each object.
2. **Check Neighbors:** For every cell, it checks if all its four direct neighbors are part of any object in the grid. 
3. **Fill if Interior:** If a cell's neighbors satisfy the condition, fill that cell with '1'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    return fill(I, 1, difference(asindices(I), mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid.
2. **Find Border Cells:** Utilize the `delta` function to directly find the border cells of each object.
3. **Find Interior Cells:** Subtract the border cells from all cells in the grid to get the interior cells.
4. **Fill Interior:** Fill the interior cells with color '1'.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    border_cells = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        for cell in toindices(obj):
            for neighbor in dneighbors(cell):
                if neighbor not in toindices(merge(objs)):
                    border_cells = border_cells | {cell}
                    break
    return fill(I, 1, difference(asindices(I), border_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid.
2. **Find Border Cells:** Iteratively check if any direct neighbor of a cell within an object is not part of any object. If so, mark the cell as a border cell.
3. **Find Interior Cells:** Subtract the border cells from all cells in the grid to obtain the interior cells.
4. **Fill Interior:** Fill the interior cells with '1'.


These are five distinct programs that achieve the desired transformation. Each program employs a slightly different approach to identifying and filling the interior cells of objects in the input grid, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL.
