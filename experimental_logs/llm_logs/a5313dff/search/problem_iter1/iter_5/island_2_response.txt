## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying all objects on the grid (excluding the background color, 0) and filling their interior with the value 1. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The single object formed by the digit '2' has its internal 0s replaced with 1s.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* Both the objects (one vertical and one horizontal) formed by the digit '2' have their internal 0s replaced with 1s.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
*  All objects formed by the digit '2' (regardless of their shape or orientation) have their internal 0s replaced with 1s.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  filled_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, toindices(obj)), objs)
  O = I
  for obj in filled_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(...)` identifies all objects on the grid.
2. **Fill Objects:** `filled_objs = mapply(...)` iterates through each object and uses `recolor` to fill its indices with the value 1.
3. **Paint Objects:** The code iterates through `filled_objs` and paints them onto a copy of the input grid (`O`) using the `paint` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  interior_cells =  mapply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), box(obj)), objs)
  return fill(I, 1, merge(interior_cells))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, `objs` stores all objects.
2. **Find Interior Cells:**  `interior_cells = mapply(...)` calculates the interior cells of each object by finding the difference between all object indices and the indices forming its outline (`box`).
3. **Fill Interior:** `fill(I, 1, merge(interior_cells))` fills the identified interior cells with value 1 on the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  all_cells = asindices(I)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  border_cells = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda c: size(intersection(dneighbors(c), toindices(obj))) < 4), objs)
  interior_cells = difference(all_cells, merge(border_cells))
  return fill(I, 1, interior_cells)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Get All Cells:**  `all_cells` stores indices of all cells in the grid.
2. **Identify Objects and Border Cells:** `objs` stores all objects and `border_cells` identifies border cells by checking if a cell has less than 4 direct neighbors within the same object.
3. **Calculate Interior:** `interior_cells` are calculated by removing border cells from all cells.
4. **Fill Interior:** `fill(...)` fills the interior cells with 1.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(1, height(I)-1):
        for j in range(1, width(I)-1):
            if index(I,(i,j)) != 0 and any(index(I,(i+di,j+dj)) == 0 for di,dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
                O = paint(O, {(1,(i,j))})
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Inner Cells:**  Iterates through each cell of the grid, excluding the border cells.
2. **Check for Non-Background and Neighboring Background:** For each cell, checks if it is not background (value not 0) and has at least one background cell as a direct neighbor. 
3. **Fill if Condition Met:** If both conditions are met, the cell is considered an interior cell and is filled with the value 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_interior(cell, obj_indices):
    return contained(cell, obj_indices) and all(contained(n, obj_indices) for n in dneighbors(cell))
  
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  interior_cells = mfilter(lambda cell: any(is_interior(cell, toindices(obj)) for obj in objs), asindices(I))
  return fill(I, 1, interior_cells) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `is_interior` Function:** This function checks if a given cell is an interior cell within a set of object indices. A cell is considered interior if it belongs to the object and all its direct neighbors also belong to the same object.
2. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(...)` identifies all objects in the grid.
3. **Find Interior Cells:** `interior_cells` uses `mfilter` to find all cells in the grid (`asindices(I)`) that satisfy the `is_interior` condition for any of the identified objects.
4. **Fill Interior Cells:** `fill(I, 1, interior_cells)` fills the identified interior cells with the value 1. 

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation. They leverage different combinations of DSL functions and demonstrate the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
