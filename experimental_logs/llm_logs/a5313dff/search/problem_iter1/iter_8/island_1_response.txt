## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid (excluding the background color, which is most common) and then filling the inner area of these objects with the value '1'. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The object formed by '2's has its inner area (the single '0' surrounded by '2's) replaced with '1'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The large object formed by '2's has its inner area filled with '1's, leaving a diagonal line of '2's intact.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* All three objects formed by '2's (two identical large ones and a small one) have their inner areas filled with '1's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_inside(obj):
    return recolor(1, difference(backdrop(toindices(obj)), combine(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj)))))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(fill_inside, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`**:  Identifies objects in the grid 'I'. Parameters signify: univalued objects, no diagonal connections, and excluding the background.
2. **`apply(fill_inside, ...)`**: Applies the `fill_inside` function to each identified object.
3. **`fill_inside(obj)`**: 
   - **`toindices(obj)`**:  Extracts the indices of cells belonging to the object.
   - **`backdrop(...)`**:  Gets all indices within the bounding box of the object.
   - **`box(...)`**: Gets the indices forming the outline of the object.
   - **`difference(...)`**: Subtracts the object's indices and its outline from the backdrop, leaving only the inner area.
   - **`recolor(1, ...)`**:  Creates a new object with the inner area indices, all colored with '1'.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Combines the recolored objects into a single set of cells.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Applies the changes to the original grid 'I' by painting the merged inner area with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def inner_area(obj):
        return difference(backdrop(toindices(obj)), combine(box(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
    return fill(I, 1, merge(mapply(inner_area, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but uses `fill` instead of `paint` and `recolor`:

1. **`objects(...)`**:  Identifies objects as in Version 1.
2. **`mapply(inner_area, ...)`**:  Applies the `inner_area` function to each object and merges the results.
3. **`inner_area(obj)`**: Calculates the inner area indices as in `fill_inside` of Version 1.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Combines all inner area indices into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, 1, ...)`**: Directly fills the original grid 'I' with '1' at the specified inner area indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def fill_area(obj):
        return {(1, idx) for idx in difference(backdrop(toindices(obj)), combine(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj))))}
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: fill_area(obj), objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a set comprehension within `fill_area` for a more compact way to recolor the inner area:

1. **`objects(...)`**:  Identifies objects.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: fill_area(obj), ...)`**: Applies `fill_area` to each object.
3. **`fill_area(obj)`**: 
   - Calculates inner area indices as in previous versions.
   - Uses a set comprehension `{(1, idx) for idx in ...}` to directly create a set of (value, index) pairs representing the inner area filled with '1'.
4. **`merge(...)`**:  Combines the filled areas.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the combined areas onto the grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_inner(obj):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    return {(1, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(indices) + 1, lowermost(indices)) for j in range(leftmost(indices) + 1, rightmost(indices)) if (i, j) not in indices}
  return paint(I, merge(apply(fill_inner, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the bounding box of each object to find and fill the inner area:

1. **`objects(...)`**:  Identifies objects.
2. **`apply(fill_inner, ...)`**: Applies `fill_inner` to each object.
3. **`fill_inner(obj)`**:
   - **`indices = toindices(obj)`**:  Gets object indices.
   - Uses a set comprehension with nested loops to iterate through the rows and columns within the object's bounding box.
   - **`if (i, j) not in indices`**:  Checks if the current index is part of the object itself; if not, it's part of the inner area and is included in the filled set with value '1'.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Combines filled areas.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the result onto the grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def inner_cells(obj):
    return difference(
      {(i,j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)},
      toindices(obj)
    )
  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(lambda obj: inner_cells(obj), objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version generates all indices within the bounding box and then subtracts the object's indices to get the inner area:

1. **`objects(...)`**:  Identifies objects.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: inner_cells(obj), ...)`**: Applies `inner_cells` to each object.
3. **`inner_cells(obj)`**: 
   - Uses set comprehension to generate all indices within the object's bounding box.
   - **`difference(...)`**:  Subtracts the object's indices from the generated bounding box indices, leaving only the inner area.
4. **`merge(...)`**:  Combines inner areas.
5. **`fill(I, 1, ...)`**: Fills the combined inner areas on the original grid with '1'.
