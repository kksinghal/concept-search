## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the interior cells of each object (cells not touching the object's outer boundary) and changing their color to 1. 

**Let's analyze each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The single object's interior forms a rectangle. The transformation fills this rectangle with '1'.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the interior of the larger object is filled with '1'.
* **Input_2:** The transformation consistently fills the interior of every object with '1' across the grid.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  interiors = mapply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj))), objs)
  O = I
  for interior in interiors:
    O = fill(O, 1, interior)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Find Interiors:** `interiors = mapply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj))), objs)` calculates the interior cells of each object by subtracting its boundary (`box`) from its total cells (`toindices`).
3. **Fill Interiors:** The code iterates through each `interior` in `interiors` and uses `fill(O, 1, interior)` to replace the color of interior cells in a copy of the input grid (`O`) with '1'. 
4. **Return Output:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned as the output.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    interior = difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj)))
    O = underfill(O, 1, interior)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** This version iterates directly through each object found using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Calculate and Fill Interior:** For each `obj`, it calculates the `interior` and uses `underfill(O, 1, interior)` to fill only those interior cells that were originally the background color in `O`. 
3. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(1, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    O = paint(O, recolor(0, box(toindices(obj))))
    O = underpaint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:**  A canvas `O` is created, filled entirely with '1' and having the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Draw Boundaries:** The code iterates through objects in `I`, recolors their boundaries (`box`) to '0' on the canvas `O` using `paint`.
3. **Restore Objects:**  It then uses `underpaint` to restore the original object onto the canvas, ensuring only background cells are overwritten.
4. **Return Output:** The canvas `O`, now representing the transformed grid, is returned.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if all((i+di, j+dj) in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies objects in the grid `I` using the `objects` function.
2. **Iterate and Check:** The code iterates over each cell within each object. For every cell, it checks if all its directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) are also part of the same object.
3. **Fill Interior:** If all adjacent neighbors belong to the same object, the cell is considered an interior cell and its color is changed to '1' using the `fill` function.
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, width(I)-1):
      if index(I, (i,j)) != mostcolor(I) and {(i-1,j),(i+1,j),(i,j-1),(i,j+1)}.issubset(toindices(objects(crop(I, (i-1,j-1), (3,3)), True, False, True)[0])):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** It iterates through each cell of the grid, excluding the border cells.
2. **Extract 3x3 Subgrid:** For each cell, it extracts a 3x3 subgrid centered around the cell.
3. **Check for Interior:** It checks if the current cell is not the background color and if all its direct neighbors in the 3x3 subgrid are part of the same object.
4. **Fill Interior:** If the conditions hold, the cell is identified as an interior cell and its value is changed to '1' using the `fill` function.
5. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

These five versions showcase different strategies and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation. Each version offers a unique approach to identifying and modifying the interior cells of objects in the input grid.
