## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the 'interior' of objects formed by connected pixels of the same color (excluding the background color 0). The interior is then filled with the value 1. 

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 2 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 
```

In this example, the '2' shape in the input has its interior filled with '1' in the output.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Extract all objects (excluding background)
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    inner = indices - box(indices)  # Find the inner indices by subtracting the box outline
    I = fill(I, 1, inner)  # Fill the inner indices with 1
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version directly identifies the interior indices by subtracting the object's bounding box from the set of all object indices. Then, it fills these interior indices with 1.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != 0 and I[i-1][j] == I[i][j] and I[i+1][j] == I[i][j] and I[i][j-1] == I[i][j] and I[i][j+1] == I[i][j]:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)}) # Fill with 1 if surrounded by the same color
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid (excluding the border). If a cell is non-background and surrounded by cells of the same color, it is considered an interior cell and filled with 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  inner_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if all((i + di, j + dj) in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
        inner_indices.add((i, j))
  return fill(I, 1, frozenset(inner_indices))
```

**Explanation:** This version identifies interior cells by checking if all four direct neighbors of a cell within an object are also part of the same object. If so, the cell is added to the set of inner indices, which are then filled with 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, toindices(obj) - box(obj)))
  return cellwise(I, O, 0) 
```

**Explanation:** This version first creates an empty canvas. It then iterates through each object, calculates the interior indices by subtracting the bounding box, and paints these indices with 1 onto the canvas. Finally, it merges the original grid with the canvas, prioritizing the original colors.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_inner(obj, i, j):
    return all((i + di, j + dj) in toindices(obj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if (di, dj) != (0, 0))
  
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  inner_cells = {(v, (i, j)) for obj in objs for v, (i, j) in obj if is_inner(obj, i, j)}
  return paint(I, inner_cells)
```

**Explanation:** This version defines a helper function 'is_inner' to check if a cell is an interior cell by verifying if all its eight neighbors are part of the same object. It then extracts all interior cells from all objects and paints them with their respective colors onto the original grid.
