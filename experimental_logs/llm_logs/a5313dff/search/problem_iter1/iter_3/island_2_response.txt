## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies the outlines or borders of all objects (excluding the background) in the input grid and fills those border cells with the value '1'. 

**Input 0:**

- The '2' object's outer border cells are replaced with '1'.

**Input 1:**

- The '2' object's outer border cells are replaced with '1'.

**Input 2:**

-  The '2' object's outer border cells are replaced with '1'. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) 
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  border_cells = mpapply(lambda o: intersection(dneighbors(o), asindices(I)), toindices(merge(objs)), toindices(merge(objs)))
  return fill(I, 1, border_cells) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all objects in the grid except the background.
2. **Find Border Cells:** 
   - `toindices(merge(objs))`: Gets all indices occupied by the objects.
   - `mpapply(lambda o: intersection(dneighbors(o), asindices(I)), toindices(merge(objs)), toindices(merge(objs)))`:  For each object cell, it finds its direct neighbors that are within the grid's boundaries and part of another object. This identifies the border cells. 
3. **Fill Border Cells:** `fill(I, 1, border_cells)` fills the identified border cells with '1'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  border_cells = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      for n in dneighbors(cell):
        if 0 <= n[0] < len(I) and 0 <= n[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, n) != bg and n not in toindices(obj):
          border_cells = insert(cell, border_cells)
  return fill(I, 1, border_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Border Cells:** 
   - Iterates through each object and its cells.
   - For each cell, it checks its direct neighbors:
     - If the neighbor is within the grid, not background color, and belongs to a different object, the current cell is marked as a border cell.
3. **Fill Border Cells:** Same as Version 1.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    border = toindices(merge(objs))
    interior = mpapply(lambda c: intersection(dneighbors(c), toindices(merge(objs))), toindices(merge(objs)), toindices(merge(objs)))
    border_cells = difference(border, interior)
    return fill(I, 1, border_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Border Cells:**
   - `border = toindices(merge(objs))`: Gets all indices occupied by the objects.
   - `interior =  mpapply(lambda c: intersection(dneighbors(c), toindices(merge(objs))), toindices(merge(objs)), toindices(merge(objs)))`: Finds all cells that are completely surrounded by other object cells (i.e., not on the border).
   - `border_cells = difference(border, interior)`: Calculates the border cells by finding the difference between all object cells and the interior cells. 
3. **Fill Border Cells:** Same as Version 1.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled_grid = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if i > 0 and j > 0 and i < len(I) - 1 and j < len(I[0]) - 1:  
        if I[i][j] == mostcolor(I) and (I[i-1][j] != mostcolor(I) or I[i+1][j] != mostcolor(I) or I[i][j-1] != mostcolor(I) or I[i][j+1] != mostcolor(I)):
          filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** Directly iterates through each cell in the grid, excluding the outermost border. 
2. **Identify and Fill Border:** If a cell is background and has a non-background neighbor, it's filled with '1'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grids = (shift(asobject(I), UP), shift(asobject(I), DOWN), shift(asobject(I), LEFT), shift(asobject(I), RIGHT))
  border_cells = frozenset()
  for grid in shifted_grids:
    border_cells = border_cells | frozenset((i, j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if (I[i][j] == mostcolor(I)) and ((i, j) in toindices(grid))) 
  return fill(I, 1, border_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Compare:** Creates shifted versions of the grid (up, down, left, right) and compares each shifted grid to the original.
2. **Identify Border:** If a cell is background in the original grid but occupied by an object in any of the shifted grids, it's a border cell.
3. **Fill Border Cells:** Same as Version 1. 

This provides five distinct solutions to the problem, all leveraging different aspects of the provided DSL to achieve the same outcome.
