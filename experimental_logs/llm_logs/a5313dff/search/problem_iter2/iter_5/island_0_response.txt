## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a simple diagonal object and expands it, embedding a transformed version of itself within. The specifics of the transformation depend on the shape of the initial object:

**Input_0:** 
- **Transformation:**  The object is expanded horizontally, becoming twice as wide. A horizontally mirrored and color-shifted version of the original object (using color '1') is placed in the center of the expanded object.
- **Similarity Score:** 0.23570226039551587

**Input_1:**
- **Transformation:** The object is expanded vertically, becoming twice as tall. A vertically mirrored and color-shifted version of the original object is placed in the center of the expanded object.
- **Similarity Score:** 0.2886751345948129

**Input_2:**
- **Transformation:** The object is expanded both horizontally and vertically, becoming twice as large in both dimensions. A diagonally mirrored and color-shifted version of the original object is placed in the center of the expanded object. Additionally, the expanded object is surrounded by a border of color '2'.
- **Similarity Score:** 0.41421356237309515


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_color = leastcolor(I)
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  obj = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, obj_color), I))
  h, w = shape(obj)
  O = canvas(bg_color, (h * 2 + 2, w * 2 + 2))
  
  O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj, 2), (1, 1)))
  
  if h > w:
    inner_obj = recolor(1, shift(crop(O, (3, 2), (h*2-2, w*2-2)), (-2, 0)))
  elif w > h:
    inner_obj = recolor(1, shift(crop(O, (2, 3), (h*2-2, w*2-2)), (0, -2)))
  else:
    inner_obj = recolor(1, shift(crop(O, (3, 3), (h*2-4, w*2-4)), (-2, -2)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, outbox(shift(obj, (1, 1)))))
    
  O = paint(O, inner_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object and Background:** Determine the object color and background color.
2. **Normalize Object:** Normalize the object to have its upper-left corner at the origin.
3. **Create Canvas:** Create a canvas with dimensions twice the object size plus a two-cell border.
4. **Upscale and Position:** Upscale the object by a factor of 2 and position it on the canvas with a one-cell offset from the top and left.
5. **Conditional Inner Object:**
    - If the object is taller than it is wide (vertical expansion), create an inner object that is a horizontally mirrored and color-shifted version of the original object.
    - If the object is wider than it is tall (horizontal expansion), create an inner object that is a vertically mirrored and color-shifted version of the original object.
    - If the object is a square (cross expansion), create an inner object that is a diagonally mirrored and color-shifted version of the original object. Additionally, paint the outbox of the expanded object with color '2'.
6. **Paint Inner Object:** Paint the inner object onto the canvas.
7. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid.

This program analyzes the shape of the object and applies the appropriate transformation based on whether it is taller, wider, or a square. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_color = leastcolor(I)
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  obj = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, obj_color), I))
  h, w = shape(obj)
  O = canvas(bg_color, (max(h, w) * 2 + 2, max(h, w) * 2 + 2))
  center_offset = (O[0]//2 - h//2 - h % 2, len(O[0])//2 - w//2 - w % 2)

  O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj, 2), center_offset))
  inner_obj = recolor(1, shift(obj, (center_offset[0] * 2, center_offset[1] * 2)))

  if h == w:
    inner_obj = dmirror(inner_obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, outbox(shift(obj, center_offset))))
  elif h > w:
    inner_obj = vmirror(inner_obj)
  else:
    inner_obj = hmirror(inner_obj)

  O = paint(O, inner_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Object and Background:** Similar to version 1.
2.  **Normalize Object:** Similar to version 1.
3.  **Create Canvas:**  Creates a square canvas based on the larger dimension of the object.
4.  **Calculate Center Offset:** Determines the offset required to center the object on the canvas.
5.  **Upscale and Position:**  Upscales and centers the object on the canvas.
6.  **Create Inner Object:** Creates a color-shifted copy of the original object and positions it at the center of the expanded object.
7.  **Conditional Mirroring and Border:**
    - If the object is a square, diagonally mirror the inner object and add a border.
    - If the object is taller than wide, vertically mirror the inner object.
    - If the object is wider than tall, horizontally mirror the inner object.
8.  **Paint Inner Object:** Similar to version 1.
9.  **Return Output:** Similar to version 1.

Version 2 simplifies the logic by creating the inner object first and then applying mirroring based on the object's shape. It also uses a more generalized approach for canvas sizing and centering.
