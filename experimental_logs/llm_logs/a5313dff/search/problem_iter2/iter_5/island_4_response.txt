## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-color object on a background and applies a specific shape and scaling based on the relative positions of certain cells within the object. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

* **Logic:** The input object (a diagonal line) is transformed into a diamond shape. The diamond is scaled up, and a smaller diamond of a different color is placed in the center. 
* **Key Feature:** The transformation is triggered by the presence of cells at relative positions (0,1) and (1,0) within the object.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

* **Logic:** The input object (a diagonal line) is transformed into a horizontal rectangle. The rectangle is placed vertically, and a horizontal line of a different color is drawn across its center.
* **Key Feature:** This transformation is triggered by the presence of cells at relative positions (1,0) and (1,2) within the object.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

* **Logic:** The input object (a diagonal line) is transformed into a larger diamond shape. This diamond is significantly scaled up, and a pattern of smaller diamonds of a different color is drawn within it.
* **Key Feature:** This transformation is triggered by the presence of cells at relative positions (1,2) and (2,1) within the object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, F, F, T))
  color = color(obj)
  indices = frozenset(position(initset(c), initset(d)) for c in obj for d in obj if c != d)
  
  if (0, 1) in indices and (1, 0) in indices:
    shape = asobject(((0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0)))
    upscale_factor = (2, 2)
    shift_offset = (1, 1)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (8, 8)), recolor(color, shift(upscale(shape, upscale_factor), shift_offset)))
    O = fill(O, 1, {(3, 3)})
    
  elif (1, 0) in indices and (1, 2) in indices:
    shape = {(i, 3) for i in range(1, 7)}
    upscale_factor = (1, 1)
    shift_offset = (0, 3)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (8, 8)), recolor(color, shift(upscale(shape, upscale_factor), shift_offset)))
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, 4) for i in range(3, 7)})

  elif (1, 2) in indices and (2, 1) in indices:
    shape = asobject(((0, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)))
    upscale_factor = (2, 2)
    shift_offset = (-1, -1)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (12, 12)), recolor(color, shift(upscale(shape, upscale_factor), shift_offset)))
    for i in range(2, 8, 2):
      O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j) for j in range(i - 1, 11 - (i - 1))})
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (1, 1))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Color Extraction:** Extracts the object and its color.
2. **Relative Position Calculation:** Computes the relative positions of each cell pair within the object.
3. **Transformation Selection:** Uses conditional statements to apply the appropriate transformation based on the presence of specific relative positions.
4. **Shape Creation and Transformation:** Creates the target shape, scales it, shifts it, and paints it on a blank canvas.
5. **Additional Features:** Adds the smaller shapes with a different color based on the chosen transformation.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, F, F, T))
  color = color(obj)
  ul = ulcorner(obj)

  if (ul[0] + 1, ul[1]) in toindices(obj) and (ul[0], ul[1] + 1) in toindices(obj):
    shape = asobject(((0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0)))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (8, 8)), recolor(color, shift(upscale(shape, (2, 2)), (1, 1))))
    O = fill(O, 1, {(3, 3)})

  elif (ul[0] + 1, ul[1]) in toindices(obj) and (ul[0] + 1, ul[1] + 2) in toindices(obj):
    shape = {(i, 3) for i in range(1, 7)}
    O = paint(canvas(0, (8, 8)), recolor(color, shift(upscale(shape, (1, 1)), (0, 3))))
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, 4) for i in range(3, 7)})

  elif (ul[0] + 1, ul[1] + 2) in toindices(obj) and (ul[0] + 2, ul[1] + 1) in toindices(obj):
    shape = asobject(((0, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (12, 12)), recolor(color, shift(upscale(shape, (2, 2)), (-1, -1))))
    for i in range(2, 8, 2):
      O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j) for j in range(i - 1, 11 - (i - 1))})
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (1, 1))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Color Extraction:**  Same as Version 1.
2. **Upper-Left Corner Identification:** Identifies the upper-left corner of the object.
3. **Transformation Selection:**  Uses the upper-left corner as a reference point to check for specific cell positions and apply the corresponding transformation.
4. **Shape Creation and Transformation:** Same as Version 1.
5. **Additional Features:** Same as Version 1.
