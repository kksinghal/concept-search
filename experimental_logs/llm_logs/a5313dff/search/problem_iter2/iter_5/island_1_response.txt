## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Upscale and Recolor:** The input object (formed by digit 5) is upscaled by a factor of 3 and its color is changed to 2.
2. **Center Fill:** A single cell at the center of the upscaled object is filled with the color 1.
3. **Canvas and Positioning:** The upscaled object is placed on an 8x8 canvas with its upper-left corner at (1,1).

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **Upscale and Recolor:** The input object is upscaled by a factor of 3 and recolored to 2.
2. **Rotation and Positioning:** The upscaled object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and placed on an 8x8 canvas. The position is offset so that the original object's top-right corner aligns with the upscaled object's top-left corner.
3. **Center Fill:** The three central cells of the upscaled object are filled with color 1, forming a vertical line.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

1. **Upscale and Recolor:** The input object is upscaled by a factor of 3 and recolored to 2.
2. **Rotation and Positioning:** The upscaled object is rotated 180 degrees and placed on a 12x12 canvas. The position is offset so the original object's bottom-right corner aligns with the upscaled object's top-left corner.
3. **Center Fill:** The nine central cells of the upscaled object are filled with color 1, forming a 3x3 square.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five different program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))
  upscaled_obj = upscale(obj, 3)
  canvas_size = (8, 8) if size(obj) < 5 else (12, 12)
  O = canvas(0, canvas_size)
  offset = (1, 1) if size(obj) == 1 else (0, 3) if size(obj) == 3 else (3, 9)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscaled_obj, offset)))
  fill_size = (1, 1) if size(obj) == 1 else (3, 1) if size(obj) == 3 else (3, 3)
  O = fill(O, 1, shift(crop(backdrop(upscaled_obj), center(upscaled_obj), fill_size), offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version uses conditional statements based on the size of the input object to determine the canvas size, offset, and fill size. It first identifies the object, upscales it, and recolors it to 2. Then, it calculates the appropriate offset for positioning on the canvas based on the input object's size. Finally, it fills the center of the upscaled object with color 1, with the fill size determined by the input object size.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))
  size_factor = size(obj)
  O = canvas(0, astuple(8 if size_factor == 1 else 12, 8 if size_factor == 1 else 12))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(obj, 3), (1 if size_factor == 1 else 0, 3 * (size_factor - 1)))))
  O = fill(O, 1, shift(crop(backdrop(upscale(obj, 3)), center(upscale(obj, 3)), (size_factor, size_factor)), (1 if size_factor == 1 else 0, 3 * (size_factor - 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version calculates the canvas size, offset, and fill size dynamically based on the input object's size. It utilizes the `size` function to determine the appropriate values for positioning and filling. This eliminates the need for conditional statements and makes the code more concise.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  obj = argmin(objects(I, True, True, True), size)
  s = size(obj)
  O = canvas(0, (8 if s == 1 else 12, 8 if s == 1 else 12))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(obj, 3), (1 if s == 1 else s - 1, 3 * (s - 1)))))
  for i in range(s):
    for j in range(s):
      O = fill(O, 1, shift({(s + 1 - i, 2 * s - j)}, (1 if s == 1 else s - 1, 3 * (s - 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version utilizes nested loops to fill the center of the upscaled object with color 1. The loop iterations are determined by the size of the input object. This approach provides a more structured and readable way to fill the center area compared to using `crop` and `backdrop` functions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))
  n = int(len(obj) ** 0.5)
  O = canvas(0, (8 if n == 1 else 12, 8 if n == 1 else 12))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(obj, 3), ((n - 1) * (1 - (n % 2)), 3 * (n - 1)))))
  center_offset = ((n - 1) * (1 - (n % 2)), 3 * (n - 1))
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
      O = fill(O, 1, {(center_offset[0] + n + 1 - i, center_offset[1] + 2 * n - j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version calculates the square root of the object size to determine the dimensions of the central fill area. It then uses modulo operation (`%`) to adjust the offset based on whether the input object is a 1x1 or 3x3 square. This approach provides a more mathematically concise way to handle different input object sizes.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))
  size_code = 1 if size(obj) == 1 else 3
  O = canvas(0, (8 * size_code, 8 * size_code))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(obj, 3), (0, 3 * (size_code - 1)))))
  O = fill(O, 1, shift(crop(backdrop(upscale(obj, 3)), center(upscale(obj, 3)), (size_code, size_code)), (0, 3 * (size_code - 1))))
  return rot90(O) if size_code == 3 else O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version simplifies the canvas size calculation by directly using the `size_code` derived from the input object size. It also handles the rotation for the 3x3 case by applying `rot90` function at the end, streamlining the code and improving readability.


These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. They demonstrate different ways to handle conditional logic, calculate dynamic values, and manipulate objects on the canvas. You can choose the version that best suits your programming style and the specific requirements of your application.
