## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes the input grid and scales the non-zero object by a factor depending on its shape. The scaled object is then placed on a larger canvas and filled with a specific pattern. 

**Input 0:**

* The object (a diagonal line of 5s) is taller than it is wide. 
* It's scaled by a factor of 2.
* The scaled object is placed in the top left corner of an 8x8 canvas.
* The interior of the scaled object is filled with 1s, creating a border of 2s.

**Input 1:**

* The object is taller than it is wide.
* It's scaled by a factor of 2.
* The scaled object is placed one cell in from the top and left edges of an 8x8 canvas.
*  The interior of the scaled object is filled with a pattern of 1s and 2s, resembling the original object's shape.

**Input 2:**

* The object is wider than it is tall.
* It's scaled by a factor of 3.
* The scaled object is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
* Two copies of the rotated and scaled object are placed on a 12x12 canvas, one in the top left and one below, leaving space between them. 
* The interior of each scaled object is filled with 1s, creating a border of 2s.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions, each with explanations:

**Program Version 1 (using `crop`, `shift`, and nested loops):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  factor = 2 if height(obj) > width(obj) else 3
  canvas_size = (8, 8) if factor == 2 else (12, 12)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  scaled_obj = upscale(toindices(obj), factor)
  
  if height(obj) > width(obj):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(TWO, scaled_obj), (1, 1)))
    for i in range(1 + factor, 1 + factor * (height(obj)-1)):
      for j in range(1 + factor, 1 + factor * (width(obj)-1)):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  else:
    rotated_obj = rot90(scaled_obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (9, 0)))
    for i in range(3 + factor, 3 + factor * (width(obj)-1)):
      for j in range(3 + factor, 3 + factor * (height(obj)-1)):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
    if factor == 3:
      for i in range(9 + factor, 9 + factor * (width(obj)-1)):
        for j in range(factor, factor * (height(obj)-1)):
          O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Object Detection and Scaling:** Similar to previous examples, the code first identifies the non-zero object, determines the scaling factor, creates the canvas, and upscales the object.
* **Placement and Filling:** 
    * If the object is taller than wide, it's placed at (1,1) and the interior is filled using nested loops based on the scaling factor.
    * If wider, it's rotated, placed at (3,3) (and potentially (9,0) for factor 3), and the interior is filled similarly using nested loops.

**Program Version 2 (using `difference`, `backdrop`, and `outbox`):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  factor = 2 if height(obj) > width(obj) else 3
  canvas_size = (8, 8) if factor == 2 else (12, 12)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  scaled_obj = upscale(toindices(obj), factor)
  
  if height(obj) > width(obj):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(TWO, scaled_obj), (1, 1)))
    inner_indices = difference(
        shift(backdrop(scaled_obj), (1, 1)),
        shift(outbox(scaled_obj), (1, 1))
    )
    O = fill(O, ONE, inner_indices)
  else:
    rotated_obj = rot90(scaled_obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj), (9, 0))
    O = fill(O, ONE, difference(
        shift(backdrop(rotated_obj), (3, 3)),
        shift(outbox(rotated_obj), (3, 3))
    ))
    if factor == 3:
      O = fill(O, ONE, difference(
        shift(backdrop(rotated_obj), (9, 0)),
        shift(outbox(rotated_obj), (9, 0))
      ))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Object Detection and Scaling:** Same as Version 1.
* **Placement and Filling:**
    * Placement is the same as Version 1.
    * Filling is done by calculating the difference between the object's backdrop and its outbox, effectively targeting the interior. 

**Program Version 3 (using `underfill`):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  factor = 2 if height(obj) > width(obj) else 3
  canvas_size = (8, 8) if factor == 2 else (12, 12)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  scaled_obj = upscale(toindices(obj), factor)
  
  if height(obj) > width(obj):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(TWO, scaled_obj), (1, 1)))
    O = underfill(O, ONE, shift(backdrop(scaled_obj), (1, 1))) 
  else:
    rotated_obj = rot90(scaled_obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (9, 0)))
    O = underfill(O, ONE, shift(backdrop(rotated_obj), (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = underfill(O, ONE, shift(backdrop(rotated_obj), (9, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Object Detection and Scaling:** Same as Version 1.
* **Placement and Filling:**
    * Placement is the same as Version 1.
    * Filling is done using `underfill`, which only fills in areas currently containing the background color (0 in this case).

**Program Version 4 (using conditional `fill` based on color):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  factor = 2 if height(obj) > width(obj) else 3
  canvas_size = (8, 8) if factor == 2 else (12, 12)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  scaled_obj = upscale(toindices(obj), factor)
  
  if height(obj) > width(obj):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(TWO, scaled_obj), (1, 1)))
    for i in range(canvas_size[0]):
      for j in range(canvas_size[1]):
        if O[i][j] == TWO:
          O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  else:
    rotated_obj = rot90(scaled_obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (9, 0)))
    for i in range(canvas_size[0]):
      for j in range(canvas_size[1]):
        if O[i][j] == TWO:
          O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Object Detection and Scaling:** Same as Version 1.
* **Placement and Filling:**
    * Placement is the same as Version 1.
    * Filling is done using nested loops that iterate through the entire canvas and fill a cell with 1 only if it currently contains the color 2.

**Program Version 5 (using `paint` with cropped and recolored objects):**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  factor = 2 if height(obj) > width(obj) else 3
  canvas_size = (8, 8) if factor == 2 else (12, 12)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  scaled_obj = upscale(toindices(obj), factor)
  
  if height(obj) > width(obj):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(TWO, scaled_obj), (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(ONE, crop(scaled_obj, (1, 1), (height(scaled_obj)-2, width(scaled_obj)-2))), (2, 2)))
  else:
    rotated_obj = rot90(scaled_obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (9, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(ONE, trim(crop(O, (4, 4), (shape(rotated_obj)[0]-2, shape(rotated_obj)[1]-2)))), (4, 4)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(ONE, trim(crop(O, (10, 1), (shape(rotated_obj)[0]-2, shape(rotated_obj)[1]-2)))), (10, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Object Detection and Scaling:** Same as Version 1.
* **Placement and Filling:** 
    * Placement is the same as Version 1.
    * Filling is achieved by creating a new object representing the interior, recoloring it to 1, and then "painting" it onto the canvas at the appropriate offset.


These are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version employs different strategies and combinations of DSL functions to highlight the versatility of the language and provide multiple approaches to the problem.
