## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a 3x3 grid with a single-colored object and creates a larger grid where the object is expanded and stylized:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The object (5) is expanded horizontally and vertically, creating a filled rectangle. A smaller, single-colored object (1) is placed in the center, forming a border.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The object (5) is expanded to the right forming a thick line. A smaller object (2) with a single-colored center (1) is positioned to the left, resembling a flag.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The object (5) expands outwards forming a cross shape.  The arms of the cross are thicker and feature a single-colored center (1), while the tips remain thin. 

## Code Generation:

It's difficult to propose five distinct solutions without seeing the original two programs you want to improve upon. However, I can offer a potential solution based on the provided DSL and the observed transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj = first(fgpartition(I))
    color_obj = color(obj)
    color_bg = mostcolor(I)
    h, w = shape(obj)
    canvas_dims = (max(h, w) * 2 + 2, max(h, w) * 2 + 2) 
    O = canvas(color_bg, canvas_dims)
    center_offset = (canvas_dims[0]//2 - h//2 - h%2, canvas_dims[1]//2 - w//2 - w%2)
    
    if h > w:
        # Vertical Expansion (Similar to Input_1)
        O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj, 2), center_offset))
        inner_obj = recolor(1, shift(crop(O, (center_offset[0]+2, center_offset[1]+1), (h*2-4, w*2-2)), (-2, 0)))
        O = paint(O, inner_obj)
    elif w > h:
        # Horizontal Expansion (Similar to Input_0)
        O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj, 2), center_offset))
        inner_obj = recolor(1, shift(crop(O, (center_offset[0]+1, center_offset[1]+2), (h*2-2, w*2-4)), (0, -2)))
        O = paint(O, inner_obj)
    else:
        # Cross Expansion (Similar to Input_2)
        O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj, 2), center_offset))
        inner_obj = recolor(1, shift(crop(O, (center_offset[0]+2, center_offset[1]+2), (h*2-4, w*2-4)), (-2, -2)))
        O = paint(O, inner_obj)
        
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object and Colors:** Extract the object, its color, and the background color.
2. **Calculate Dimensions:** Determine the output canvas size and the offset to center the expanded object.
3. **Conditional Expansion:**
   - **Vertical:** Upscale the object vertically, shift it to the center, and add the inner object (1).
   - **Horizontal:** Upscale horizontally, shift to the center, and add the inner object (1).
   - **Cross:**  Upscale both ways, shift, and add the inner object (1). 

**Note:** This is a single version of the code. To provide more versions, I'd need to analyze the two unprovided programs you want to improve on. I could then explore alternative ways to achieve the same output, utilizing different DSL functions and strategies. For instance, I could experiment with functions like `hconcat`, `vconcat`, `hsplit`, and `vsplit` to construct the output grid from smaller pieces.
