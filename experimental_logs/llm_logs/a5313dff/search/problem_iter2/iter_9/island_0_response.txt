## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0:**

The transformation takes the single-color object (5) and creates a larger, hollow version of it, filled with a new color (1) and outlined by the original color (5). The size of the output object is determined by the size of the input object.

**Input 1:**

Similar to Input 0, the transformation creates a larger, hollow version of the input object, filled with a new color (1). However, this time the outline is not a consistent color. Instead, it uses both the original color (5) and the new color (1) in an alternating pattern. 

**Input 2:**

This transformation follows the same principle but is applied multiple times to create a nested structure. The original object acts as a "seed" for the pattern, with larger, hollow versions of it appearing at increasingly larger scales. Each level alternates between the two colors (1 and 2).

## Code Generation:

**Program to be generated (Version 1):**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_color = leastcolor(I)
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  obj = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, obj_color), I))
  s = len(obj)
  O = canvas(bg_color, (2*s+2, 2*s+2))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(obj, 2), (s, s))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(upscale(obj, 1), (s+1, s+1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract object:**  The program first identifies the object and background colors using `leastcolor` and `mostcolor`. It then extracts the object using `toobject` and `ofcolor` and normalizes its position with `normalize`.
2. **Create canvas:** A canvas is created with the background color and dimensions based on the object's size.
3. **Generate outer shape:** The object is upscaled and shifted to the center of the canvas, then painted with color '2'. 
4. **Generate inner shape:** The object is upscaled again but with a smaller factor and shifted to be inside the previously drawn shape, then painted with color '1'.

**Program to be generated (Version 2):**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_color = leastcolor(I)
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  obj = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, obj_color), I))
  s = len(obj)
  O = canvas(bg_color, (2*s+2, 2*s+2))
  outer_box = shift(upscale(box(obj), 2), (s, s))
  inner_box = shift(upscale(box(obj), 1), (s+1, s+1))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, outer_box))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, inner_box))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on drawing the outlines first:

1. **Extract object and calculate dimensions:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Create canvas:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Generate outlines:** The `box` function is used to get the outline of the object. These outlines are then upscaled and shifted to their respective positions.
4. **Paint outlines:** The outlines are painted with their respective colors.

**Program to be generated (Version 3):**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_color = leastcolor(I)
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  obj = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, obj_color), I))
  s = len(obj)
  O = paint(canvas(bg_color, (2*s+2, 2*s+2)), recolor(2, shift(upscale(obj, 2), (s, s))))
  for i in range(s+1, s+s+1):
    for j in range(s+1, s+s+1):
      if (i == s+1 or i == s+s or j == s+1 or j == s+s) and O[i][j] == bg_color:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i,j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the inner square to paint the outline:

1. **Extract object and calculate dimensions:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create canvas and paint the outer shape:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Iterate and paint inner outline:**  The program iterates through the cells of the inner square and paints those on the border with color '1' if they are the background color.

 **Program to be generated (Version 4):**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_color = leastcolor(I)
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  obj = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, obj_color), I))
  s = len(obj)
  O = canvas(bg_color, (2*s+2, 2*s+2))
  O = underpaint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(obj, 2), (s, s))))
  O = underpaint(O, recolor(1, shift(upscale(obj, 1), (s+1, s+1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes `underpaint` for a more concise solution:

1. **Extract object and calculate dimensions:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create canvas:** Same as previous versions.
3. **Paint shapes:**  Uses `underpaint` to paint the shapes, ensuring only the background is overwritten.

**Program to be generated (Version 5):**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_color = leastcolor(I)
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  obj = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, obj_color), I))
  s = len(obj)
  O = canvas(1, (2*s+2, 2*s+2))
  O = paint(O, recolor(bg_color, shift(upscale(obj, 1), (s+1, s+1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(obj, 2), (s, s))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages a reversed painting order:

1. **Extract object and calculate dimensions:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create canvas with inner color:** The canvas is created with the inner color (1).
3. **Paint inner shape with background color:** The inner shape is painted with the background color.
4. **Paint the outer shape:** The outer shape is painted with color '2', overwriting any overlapping areas. 

These are just five examples, and there might be many other ways to achieve the desired transformations using the DSL functions. The key is to understand the transformation logic and leverage the available functions creatively.
