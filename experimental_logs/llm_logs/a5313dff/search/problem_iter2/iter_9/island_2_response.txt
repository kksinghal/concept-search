## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the object in the input grid, scaling it up by a factor of 2 or 3 (depending on its dimensions), and then strategically placing it within a larger canvas. The placement and orientation of the scaled object depend on the original object's height-width ratio. The remaining space in the canvas is then filled with specific values.

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

* **Object Identification:** The input has a single object consisting of the digit '5'.
* **Scaling:** The object is scaled up by a factor of 2 (since height equals width).
* **Placement:** The scaled object is shifted by (1,1) on an 8x8 canvas.
* **Filling:**  A smaller rectangle within the placed object is filled with '1', while the remaining canvas remains '0'.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

* **Object Identification:** Same as above.
* **Scaling:** The object is scaled up by a factor of 2.
* **Placement:** This time, the object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and shifted by (3,3) on an 8x8 canvas. 
* **Filling:** Similar to output 0, a smaller rectangle within the placed object is filled with '1', and the rest of the canvas remains '0'.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

* **Object Identification:** Same as above.
* **Scaling:** The object is scaled up by a factor of 3 (since height equals width).
* **Placement:** The object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, placed at (3,3) and then its copy is placed at (9, 0) on a 12x12 canvas.
* **Filling:** Two smaller rectangles are filled with '1' within the placed objects, and the rest of the canvas remains '0'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  factor = 2 if height(obj) > width(obj) else 3
  canvas_size = (8, 8) if factor == 2 else (12, 12)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  scaled_obj = upscale(toindices(obj), factor)
  
  if height(obj) > width(obj):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(TWO, scaled_obj), (1, 1)))
    for i in range(1 + factor, 1 + factor * height(obj) - factor + 1):
      for j in range(1 + factor, 1 + factor * width(obj) - factor + 1):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  else:
    rotated_obj = rot90(toindices(obj))
    rotated_obj = upscale(rotated_obj, factor)
    O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (9, 0)))
    for i in range(3 + factor, 3 + factor * width(obj) - factor + 1):
      for j in range(3 + factor, 3 + factor * height(obj) - factor + 1):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
    if factor == 3:
      for i in range(9 + factor, 9 + factor * width(obj) - factor + 1):
        for j in range(factor, factor * height(obj) - factor + 1):
          O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version identifies the object and scales it. 
* Based on height-width comparison, it either directly places the scaled object or rotates it before placement. 
* The `for` loops precisely fill the inner rectangle based on the scaling factor and object dimensions.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  factor = 2 if height(obj) > width(obj) else 3
  canvas_size = (8, 8) if factor == 2 else (12, 12)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  scaled_obj = upscale(toindices(obj), factor)

  if height(obj) > width(obj):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(TWO, scaled_obj), (1, 1)))
    inner_box = crop(O, (1 + factor, 1 + factor), (factor * (height(obj) - 2) + 1, factor * (width(obj) - 2) + 1))
    O = paint(O, fill(inner_box, ONE, asindices(inner_box)))
  else:
    rotated_obj = rot90(toindices(obj))
    rotated_obj = upscale(rotated_obj, factor)
    O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (9, 0)))
    inner_box = crop(O, (3 + factor, 3 + factor), (factor * (width(obj) - 2) + 1, factor * (height(obj) - 2) + 1))
    O = paint(O, fill(inner_box, ONE, asindices(inner_box)))
    if factor == 3:
      inner_box_2 = crop(O, (9 + factor, factor), (factor * (width(obj) - 2) + 1, factor * (height(obj) - 2) + 1))
      O = paint(O, fill(inner_box_2, ONE, asindices(inner_box_2)))
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

* This version leverages the `crop` function to directly obtain the inner rectangle to be filled. 
* It then uses `fill` and `paint` to achieve the final output.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  factor = 2 if height(obj) > width(obj) else 3
  canvas_size = (8, 8) if factor == 2 else (12, 12)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  scaled_obj = upscale(toindices(obj), factor)

  if height(obj) > width(obj):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(TWO, scaled_obj), (1, 1)))
    O = fill(O, ONE, difference(
      shift(backdrop(scaled_obj), (1, 1)),
      shift(toindices(scaled_obj), (1, 1))
    ))
  else:
    rotated_obj = rot90(toindices(obj))
    rotated_obj = upscale(rotated_obj, factor)
    O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (9, 0)))
    O = fill(O, ONE, difference(
      shift(backdrop(rotated_obj), (3, 3)),
      shift(toindices(rotated_obj), (3, 3))
    ))
    if factor == 3:
      O = fill(O, ONE, difference(
        shift(backdrop(rotated_obj), (9, 0)),
        shift(toindices(rotated_obj), (9, 0))
      ))
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

* This version cleverly uses set operations to identify the region to be filled. 
* It calculates the difference between the bounding box (`backdrop`) of the scaled object and the object itself, effectively targeting the inner rectangle.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  factor = 2 if height(obj) > width(obj) else 3
  canvas_size = (8, 8) if factor == 2 else (12, 12)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  scaled_obj = upscale(toindices(obj), factor)

  if height(obj) > width(obj):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(TWO, scaled_obj), (1, 1)))
    inner_indices = apply(
        lambda loc: (loc[0] + 1 + factor, loc[1] + 1 + factor),
        product(range(height(obj) - 2), range(width(obj) - 2))
    )
    O = fill(O, ONE, inner_indices)
  else:
    rotated_obj = rot90(toindices(obj))
    rotated_obj = upscale(rotated_obj, factor)
    O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (9, 0)))
    inner_indices = apply(
        lambda loc: (loc[0] + 3 + factor, loc[1] + 3 + factor),
        product(range(width(obj) - 2), range(height(obj) - 2))
    )
    O = fill(O, ONE, inner_indices)
    if factor == 3:
      inner_indices_2 = apply(
          lambda loc: (loc[0] + 9 + factor, loc[1] + factor),
          product(range(width(obj) - 2), range(height(obj) - 2))
      )
      O = fill(O, ONE, inner_indices_2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly calculates the indices of the inner rectangle using `product` and `apply`. 
* It then uses `fill` to place the '1's at the calculated locations.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  factor = 2 if height(obj) > width(obj) else 3
  canvas_size = (8, 8) if factor == 2 else (12, 12)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  scaled_obj = upscale(toindices(obj), factor)

  if height(obj) > width(obj):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(TWO, scaled_obj), (1, 1)))
    O = underfill(O, ONE, shift(backdrop(crop(
      canvas(ZERO, shape(scaled_obj)),
      (1, 1), 
      (shape(scaled_obj)[0]-2, shape(scaled_obj)[1]-2)
      )), (1, 1)))
  else:
    rotated_obj = rot90(toindices(obj))
    rotated_obj = upscale(rotated_obj, factor)
    O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (9, 0)))
    O = underfill(O, ONE, shift(backdrop(crop(
      canvas(ZERO, shape(rotated_obj)),
      (1, 1),
      (shape(rotated_obj)[0]-2, shape(rotated_obj)[1]-2)
      )), (3, 3)))
    if factor == 3:
      O = underfill(O, ONE, shift(backdrop(crop(
        canvas(ZERO, shape(rotated_obj)),
        (1, 1), 
        (shape(rotated_obj)[0]-2, shape(rotated_obj)[1]-2)
        )), (9, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes `underfill` to place the '1's only where the canvas is '0' within the specified bounding box. 
* This approach avoids overwriting any existing non-zero values.

These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different combinations of functions and logic, illustrating the diverse ways to solve a problem within a defined programming environment.
