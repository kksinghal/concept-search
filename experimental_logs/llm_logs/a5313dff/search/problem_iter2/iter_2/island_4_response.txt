## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

* The input object (a diagonal line of 5s) is upscaled by a factor of 2. 
* A smaller, centered copy of the object is drawn inside the upscaled version using the value '1'.
* The entire output is placed on a larger canvas of 0s.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

* The input object (a diagonal line of 5s) is upscaled by a factor of 2 horizontally.
* A smaller, centered copy of the object is drawn inside the upscaled version using the value '1'.
* The entire output is placed on a larger canvas of 0s, with the object positioned slightly to the right.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**

* The input object (a diagonal line of 5s) is upscaled by a factor of 2 horizontally and 4 vertically.
* A smaller, centered copy of the object is drawn inside the upscaled version using the value '1'.
* Additional '2' values are strategically placed around the upscaled object to create a specific pattern.
* The entire output is placed on a larger canvas of 0s.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, F, F, T))
  O = canvas(0, (height(I)*4, width(I)*4))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, upscale(obj, 2)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(inbox(upscale(obj, 1)), (1, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract the Object:** `obj = first(objects(I, F, F, T))` extracts the first object (non-background connected component) from the input grid 'I'.
2.  **Create a Canvas:**  `O = canvas(0, (height(I)*4, width(I)*4))` creates a canvas 'O' filled with '0's, four times the height and width of the input.
3.  **Upscale and Paint:** `O = paint(O, recolor(2, upscale(obj, 2)))` upscales the extracted object 'obj' by a factor of 2, recolors it to '2', and paints it onto the canvas.
4.  **Draw the Inner Shape:** `O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(inbox(upscale(obj, 1)), (1, 1))))` upscales the object by 1 (effectively no upscaling), finds the indices within its bounding box (`inbox`), shifts these indices by (1,1) to center it, recolors the resulting patch to '1', and paints it on the canvas.
5.  **Return the Output:** The function returns the transformed canvas 'O'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, F, F, T))
  O = upscale(obj, 2)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(O)), recolor(2, O))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(inbox(obj), (1, 1))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Object & Upscale:** Similar to version 1, this version first extracts the object and directly upscales it by 2, storing it in 'O'.
2.  **Create Canvas based on Upscaled Object:** A canvas of 0s is created with dimensions matching the upscaled object 'O'.
3.  **Paint Upscaled Object:** The upscaled object 'O' is recoloured to '2' and painted onto the canvas.
4.  **Draw Inner Shape (Using Original Object):** This version utilizes the original object's `inbox` for drawing the inner shape, shifting it for centering and recoloring it to '1' before painting.
5.  **Return Output:**  The modified canvas 'O' is returned. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, F, F, T))
  factor = 2
  O = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), factor))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, upscale(obj, factor)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(inbox(obj), (factor//2, factor//2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to the previous ones, but introduces a `factor` variable for the upscaling factor. It clarifies the centering of the inner shape by using `factor//2` for both row and column shifts. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, F, F, T))
  upscaled_obj = upscale(obj, 2)
  inner_obj = shift(inbox(obj), (1, 1))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(upscaled_obj)), recolor(2, upscaled_obj))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, inner_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on code readability by pre-computing the `upscaled_obj` and `inner_obj` before painting them onto the canvas. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, F, F, T))
  O = paint(
      paint(
          canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), 2)), 
          recolor(2, upscale(obj, 2))
      ), 
      recolor(1, shift(inbox(obj), (1, 1)))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the painting operations into a single line using nested `paint` calls for conciseness. It directly uses the multiplication operation `multiply(shape(I), 2)` for calculating the canvas size.


**Note:** The provided programs and explanations focus on the core transformation logic.  The exact placement of the "2" values in Output 2 might require slight adjustments to the `shift` function's arguments or additional logic for specific cases.
