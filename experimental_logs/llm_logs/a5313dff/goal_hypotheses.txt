For each shape, fill any empty cells directly to the left or right of a colored cell within that shape's bounding box with the color 1. "]['The output grid is a compressed version of the input grid, with the colored squares clustered together and surrounded by empty space. The shape of the cluster depends on the position of the colored squares in the input.', 'The output grid represents a simplified version of the input grid, where the colored squares are grouped together and their arrangement reflects the original pattern. The size and position of the grouping depend on the input.', "The transformation involves identifying the colored squares in the input grid and representing them as a connected cluster in the output grid. The cluster's form and location correspond to the original pattern of colored squares.", "The output grid displays a condensed representation of the input grid, where the colored squares are consolidated into a single shape. The shape's structure and placement are determined by the arrangement of colored squares in the input.", "The transformation extracts the pattern of colored squares from the input grid and depicts it as a unified cluster in the output grid. The cluster's size, form, and position mirror the original arrangement of colored squares. "]
