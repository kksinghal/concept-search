## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify specific cells within objects and recolor them. The pattern of recoloring appears to be consistent across different input grids:

* **Input_0:** Every other column within the object is recolored to '2'. 
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, but the recoloring skips a column after each recolored column.
* **Input_2:** Every other column is recolored, but the recoloring pattern alternates between rows.

Essentially, the transformation applies a 'checkerboard' recoloring pattern to specific columns within each object.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  recolored_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_obj.add((2 if j % 2 == i % 2 else v, (i, j)))
    recolored_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** The code iterates through each object and its cells. For each cell, it checks if the column index (`j`) and row index (`i`) have the same parity (both even or both odd). If true, it recolors the cell to '2', otherwise, it retains the original color.
3. **Paint Back:** The recolored objects are merged and painted back onto the input grid to generate the output.


**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != mostcolor(I) and i % 2 == j % 2:
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** This version directly iterates through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check Color and Parity:** For each cell, it checks if it's not the background color and if the row and column indices have the same parity.
3. **Paint Recolored Cell:** If both conditions are true, it paints that cell with color '2' directly onto the output grid.


**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices = asindices(I)
  recolored_indices = sfilter(indices, lambda ij: ij[0] % 2 == ij[1] % 2)
  recolored_obj = recolor(2, recolored_indices)
  O = underpaint(I, recolored_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get All Indices:** `asindices(I)` fetches all cell indices from the grid.
2. **Filter Indices by Parity:** It filters the indices to keep only those where row and column indices have the same parity.
3. **Create Recolored Object:**  A new object is created with color '2' at the filtered indices.
4. **Underpaint:** `underpaint` is used to paint this new object onto the input grid, ensuring only background cells are affected.


**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  checkerboard = tuple(tuple(2 if i % 2 == j % 2 else 0 for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
  O = cellwise(checkerboard, I, mostcolor(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Checkerboard:** This version generates a checkerboard grid of the same size as the input, filled with alternating '2' and background color.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** It uses `cellwise` to compare the checkerboard with the input grid. If both grids have the same value at a specific cell, that value is kept; otherwise, the background color is used.


**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 1)), objs)
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(2, obj), shifted_objs)
  O = underpaint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Shift Objects:** It identifies objects in the grid and shifts them diagonally down and right by one unit.
2. **Recolor Shifted Objects:** The shifted objects are then recolored to '2'.
3. **Underpaint:** The recolored objects are merged and painted onto the original grid using `underpaint`, ensuring only the background is affected.

These are five distinct program versions that achieve the required transformation. Each version leverages different DSL functions and logic, offering diverse approaches to the problem.
