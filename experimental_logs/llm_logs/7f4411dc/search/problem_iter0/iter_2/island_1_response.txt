## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves removing the leftmost column of each object in the input grid. 

**Input 0:** 
- The leftmost '7' of each 7-object is removed.

**Input 1:**
-  The leftmost '6' of each 6-object is removed.

**Input 2:**
-  The leftmost '5' of each 5-object is removed.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's shifting and Program_B's object filtering)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, -1)), objs)  
  cropped_objs = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j >= 0}, shifted_objs) 
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), cropped_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid (`I`) excluding the background.
2. **`shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, -1)), objs)`:** Shifts each object one position to the left.
3. **`cropped_objs = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j >= 0}, shifted_objs)`:** Removes any cell that has been shifted outside the grid's left boundary (j < 0).
4. **`O = paint(cover(I, objs), cropped_objs)`:**  Paints the shifted and cropped objects onto a blank canvas (created by covering the original objects in `I`). 

**Version 2:** (Using object manipulation and set operations)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  new_objs = frozenset({frozenset({(v, (i, j - 1)) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j > leftmost(obj)} for obj in objs)}) 
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), new_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`:** Identifies all objects, excluding the background.
2. **`new_objs = ... `:**  This line generates a new set of objects where each cell is shifted one position to the left, but only if the cell is not the leftmost cell of its object. 
3. **`O = paint(cover(I, objs), new_objs)`:** Paints the new objects onto a cleared canvas.

**Version 3:**  (Focusing on individual cells within objects)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j != leftmost(obj): 
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):`:** Iterates through each object.
3. **`for v, (i, j) in obj:`:**  Iterates through each cell in the current object.
4. **`if j != leftmost(obj): O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j - 1))})`:** If the cell is not the leftmost cell of the object, paint it one position to the left on the canvas.

**Version 4:** (Using `cellwise` for a direct comparison approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), (0, -1)) 
  O = cellwise(
    a = I, 
    b = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_grid), 
    fallback = mostcolor(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), (0, -1))`:**  Creates a shifted version of the entire input grid as an object.
2. **`paint(canvas(...), shifted_grid)`:** Paints the shifted object onto a blank canvas.
3. **`cellwise(a = I, b = ..., fallback=mostcolor(I))`:** Compares the original grid (`I`) with the shifted grid. If the values match, the original value is kept. If they don't match, the background color is used, effectively removing the shifted cells that were originally on the leftmost edge.

**Version 5:** (Leveraging grid splitting and concatenation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  left, right = hsplit(I, 2)
  O = hconcat(
      (tuple(tuple(mostcolor(I) for _ in range(len(left[0]))) for _ in range(len(left))),), 
      right
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`left, right = hsplit(I, 2)`:** Splits the input grid into two halves vertically.
2. **`hconcat((tuple(tuple(...) for _ in range(...)) for _ in range(...)), right)`:**  Creates a new grid by concatenating a blank grid (same height as `left` and one column wide) with the `right` half. This effectively removes the leftmost column of the original grid.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the required transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
