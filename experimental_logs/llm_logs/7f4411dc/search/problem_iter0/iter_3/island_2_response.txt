## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves removing objects that touch the top or bottom edge of the grid. 

**Input 0:** The top and bottom rows of 7s are removed, leaving only the objects in the middle.

**Input 1:** The single 6s at the top and bottom edges are removed, as well as the 6 that extends to the bottom edge. The main object remains.

**Input 2:** The 5s touching the top and bottom edges are removed.

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, True, False)  # Extract all objects
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) > 0 and lowermost(obj) < height(I) - 1)  # Filter objects
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create output canvas
  for obj in filtered_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint remaining objects onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `objects(I, False, True, False)` extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **Filter objects:** `sfilter` keeps only the objects that satisfy the condition: their uppermost row index is greater than 0 (not touching the top edge) and their lowermost row index is smaller than the grid height - 1 (not touching the bottom edge).
3. **Create canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
4. **Paint objects:** The code iterates through the filtered objects and paints each one onto the canvas.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(sfilter(objects(I, False, True, False), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and filter objects:** This part combines object extraction and filtering in a single line. `objects` extracts all objects, and `sfilter` keeps only those that don't touch the grid borders (`bordering` function).
2. **Create canvas and paint:**  Similar to version 1, it creates a blank canvas and then paints the merged filtered objects onto it. This version achieves the same result with more concise code.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, True, False)
  top_bottom_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i in (0, len(I)-1) for j in range(len(I[0])))
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not any(index in toindices(obj) for index in top_bottom_indices))
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in filtered_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify top and bottom indices:** This version precomputes the indices of the top and bottom rows.
2. **Filter objects based on indices:** It filters objects that have any cell index present in the precomputed top and bottom indices.
3. **Canvas creation and painting:** This part remains similar to the previous versions.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  h = height(I)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(sfilter(objects(I, False, True, False), lambda obj: all(0 < i < h-1 for i, j in toindices(obj)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get grid height:** This version directly retrieves the grid height using `height(I)`.
2. **Filter objects based on cell indices:** It filters objects where all cell row indices are strictly between 0 and the grid height - 1.
3. **Canvas creation and painting:** Similar to previous versions.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  h = height(I)
  return fill(I, mostcolor(I), merge(sfilter(apply(toindices, objects(I, False, True, False)), lambda indices: any(i in (0, h - 1) for i, _ in indices))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get grid height:** Similar to version 4.
2. **Extract object indices:** It extracts indices for each object using `apply(toindices, objects(I, False, True, False))`.
3. **Filter objects based on indices:** It filters the extracted indices, keeping those where any row index is 0 or the grid height - 1 (touching top or bottom edge).
4. **Fill cells with background color:** Instead of creating a new canvas and painting, this version directly fills the cells corresponding to the filtered indices with the background color, effectively removing objects touching the top and bottom edges.


These five program versions provide diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation using different DSL function combinations and logic.
