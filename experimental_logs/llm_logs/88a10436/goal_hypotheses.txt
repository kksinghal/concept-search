['Copy the input grid. Then, slide each colored shape down until the top of the shape aligns with the row containing the gray square.', 'Copy the input grid. Then, move all the colored shapes down so that their top edges are in the same row as the gray square.', 'Slide all the colored shapes down until their top row aligns with the row of the gray square.', 'Copy the input grid. Then, for each colored shape, move it down so that its top edge is in the same row as the gray square.', 'For each colored shape, shift it downwards until its top edge is on the same row as the gray square. ']['Move the colored shapes above the gray shape so that the top left corner of the colored shape is just above the bottom left corner of the gray shape.', 'Slide the colored shapes directly upwards until they are positioned directly above the gray square, maintaining their original shape.', 'Shift the colored objects upwards, aligning their bottom left corner with the top left corner of the gray square.', 'For each colored shape, move it directly above the gray square, aligning the bottom left corners.', 'Relocate the colored shapes to a position directly above the gray square, ensuring their bottom left corners align. ']['Take the upper left 5x5 section of the input grid and rotate it 90 degrees clockwise to create the output grid.', 'Extract the top-left 5x5 square from the input, rotate it clockwise by 90 degrees, and that becomes the output.', 'The transformation involves selecting the top left 5x5 portion of the input grid and rotating it 90 degrees clockwise to form the output grid.', 'The output is generated by taking the upper left 5x5 section of the input and rotating it 90 degrees to the right.', 'Select the top left 5x5 area of the input grid, rotate this selection 90 degrees clockwise, and this becomes the output grid.
