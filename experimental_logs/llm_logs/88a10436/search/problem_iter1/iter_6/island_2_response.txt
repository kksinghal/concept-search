## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be moving non-zero value objects to the bottom-left corner while preserving their relative positions and orientations. Let's break it down for each example:

**Input_0:** The object consisting of digits '1', '2', and '3' is moved down and left, occupying the bottom-left corner.

**Input_1:**  Similarly, the object made of '1', '2', and '6' is shifted down and left, maintaining its original shape.

**Input_2:**  Again, the non-zero object (digits '1', '2', and '3') is moved to the bottom-left, retaining its relative position and form.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  h = max([lowermost(obj) for obj in objs] + [0]) + 1
  w = max([rightmost(obj) for obj in objs] + [0]) + 1
  grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for obj in objs:
    grid = paint(grid, shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, False, False, True)` extracts non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Dimensions:** Determine the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the output grid based on the maximum extents of the objects.
3. **Create Canvas:**  `canvas(0, (h, w))` generates an empty grid of the calculated dimensions.
4. **Move and Paint:** For each object, calculate its new position based on its original position and the output grid's dimensions. Then, paint the object onto the canvas at the new location using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Generate an empty output grid `O` with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** Loop through each non-background object in `I`.
3. **Calculate Offset:**  Determine the required shift for each object to position it at the bottom-left corner.
4. **Paint Shifted Object:** Paint each shifted object onto the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  return paint(canvas(0, (h, w)), merge({shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Get Grid Dimensions:**  Retrieve the height and width of the input grid.
3. **Create Canvas:** Generate an empty grid with the same dimensions as the input.
4. **Calculate Offsets and Shift:** Determine the shift amounts for each object and move them to the bottom-left corner.
5. **Merge and Paint:** Combine all the shifted objects and paint them onto the canvas in a single step.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))), objects(I, F, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Calculate Offsets and Shift:** Use `apply` and a lambda function to iterate through objects, calculate their shifts, and move them to the bottom-left corner.
3. **Merge and Paint:** Merge all the shifted objects and paint them onto a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  return merge(apply(lambda obj: paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj)))), objects(I, F, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Generate an empty output grid `O`.
2. **Extract Objects:** Extract non-background objects from the input grid.
3. **Shift, Paint, and Merge:**  Use `apply` and a lambda function to iterate through the objects. For each object:
    - Calculate the offset to move it to the bottom-left corner.
    - Shift the object using the calculated offset.
    - Paint the shifted object onto the output grid `O`.
4. **Return Output Grid:** Return the modified output grid `O` containing all the shifted objects.

These five versions utilize different combinations of DSL functions and logic flow while achieving the same transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving this spatial reasoning task.
