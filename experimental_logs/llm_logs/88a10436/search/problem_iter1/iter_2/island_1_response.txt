## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects in the input grid and moving them to the bottom-left corner while maintaining their relative positions. 

**Input_0:** 
- The object consisting of digits '1', '2', and '3' is moved to the bottom-left corner. 

**Input_1:** 
-  Similarly, the object with digits '1', '2', and '6' is shifted to the bottom-left corner.

**Input_2:**
-  Here, two separate objects are identified ('2' and '3,1'). Both are moved independently to occupy the bottom-left space without overlapping.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using functions from the DSL (dsl.py) to achieve the desired transformation.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  h, w = shape(I)
  for obj in objs:
    height_obj = height(obj)
    moved_objs = moved_objs.union({shift(obj, (h - height_obj - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj)))})
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Non-Background Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` separates the input grid `I` into distinct objects, excluding the background.
2. **Calculate Shift Amount:** For each object, determine the vertical shift amount (`h - height_obj - uppermost(obj)`) to move it to the bottom.  `-leftmost(obj)` calculates the horizontal shift to align it to the left edge.
3. **Shift Objects:** `shift(obj, (vertical_shift, horizontal_shift))` moves each object to its new position.
4. **Combine Objects:** `merge(moved_objs)` combines all shifted objects into a single object set.
5. **Paint on Canvas:** `paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merged_objs)` creates a new grid with the background color and paints the combined objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcommon(I):
        new_i = len(I) - i - 1
        new_j = j - leftmost(ofcolor(I, val))
        O = paint(O, {(val, (new_i, new_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an empty output grid `O` filled with the background color using `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`.
2. **Iterate and Relocate:** Loop through each cell of the input grid `I`. If a cell doesn't belong to the background, calculate its new position (`new_i`, `new_j`) by mirroring vertically and aligning to the left edge.
3. **Paint on Output:**  `paint(O, {(val, (new_i, new_j))})` places the cell with its value `val` at the calculated position in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies distinct non-background objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **Create Canvas:** Generate a canvas `O` with the background color and dimensions of the input using `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`.
3. **Shift and Paint:** For each object:
    - Calculate its shift amount: move it vertically to the bottom (`height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj)`) and horizontally to the left edge (`-leftmost(obj)`).
    - Use `shift(obj, (vertical_shift, horizontal_shift))` to relocate the object.
    - Paint the shifted object onto the canvas using `paint(O, shifted_obj)`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
               merge({shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))) 
               for obj in fgpartition(I)}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic of Version 3 into a single line for conciseness. It directly paints the merged set of shifted objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
               merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, 
                                                (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), 
                                                 -leftmost(obj))),
                                                fgpartition(I))))
```
**Explanation:**

This version further refactors Version 4 by using the `apply` function to apply a lambda function (which calculates the shift amounts and shifts each object) to each object identified by `fgpartition(I)`. It then merges the shifted objects and paints them onto the canvas. 

These five programs showcase different approaches to solving the transformation using the provided DSL. They utilize a variety of functions and demonstrate alternative ways to achieve the desired output, showcasing the flexibility and power of DSLs for specific tasks.
