## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** Each object in the input grid is moved diagonally down and right until its upper-left corner touches the diagonal line starting from the bottom-left corner of the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Each object in the input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  Each object in the input grid is moved up until it touches another object or the top border of the grid. 


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    h = height(obj)
    u = uppermost(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h - u, h - u)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identify all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, F, F, T)`.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty output grid `O` of the same size as the input using `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`.
3. **Iterate and Shift:** For each object `obj`:
   - Calculate the desired vertical and horizontal shift `(h - u, h - u)`, where `h` is the object's height and `u` is the row index of its uppermost cell. This ensures the object moves diagonally until its top-left corner touches the diagonal.
   - Paint the shifted object onto the output grid using `paint(O, shift(obj, (h - u, h - u)))`.
4. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return rot270(I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate:**  Rotate the entire input grid `I` by 270 degrees counter-clockwise using `rot270(I)`.
2. **Return Output:** Return the rotated grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    u = uppermost(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-u, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identify all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, F, F, T)`.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty output grid `O` of the same size as the input using `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`.
3. **Iterate and Shift:** For each object `obj`:
   - Calculate the desired vertical shift `-u`, where `u` is the row index of its uppermost cell. This ensures the object moves up until its top touches the top border or another object.
   - Paint the shifted object onto the output grid using `paint(O, shift(obj, (-u, 0)))`.
4. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:** (Alternative for Input_0 to Output_0)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (len(objs) - i - 1, len(objs) - i - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version exploits the specific arrangement in Input_0 where objects are roughly diagonal. It shifts each object down and right by an amount determined by its index in the object list. This achieves a similar diagonal movement as Version 1.

**Program Version 5:** (Alternative for Input_2 to Output_2)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return vconcat(compress(I), crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I) - height(compress(I)), width(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a different approach by compressing the input grid vertically to remove empty rows at the top and then concatenating the compressed grid with the removed rows.


**Note:** These are just five possible solutions. Other valid programs can be constructed using different combinations of functions from the DSL.
