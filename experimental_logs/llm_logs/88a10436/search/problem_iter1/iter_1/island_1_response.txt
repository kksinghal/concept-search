## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background objects to the bottom left corner of the grid while preserving their relative positions. 

**Input_0:**
- The '221' and '13' objects are moved to the bottom left, maintaining their relative positions.

**Input_1:**
- The '6', '11', '222' and '5' objects are moved to the bottom left, maintaining their relative positions.

**Input_2:**
- The '5', '22', '31' and '331' objects are moved to the bottom left, maintaining their relative positions.


## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    shift_amount = (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))
    moved_objs = moved_objs.union({shift(obj, shift_amount)})
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Shift:** For each object, `(-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))` calculates the shift required to move its upper-left corner to (0, 0).
3. **Shift Objects:** `shift(obj, shift_amount)` moves each object to the bottom-left corner.
4. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates a new grid filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input.
5. **Paint Objects:** `paint(canvas, merge(moved_objs))` paints all moved objects onto the new canvas, effectively merging them.
6. **Return Output:** The program returns the new grid `O` containing the transformed image.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  moved = frozenset()
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcommon(I):
        moved = insert((val, (i, j)), moved)
  shifted = apply(lambda x: (x[0], (x[1][0], x[1][1] - leftmost(moved))), moved)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Non-Background Cells:** Iterates through each cell and adds non-background cells to the `moved` set.
2. **Find Leftmost Column:** `leftmost(moved)` finds the leftmost column containing a non-background cell.
3. **Shift Cells:** `apply` and the lambda function shift each cell leftward by the `leftmost` value.
4. **Create Canvas and Paint:** Similar to Version 1, this part creates a new canvas and paints the shifted cells.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j - leftmost(ofcolor(I, val))))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Starts with a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** Iterates through cells, and for each non-background cell:
   - `leftmost(ofcolor(I, val))` finds the leftmost occurrence of that color.
   - It then paints the cell onto the canvas, shifted leftward.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(objs))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies all non-background objects.
2. **Create Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas.
3. **Shift and Paint:** For each object, calculates the leftward shift based on the leftmost object (`-leftmost(objs)`) and shifts the object accordingly before painting it.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  moved = {(v, (i, j - min(j for k, row in enumerate(I) for l, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcommon(I) and k == i))) 
           for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcommon(I)}
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), moved)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Shift:** Uses a set comprehension to identify non-background cells and directly calculate their shifted positions within the comprehension.
2. **Create Canvas and Paint:** Similar to previous versions, it creates a canvas and paints the shifted cells.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic combinations. Each version aims to be concise and efficient while achieving the desired outcome.
