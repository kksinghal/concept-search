## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking each non-background object in the input grid, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, and then moving it downwards. The movement downwards is dependent on the height of the object itself:

* **Input_0:** Each object (formed by digits 1, 2, and 3, 5) is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The rotated object is then moved downwards by a number of units equal to its own height. 
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, each object (digits 1, 2, 5, and 6) is rotated and shifted down by its height.
* **Input_2:**  Again, each object (digits 2, 3, and 5) is rotated and moved down according to its height.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)  # Extract non-background objects
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    h = height(obj)
    offset = (h, 0)  # Downward offset based on object height
    rotated_obj = rot90(togrid(obj, I))
    moved_obj = asobject(shift(togrid(rotated_obj, I), offset))
    moved_objs = combine(moved_objs, {moved_obj})
  O = paint(I, merge(moved_objs))
  return O

def togrid(obj, grid):
    canvas_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))
    return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Transform:**  For each `obj`:
   - Calculate its `height` (`h`).
   - Define a downward `offset`  equal to its height.
   - Rotate the object 90 degrees clockwise (`rotated_obj`).
   - Shift the `rotated_obj` downwards using the calculated `offset`.
   - Add the transformed object to the `moved_objs` set.
3. **Paint to Output:** Combine all `moved_objs` and paint them onto the input grid `I` to create the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return paint(I, merge(
      {asobject(shift(rot90(togrid(obj, I)), (height(obj), 0))) for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)}
  ))

def togrid(obj, grid):
    canvas_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))
    return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic of version 1 into a single line using set comprehension. It iterates through the objects, rotates them, calculates the offset, shifts them, and paints them onto the input grid, all in one concise expression.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I  
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    O = paint(
        cover(O, obj),  
        asobject(shift(rot90(togrid(obj, I)), (height(obj), 0)))
    )
  return O

def togrid(obj, grid):
    canvas_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))
    return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

This version iteratively modifies the input grid `I`. It covers each object before painting the transformed version in its new position. This approach avoids the need to collect transformed objects in a separate set. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(
      lambda obj: asobject(shift(rot90(togrid(obj, I)), (height(obj), 0))), 
      objects(I, F, F, T)
  )))

def togrid(obj, grid):
    canvas_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))
    return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `apply` function to apply a lambda function to each object in the `objects` set. The lambda function encapsulates the rotation and shifting logic. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    def transform_object(obj):
        return asobject(shift(rot90(togrid(obj, I)), (height(obj), 0)))
    
    transformed_objects = apply(transform_object, objects(I, F, F, T))
    return paint(I, merge(transformed_objects))

def togrid(obj, grid):
    canvas_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))
    return paint(canvas_grid, obj)

```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a separate function `transform_object` to handle the transformation logic for each object, making the code more modular and readable. It then uses the `apply` function to apply this function to all objects and merges the results before painting them onto the input grid.
