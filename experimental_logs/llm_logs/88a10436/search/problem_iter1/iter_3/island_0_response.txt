## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to move objects within the grid towards the bottom-left corner without changing their shape, orientation, or color. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The object formed by the digits '1', '2', and '3' moves down and left until it reaches the bottom-left corner.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The object formed by the digit '6' moves down until it reaches the bottom-left corner.
* The object formed by digits '1' moves down and left by one cell.
* The object formed by digits '2' moves down and left by two cells.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The object formed by digits '2' moves down by one cell.
* The object formed by the digits '3' and '1' move down by two cells. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing the provided DSL functions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(grid) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), -leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We extract all objects from the grid using `objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`.
2. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid is created with `canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))`.
3. **Shift Objects:** Each object is iteratively shifted to its new position using `shift(obj, (height(grid) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), -leftmost(obj)))`. This calculation aligns the object's top-left corner with the bottom-left corner of the grid.
4. **Paint Objects:** The shifted object is painted onto the canvas with `paint(O, shifted_object)`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != mostcolor(grid):
        O = fill(O, value, {(len(grid) - 1 - i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Similar to version 1, a blank canvas is generated.
2. **Iterate & Shift:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell is not the background color, it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid at a shifted position `(len(grid) - 1 - i, j)`. This directly maps cells to their new locations without explicitly extracting objects.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), 
               merge({shift(obj, gravitate(obj, {(0, 0)})) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to version 1.
2. **Calculate Gravitation:** This version utilizes the `gravitate(obj, {(0, 0)})` function to calculate the necessary shift for each object to be adjacent to the top-left corner (acting as a gravitational pull). 
3. **Shift and Merge:** Objects are then shifted using the calculated gravitation and merged into a single object set.
4. **Paint Objects:** The merged object set is painted onto the canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return rot180(fjdcjbicgcbeefibaijggjdcdeafdfae(rot180(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version cleverly reuses "Program_A" by rotating the input grid by 180 degrees, applying "Program_A", and then rotating the result back by 180 degrees.  Since "Program_A" essentially moves objects upwards, rotating the input and output effectively achieves the desired bottom-leftward movement.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    O = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))
    for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w):
        if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid):
          new_i = h - 1 - i
          new_j = j 
          O = fill(O, grid[i][j], {(new_i, new_j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over the input grid and directly copies non-background cells to their new positions in the output grid. It calculates the new positions based on the height of the grid, ensuring they are placed in the bottom-left corner.
