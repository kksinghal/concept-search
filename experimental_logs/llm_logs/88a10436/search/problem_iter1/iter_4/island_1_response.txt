## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the non-background objects in the input grid to the bottom-left corner, while maintaining their relative positions within the grid. 

* **Example 1:** The '2 2 1' object and '1 3' object are moved to the bottom left, maintaining their relative positions.
* **Example 2:** The '6', '1 1', and '2 2 2' objects are moved to the bottom left, again preserving their relative arrangement.
* **Example 3:** Similar to the previous examples, the '2 2' and '3 1\n3 3 1' objects are shifted to the bottom left, retaining their spatial relationship.

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w))` generates an empty grid of the same size as `I`, filled with the background color.
3. **Shift and Paint:** For each object `obj`, we calculate its new position by shifting it to the bottom left corner using `shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj)))`. This ensures the object is placed against both the bottom and left edges. Finally, the object is painted onto the canvas `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return paint(
           canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
           merge(
             apply(
               lambda obj: shift(
                             obj,
                             (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj),
                              -leftmost(obj))
                           ),
               fgpartition(I)
             )
           )
         )
```

**Explanation:**

This version streamlines the logic by utilizing nested function calls:

1. **Canvas and Partitioning:** Similar to version 1, we create an empty canvas and partition the input grid into objects.
2. **Apply Shift:** `apply(lambda obj: shift(...), fgpartition(I))` applies a lambda function to each object, calculating its shifted position towards the bottom-left.
3. **Merge and Paint:** The shifted objects are merged into a single object using `merge()`. Finally, this combined object is painted onto the canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
    merge({shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))) for obj in fgpartition(I)})
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version further condenses the code using set comprehension:

1. **Canvas and Partitioning:** Identical to previous versions.
2. **Set Comprehension for Shifting:** The shifting logic is embedded within a set comprehension, generating a set of shifted objects.
3. **Merge and Paint:** Similar to the previous versions, the shifted objects are merged and painted onto the canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  h = height(I)
  for obj in objs:
    transformed_objs = transformed_objs.union(
                        {shift(
                          obj,
                          (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj),
                          -leftmost(obj))
                        )
                      }
                    )
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on clarity by explicitly creating a set of transformed objects:

1. **Object Partitioning and Initialization:** We partition the input grid into objects and initialize an empty `transformed_objs` set.
2. **Iterative Transformation:** The code iterates through each object, calculates its shifted position, and adds it to the `transformed_objs` set.
3. **Canvas, Merge, and Paint:** Similar to previous versions, an empty canvas is created, the transformed objects are merged, and finally, painted onto the canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    new_i = h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj)
    new_j = -leftmost(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (new_i, new_j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version prioritizes readability by explicitly calculating the new coordinates:

1. **Canvas and Partitioning:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Calculate New Coordinates:** For each object, we calculate its new `i` and `j` coordinates, representing its bottom-left corner position.
3. **Shift and Paint:** The object is then shifted to these new coordinates and painted onto the canvas.

These five versions offer diverse implementations for the described transformation while achieving the desired output for all provided input grids. Each version leverages different DSL functions and programming constructs to provide clarity and efficiency.
