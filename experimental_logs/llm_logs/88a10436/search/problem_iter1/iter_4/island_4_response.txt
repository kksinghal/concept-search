## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**  Each non-background object in the input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then shifted down by its original height. 

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**  Similar to the first transformation, each non-background object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. However, instead of shifting down, the objects are shifted to the left by their original height.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**  This transformation only affects objects with values '2' and '3'. These objects are shifted up by two rows.  

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    rotated_obj = asobject(rot90(togrid(obj, I)))
    O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, (height(obj) * (1 - 2*(leftmost(obj)==0)), 0)))
  return O

def togrid(obj, grid):
  """Convert object to grid representation."""
  canvas_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Transform:** The code iterates through each object `obj` and applies the following transformations:
    - **Rotation:** `rot90(togrid(obj, I))` rotates the object 90 degrees clockwise.
    - **Shifting:** `shift(rotated_obj, (height(obj) * (1 - 2*(leftmost(obj)==0)), 0))` shifts the rotated object:
      - If the object's leftmost column is 0 (touching the left edge), it shifts down by its height.
      - Otherwise, it shifts up by its height.
3. **Paint to Output:** The rotated and shifted object is then painted onto a copy of the input grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({asobject(shift(rot90(togrid(obj, I)), (height(obj) * (1 - 2*(leftmost(obj)==0)), 0))) for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)}))

def togrid(obj, grid):
  """Convert object to grid representation."""
  canvas_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic of version 1 into a single line using set comprehension and the `merge` function. It iterates through the objects, rotates and shifts them based on their position, and then paints them onto the input grid in one step.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    return asobject(shift(rot90(togrid(obj, I)), (height(obj) * (1 - 2*(leftmost(obj)==0)), 0)))

  return paint(I, merge(apply(transform_object, objects(I, F, F, T))))

def togrid(obj, grid):
  """Convert object to grid representation."""
  canvas_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `transform_object` to encapsulate the rotation and shifting logic. It improves readability and modularity.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge([asobject(shift(rot90(togrid(obj, I)), (height(obj) if leftmost(obj) else -height(obj), 0))) for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)]))

def togrid(obj, grid):
  """Convert object to grid representation."""
  canvas_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses Python's conditional expression within the `shift` function to determine the direction of the shift (up or down) based on the object's leftmost column position.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def conditional_shift(obj, direction):
    return shift(obj, (height(obj) * direction, 0))

  return paint(I, merge([asobject(conditional_shift(rot90(togrid(obj, I)), -1 if leftmost(obj) else 1)) for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)]))

def togrid(obj, grid):
  """Convert object to grid representation."""
  canvas_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

This version further abstracts the shifting logic by introducing a `conditional_shift` function. This function takes the object and a direction (1 for down, -1 for up) as input, making the code more flexible and readable.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using a variety of DSL functions and programming constructs. Each version aims to balance efficiency, readability, and modularity.
