## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in these input-output pairs involves taking the non-background objects, rotating them 90 degrees clockwise, and then placing them below their original position. The exact offset of this placement seems to be dependent on the object's height.

**Example:**

* **Input_0:** The object consisting of digits 1, 2, and 3 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then moved down and slightly to the right.
* **Input_1:** The object with digits 1 and 2 is rotated and placed directly below its original position. The object with digit 6 is also rotated and placed below.
* **Input_2:**  Similar to the other examples, the objects are rotated and placed below, with the offset seemingly linked to their size.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, utilizing different approaches and DSL function combinations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)  # Extract non-background objects
    moved_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        h = height(obj)
        offset = (h, 1)  # Downward offset based on object height
        rotated_obj = rot90(togrid(obj, I))
        moved_obj = asobject(shift(togrid(rotated_obj, I), offset))
        moved_objs = combine(moved_objs, {moved_obj})
    O = paint(I, merge(moved_objs))
    return O

def togrid(obj, grid):
  canvas_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify and extract non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Transform:**  For each object:
   - Calculate the downward offset based on its height.
   - Rotate the object 90 degrees clockwise.
   - Shift the rotated object downwards using the calculated offset.
3. **Paint Objects:** Paint the transformed objects onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        rotated_obj = asobject(rot90(togrid(obj, I)))
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(rotated_obj, (height(obj), 1)))
    return O

def togrid(obj, grid):
  canvas_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract non-background objects.
2. **Iterate and Modify:**  For each object:
   - Rotate the object by 90 degrees.
   - "Cover" the original object's location with the background color.
   - Paint the rotated object at the calculated offset (downward based on height).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  transformed_objects = []
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    h = height(obj)
    transformed_objects.append(shift(asobject(rot90(togrid(obj, I))), (h, 1))) 
  output_grid = I
  for obj in transformed_objects:
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, obj)
  return output_grid

def togrid(obj, grid):
  canvas_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transform Objects:** This version first transforms all objects and stores them in a list. 
2. **Paint Transformed Objects:** It then iterates through the list of transformed objects and paints them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    h = height(obj)
    return shift(asobject(rot90(togrid(obj, I))), (h, 1))

  transformed_objects = apply(transform_object, objects(I, F, F, T))
  
  output_grid = I
  for obj in transformed_objects:
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, obj)
  return output_grid

def togrid(obj, grid):
  canvas_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `transform_object` Function:** This version defines a separate function `transform_object` for clarity and reusability.
2. **Apply Transformation:** It then uses the `apply` function to apply `transform_object` to each object.
3. **Paint Transformed Objects:** Like the previous versions, it paints the transformed objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(asobject(rot90(togrid(obj, I))), (height(obj), 1)), objects(I, F, F, T))))

def togrid(obj, grid):
  canvas_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  return paint(canvas_grid, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Lambda Function:** This version utilizes a lambda function for a more compact representation of the object transformation logic.
2. **Apply and Merge:** It applies the lambda function to all objects and then merges them for painting onto the input grid.

These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
