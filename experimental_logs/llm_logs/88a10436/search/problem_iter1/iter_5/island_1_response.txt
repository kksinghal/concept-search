## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking all the non-background objects from the input grid and moving them to the bottom-left corner of the grid, while preserving their relative positions.

**Input_0:** The objects formed by digits 1, 2, and 5 are moved to the bottom left corner, maintaining their original relative arrangement.

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the objects formed by digits 1, 2, 5, and 6 are moved to the bottom left corner while maintaining their relative positions.

**Input_2:** The objects formed by digits 2, 3, and 5 are moved to the bottom left corner, keeping their original relative arrangement.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
           canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
           merge(
             apply(
               lambda obj: shift(
                             obj,
                             (-uppermost(obj),
                              -leftmost(obj))
                           ),
               fgpartition(I)
             )
           )
         )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  This partitions the input grid `I` into objects based on their values, excluding the background color.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))), fgpartition(I))`:** This applies a lambda function to each object obtained in the previous step. The lambda function shifts each object to the bottom-left corner by calculating the negative of their uppermost and leftmost coordinates.
3. **`merge(...)`:** This merges all the shifted objects back into a single object.
4. **`paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), ...)`:**  This creates a new canvas filled with the background color of the input grid (`mostcommon(I)`) and having the same dimensions as the input (`shape(I)`). Finally, it paints the merged object onto this canvas, resulting in the desired output.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same outcome as Version 1 but uses an iterative approach. 

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid into non-background objects.
2. **`O = canvas(...)`:** Creates a blank canvas filled with the background color.
3. **`for obj in objs:...`:** Iterates through each object.
4. **`O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))))`:** For each object, calculates the shift required to move it to the bottom-left corner and paints the shifted object onto the canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
    merge({shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))) for obj in fgpartition(I)})
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes set comprehension for a more compact representation.

1. **`{shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))) for obj in fgpartition(I)}`:**  Creates a set of shifted objects by iterating over the non-background objects and shifting them to the bottom-left.
2. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the shifted objects into a single object.
3. **`paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), ...)`:** Creates the background canvas and paints the merged object onto it.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    transformed_objs = transformed_objs.union({shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj)))})
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version emphasizes immutability by using `frozenset` and its `union` method.

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Extracts non-background objects.
2. **`transformed_objs = frozenset()`:** Initializes an empty `frozenset` to store transformed objects.
3. **`for obj in objs:...`:** Iterates over each object.
4. **`transformed_objs = transformed_objs.union({...})`:** Calculates the shift and adds the shifted object to `transformed_objs` using `union`.
5. **`paint(canvas(...), merge(transformed_objs))`:**  Creates the background canvas and paints the merged, transformed objects.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    new_i = -uppermost(obj)
    new_j = -leftmost(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (new_i, new_j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version precomputes the new coordinates for clarity.

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:** Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`O = canvas(...)`:** Creates the background canvas.
3. **`for obj in fgpartition(I):...`:** Iterates over non-background objects.
4. **`new_i = -uppermost(obj)`, `new_j = -leftmost(obj)`:**  Calculates the shift values for each object.
5. **`O = paint(O, shift(obj, (new_i, new_j)))`:** Paints each shifted object onto the canvas.


These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to accomplish the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL. Each version iterates through the non-background objects, calculates the shift needed to move them to the bottom-left corner, and paints them onto a new canvas filled with the background color.
