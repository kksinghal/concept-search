## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**  Each object in the input is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then shifted down by a distance equal to its height.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:** Each object in the input is moved to the bottom of the grid while maintaining its relative horizontal position. The order of objects from left to right remains the same.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:** Each object in the input is shifted two positions to the right. 


## Program Versions & Explanations:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({asobject(shift(rot90(togrid(obj, I)), (height(obj), 0))) for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)}))
```

**Explanation:**

* **`objects(I, F, F, T)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`) treating different colors as separate objects, not considering diagonal connections, and excluding the background.
* **`for obj in objects(...)`:** Iterates through each extracted object.
* **`togrid(obj, I)`:** Converts the object back to grid format, placing it within the bounds of the original input grid.
* **`rot90(...)`:** Rotates the grid representation of the object 90 degrees clockwise.
* **`shift(..., (height(obj), 0))`:** Shifts the rotated object down by its height. 
* **`asobject(...)`:**  Converts the shifted grid representation back into an object.
* **`merge({...})`:** Combines all transformed objects into a single object set.
* **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged set of transformed objects onto the original input grid, resulting in the output grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({asobject(shift(togrid(obj, I), (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), 0))) for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)}))
```

**Explanation:**

* **`objects(I, F, F, T)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`).
* **`for obj in objects(...)`:** Iterates through each extracted object.
* **`togrid(obj, I)`:** Converts the object back to grid format.
* **`shift(..., (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), 0))`:** Calculates the downward shift needed to move the object to the bottom row. 
    * `height(I)`:  Total height of the grid.
    * `height(obj)`: Height of the object.
    * `uppermost(obj)`: Row index of the topmost cell of the object. 
* **`asobject(...)`:** Converts the shifted grid representation back into an object.
* **`merge({...})`:** Combines all transformed objects into a single object set.
* **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged set of transformed objects onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: asobject(shift(togrid(obj, I), (0, 2))), objects(I, F, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

* **`objects(I, F, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`).
* **`apply(lambda obj: ..., objects(I, F, F, T))`:** Applies the lambda function to each object.
* **`lambda obj: asobject(shift(togrid(obj, I), (0, 2)))`:** Defines an anonymous function that:
    * Converts the object to a grid (`togrid`).
    * Shifts the grid two positions to the right (`shift(..., (0, 2))`).
    * Converts the shifted grid back to an object (`asobject`).
* **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the shifted objects.
* **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({asobject(shift(togrid(obj, I), (height(obj), 0))) for obj in objects(I, F, F, T) if leftmost(obj) == 0}))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version is similar to Version 1 but includes a condition to only process objects whose leftmost point touches the left edge of the grid (`if leftmost(obj) == 0`).

**Program Version 5** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed_objects = [asobject(shift(rot90(togrid(obj, I)), (height(obj), 0))) for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)]
  return paint(I, merge(transformed_objects))
```

**Explanation:** 

* This version uses list comprehension instead of set comprehension within the `merge` function for transforming and collecting the objects. The rest of the logic remains the same as Version 1.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other valid programs you could write using the provided DSL to achieve the same transformation.  The choice of which functions to use and how to combine them is up to you.
