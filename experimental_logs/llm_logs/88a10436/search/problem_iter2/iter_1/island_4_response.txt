## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to extract the top-left quadrant of the input grid, effectively downscaling the input by a factor of 2.  Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The top-left 9x9 section of Input_0 is extracted.
* The rest of the grid is discarded.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The top-left 8x7 section of Input_1 is extracted.
* The rest of the grid is discarded.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The top-left 10x8 section of Input_2 is extracted.
* The rest of the grid is discarded.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = halve(shape(I))
    O = crop(I, ORIGIN, x1)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `shape(I)` returns the dimensions (height, width) of the input grid.
* `halve()` divides both height and width by 2, effectively calculating the dimensions of the top-left quadrant.
* `crop(I, ORIGIN, x1)` extracts the subgrid starting at the origin (0, 0) with the calculated quadrant dimensions.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = tophalf(lefthalf(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `lefthalf(I)` extracts the left half of the input grid.
* `tophalf()` extracts the top half of the resulting grid, effectively isolating the top-left quadrant.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = rot90(I)
    x2 = tophalf(x1)
    O = rot270(x2)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `rot90(I)` rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
* `tophalf(x1)` extracts the top half of the rotated grid, which now corresponds to the left half of the original.
* `rot270(x2)` rotates the extracted section back 270 degrees counter-clockwise, resulting in the desired top-left quadrant.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = downscale(I, TWO)
    O = x1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `downscale(I, TWO)` directly downscales the input grid by a factor of 2, effectively extracting every other row and column, starting from the top-left.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = shape(I)
    x2 = (x1[0] // 2 + x1[0] % 2, x1[1] // 2 + x1[1] % 2)
    x3 = canvas(ZERO, x2)
    x4 = asindices(x3)
    x5 = toobject(x4, I)
    O = paint(x3, x5)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `shape(I)` retrieves the dimensions of the input grid.
* `x2` calculates the dimensions of the output grid (top-left quadrant), accounting for odd dimensions.
* `canvas(ZERO, x2)` creates an empty canvas with the calculated dimensions filled with zeros.
* `asindices(x3)` generates all indices of the output canvas.
* `toobject(x4, I)` extracts the corresponding color values from the input grid at the generated indices.
* `paint(x3, x5)` paints the extracted object onto the output canvas.
