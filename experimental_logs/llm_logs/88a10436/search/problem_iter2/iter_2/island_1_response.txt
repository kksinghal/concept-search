## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extracting non-background objects from the input grid and arranging them vertically in a new grid. The background color is maintained, and the objects retain their original shape and color distribution. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each example:**

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** The three distinct objects (2-colored, 3-colored, and 5-colored) are extracted and stacked vertically, with the 2-colored object at the top.
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:** Similarly, the 6-colored, 1-colored, and 2-colored objects are stacked vertically. 
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:** The 2-colored and 3-colored objects are stacked, maintaining their relative positions.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), key=lambda obj: color(obj))
  height_sum = sum(height(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (height_sum, max(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  i = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (i, 0)))
    i += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all non-background objects using `objects` and sort them based on their color using `color` function.
2. **Create Canvas:** Determine the output grid's height (sum of object heights) and width (maximum object width) and create an empty canvas with the background color.
3. **Arrange Objects:** Iterate through the sorted objects, normalizing and shifting each object vertically before painting it onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (sum(height(obj) for obj in objs), max(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  i = 0
  for v in sorted(palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}):
    obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == v)
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (i, 0)))
    i += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects & Colors:** Identify all non-background objects and colors.
2. **Create Canvas:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Arrange Objects:** Iterate through the sorted colors, extract the corresponding object, normalize and shift it, and then paint it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (len(objs), max(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: color(obj))):
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (i * height(obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 2.
2. **Create Canvas:** Height is determined by the number of objects, assuming each object occupies a distinct row.
3. **Arrange Objects:** Iterate through the sorted objects, calculate the vertical shift based on object index and height, normalize, shift, and paint.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  colors = sorted(palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)})
  objs = [extract(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda obj: color(obj) == v) for v in colors]
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (sum(height(obj) for obj in objs), max(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  j = 0
  for obj in objs:
    for i, (v, (x, y)) in enumerate(sorted(obj, key=lambda cell: cell[1][1])):
      O = paint(O, {(v, (j + i, y))})
    j += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Colors & Objects:**  First, extract unique colors (excluding background). Then, extract objects matching each color. 
2. **Create Canvas:**  Similar to previous versions.
3. **Arrange Objects:**  Iterate through extracted objects. For each object, iterate through its cells sorted by column index (`y` coordinate).  Place each cell in the output grid at the calculated row (`j + i`) and original column (`y`).

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), key=lambda obj: (color(obj), -centerofmass(obj)[1]))
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (sum(height(obj) for obj in objs), max(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  i = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i - uppermost(obj), 0)))
    i += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:** Extract non-background objects. Sort them first by color, then by horizontal position (using `-centerofmass(obj)[1]`). This ensures consistent object order.
2. **Create Canvas:** Define the output canvas size based on object dimensions. Use the most common color in the input as the background.
3. **Arrange Objects:**  Iterate through the sorted objects. For each object, calculate its vertical shift to align its top edge with the current `i` position. Paint the object directly onto the canvas without normalizing. 

These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation. Each leverages different DSL functions and logic, offering a range of solutions for analysis and comparison.
