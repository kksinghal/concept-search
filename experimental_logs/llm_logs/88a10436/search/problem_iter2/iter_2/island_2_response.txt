## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the non-background object in the input grid, cropping it, rotating it either clockwise or counter-clockwise, and then placing it on a blank canvas of the appropriate size.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- The object formed by digits 1, 2, and 3 is cropped. 
- The cropped object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
- The rotated object is placed on a blank canvas of size 9x8.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The object formed by digits 1, 2, and 6 is cropped.
- The cropped object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
- The rotated object is placed on a blank canvas of size 7x7.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The object formed by digits 2 and 3 is cropped.
- The cropped object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
- The rotated object is placed on a blank canvas of size 9x8.


## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify non-empty rows and columns
  non_empty_rows = tuple(i for i, row in enumerate(I) if any(v != mostcommon(I) for v in row))
  non_empty_cols = tuple(j for j, col in enumerate(zip(*I)) if any(v != mostcommon(I) for v in col))
  
  # Crop the object
  cropped = crop(I, (min(non_empty_rows), min(non_empty_cols)), (max(non_empty_rows) - min(non_empty_rows) + 1, max(non_empty_cols) - min(non_empty_cols) + 1))
  
  # Rotate based on aspect ratio
  rotation = rot90 if height(cropped) > width(cropped) else rot270
  rotated = rotation(cropped)
  
  # Create canvas and paint
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(rotated)), asobject(rotated))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Find non-empty rows and columns by checking if any cell doesn't have the background color (most common color).
2. **Crop the object:** Use the identified rows and columns to extract the object using the `crop` function.
3. **Rotate the object:** Rotate the object 90 degrees clockwise if its height is greater than its width; otherwise, rotate it counter-clockwise using `rot90` and `rot270`.
4. **Create canvas and paint:** Create a blank canvas of the same size as the rotated object, filled with the background color. Then, paint the rotated object onto the canvas using the `paint` function.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Extract all objects
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True)

  # Find the largest object
  target_obj = argmax(objs, size)

  # Calculate the dimensions of the output grid
  out_h, out_w = width(target_obj), height(target_obj)

  # Rotate and place the object on a blank canvas
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), (out_h, out_w)), asobject(rot90(togrid(target_obj)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:**  Use the `objects` function to extract all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Find target object:** Identify the largest object based on the number of cells it occupies using the `argmax` function and `size`.
3. **Calculate output dimensions:** Determine the output grid's height and width by swapping the target object's height and width.
4. **Rotate and paint:** Rotate the target object 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90`. Create a blank canvas with the calculated dimensions and the background color. Finally, paint the rotated object onto the canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the bounding box of the non-background pixels
  non_bg_indices = toindices(objects(I, False, True, True))
  min_row, min_col = ulcorner(non_bg_indices)
  max_row, max_col = lrcorner(non_bg_indices)

  # Crop the object
  cropped_obj = crop(I, (min_row, min_col), (max_row - min_row + 1, max_col - min_col + 1))

  # Determine rotation direction based on object's dimensions
  rotation = rot90 if max_row - min_row > max_col - min_col else rot270

  # Rotate the cropped object and place it on a blank canvas
  rotated_obj = rotation(cropped_obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), (len(rotated_obj[0]), len(rotated_obj))), asobject(rotated_obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find bounding box:** Find the bounding box of non-background pixels using `objects`, `ulcorner`, and `lrcorner`.
2. **Crop the object:** Crop the object from the input grid using the bounding box coordinates.
3. **Determine rotation direction:** Determine the rotation direction based on the object's height and width.
4. **Rotate and paint:** Rotate the cropped object and then place it on a blank canvas of the appropriate size filled with the background color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find non-background pixels
  non_bg = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, mostcommon(I)))
  
  # Determine bounding box 
  min_i = min(i for i, j in non_bg)
  max_i = max(i for i, j in non_bg)
  min_j = min(j for i, j in non_bg)
  max_j = max(j for i, j in non_bg)
  
  # Crop the object
  cropped = crop(I, (min_i, min_j), (max_i - min_i + 1, max_j - min_j + 1))

  # Rotate based on aspect ratio
  if height(cropped) > width(cropped):
    rotated = rot90(cropped)
  else:
    rotated = rot270(cropped)

  # Create canvas and paint
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(rotated)), asobject(rotated))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find non-background pixels:** Identify indices of non-background pixels using `difference` and `ofcolor`.
2. **Determine bounding box:** Calculate bounding box coordinates from the non-background indices.
3. **Crop the object:** Crop the object using the calculated bounding box.
4. **Rotate the object:** Choose rotation direction based on the cropped object's aspect ratio.
5. **Create canvas and paint:** Generate a canvas with the background color and paint the rotated object onto it.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify the object using objects function with without_bg set to True
  obj = first(objects(I, False, True, True))

  # Calculate dimensions of the rotated object
  new_height, new_width = width(obj), height(obj)

  # Determine the rotation direction based on the object's dimensions
  if new_height > new_width:
    rotated_obj = rot90(togrid(obj))
  else:
    rotated_obj = rot270(togrid(obj))
  
  # Paint the rotated object onto a blank canvas
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), (new_height, new_width)), asobject(rotated_obj)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Use the `objects` function with `without_bg` set to True to extract the non-background object.
2. **Calculate dimensions:** Determine the output dimensions by swapping the object's height and width.
3. **Determine rotation and rotate:** Choose the rotation direction based on the dimensions and rotate the object accordingly.
4. **Paint on canvas:** Create a blank canvas with the background color and paint the rotated object onto it.
