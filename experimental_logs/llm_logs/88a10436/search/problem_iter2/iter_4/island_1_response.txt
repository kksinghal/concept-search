## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation takes each object from the input grid and stacks them vertically in the output grid, maintaining their original width and relative position. The objects are ordered based on their appearance in the input, starting from the top row and going left to right.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The same vertical stacking logic is applied here. The objects are ordered from left to right, top to bottom, based on their appearance in the input grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  Again, the objects are stacked vertically, maintaining their width. The ordering is similar to Input_0, starting from the top row and moving left to right. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct code versions, drawing inspiration from the provided programs A and B, aiming for a score of 0:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), key=lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)))
  height_sum = 0
  for obj in objs:
    height_sum += height(obj)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (height_sum, max(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  i = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i - uppermost(obj), 0)))
    i += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:**  We identify objects in the input grid `I` using `objects`, similar to program A. However, we sort them based on their upper-left corner position `(uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))`, ensuring correct ordering.
2. **Calculate Canvas Height:**  We sum the heights of all extracted objects to determine the required height of the output canvas.
3. **Create Canvas:** We create a blank canvas `O` with the calculated height and the maximum width among the objects, filled with the background color from the input.
4. **Vertical Stacking:** We iterate through the sorted objects and paint them onto the canvas. Each object is shifted vertically using `shift` to its correct position based on the accumulated height (`i`) and its original uppermost coordinate.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (len(I), max(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  j = 0
  for i in range(len(I)):
    row_objs = sorted(filter(lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == i, objs), key=lambda obj: leftmost(obj))
    for obj in row_objs:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (j, 0)))
      j += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to version 1, we extract objects from the input grid.
2. **Create Canvas:** We create a canvas with the same height as the input grid and maximum object width.
3. **Iterate and Stack:** We iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, we find objects starting at that row and sort them by their leftmost position.  We then paint them onto the canvas, shifting them vertically based on the accumulated height (`j`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  max_width = max(width(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (sum(height(obj) for obj in objs), max_width))
  current_height = 0
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if (I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)):
        obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj))
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (current_height - uppermost(obj), 0)))
        current_height += height(obj)
        break 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Max Width:** Extract objects and find the maximum object width.
2. **Create Canvas:** Create a canvas with calculated height based on object heights and maximum width.
3. **Iterate, Find and Stack:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid. When a non-background cell is encountered, find the corresponding object and paint it on the canvas, adjusting its vertical position. Then, break the inner loop to avoid stacking multiple objects from the same row at the same vertical position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  max_height = max(height(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (max_height, sum(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  current_width = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (0, current_width)))
    current_width += width(obj)
  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Max Height:** Extract objects and find the maximum object height.
2. **Create Canvas:** Create a canvas with maximum object height and a width calculated from the sum of object widths.
3. **Horizontal Stacking:** Stack objects horizontally based on their encounter order.
4. **Rotate:** Rotate the canvas by 90 degrees counter-clockwise to achieve vertical stacking.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  max_width = max(width(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (sum(height(obj) for obj in objs), max_width))
  y = 0
  for obj in sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))):
    obj_height = height(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (y, 0)))
    y += obj_height
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Max Width:**  Extract objects and find the maximum width among them.
2. **Create Canvas:** Create a blank canvas with a height equal to the sum of all object heights and a width equal to the maximum object width, filled with the background color of the input.
3. **Vertical Stacking:** Iterate through the sorted objects. For each object, calculate its height. Paint the object onto the canvas, shifting it vertically (`y` coordinate) based on the accumulated height.

These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation while utilizing functions from the DSL. Each version prioritizes different aspects like sorting, canvas creation, object placement, and grid manipulation to achieve the final result.
