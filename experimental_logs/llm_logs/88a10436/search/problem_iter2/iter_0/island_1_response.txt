## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each unique non-background color in the input grid:**
1. **Identify the object** formed by all cells of that color.
2. **Calculate the bounding box** that fully encloses the object.
3. **Crop the bounding box** from the input grid.
4. **Place the cropped bounding box** at the top left corner of the output grid.

This effectively extracts each unique non-background object from the input grid and places them individually in the top left corner of the output grid.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I), width(I)))
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (i, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize the output grid:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I), width(I)))` creates an output grid 'O' of the same size as input 'I' filled with the background color.
2. **Extract non-background objects:**  `objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies and stores all objects formed by non-background colors in a set 'objs'.
3. **Iterate through objects:** `for i, obj in enumerate(objs):` iterates through each extracted object and its index 'i'.
4. **Normalize, shift, and paint:** For each object:
    - `normalize(obj)` moves the object to the top left corner (0,0).
    - `shift(normalize(obj), (i, 0))` shifts the normalized object to the right by 'i' positions.
    - `paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (i, 0)))` paints the shifted object onto the output grid 'O'.
5. **Return the output grid:** `return O` returns the final transformed grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, value in enumerate(palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}):
    obj = extract(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda obj: color(obj) == value)
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (i, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version takes a slightly different approach by iterating over unique non-background colors instead of directly iterating over objects:

1. **Initialize output grid:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate over unique colors:** `for i, value in enumerate(palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}):` iterates through each unique non-background color and its index 'i'.
3. **Extract object of specific color:**  `obj = extract(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda obj: color(obj) == value)` extracts the object corresponding to the current color 'value'.
4. **Normalize, shift, and paint:**  Same logic as Version 1.
5. **Return output grid:** Same as Version 1.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    j = 0
    for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        O = paint(O, shift(normalize(recolor(v, ofcolor(I, v))), (j, 0)))
        j += 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on directly manipulating indices corresponding to each color:

1. **Initialize output grid:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate over unique colors:**  Similar to Version 2, it iterates over unique non-background colors.
3. **Find indices of the color:** `ofcolor(I, v)` retrieves the indices of all cells with the current color 'v'.
4. **Create a single-colored object:** `recolor(v, ofcolor(I, v))` generates a new object with all cells having the same color 'v' at the retrieved indices.
5. **Normalize, shift, and paint:** Similar to Version 1, it normalizes, shifts by an increasing offset 'j', and paints the single-colored object onto the output grid.
6. **Return output grid:** Same as Version 1.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = sorted(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), key=lambda obj: -centerofmass(obj)[1])
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
        O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (i, 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version introduces sorting of objects based on their horizontal position before placing them on the output grid:

1. **Extract and sort objects:**
   - `objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` extracts all non-background objects from the input grid.
   - `sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: -centerofmass(obj)[1])` sorts the extracted objects based on the horizontal component (column index) of their center of mass in descending order (from right to left).
2. **Initialize output grid:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Iterate through sorted objects:** Similar to Version 1, it iterates over each object and its index 'i'.
4. **Normalize, shift, and paint:** Similar to Version 1, it normalizes, shifts, and paints each object onto the output grid.
5. **Return output grid:** Same as Version 1.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (max(height(obj) for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)), width(I)))
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    j = 0
    for obj in objs:
        O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (j,0)))
        j += height(obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version adjusts the height of the output grid to accommodate all objects without overlapping:

1. **Determine maximum object height:** `max(height(obj) for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))` calculates the maximum height among all objects in the input grid.
2. **Initialize output grid with adjusted height:**  `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (max_height, width(I)))` creates the output grid 'O' with a height equal to 'max_height' and the same width as the input grid.
3. **Extract non-background objects:**  Same as Version 1.
4. **Iterate through objects:**  Similar to Version 1, it iterates through each object.
5. **Normalize, shift, and paint:** 
   - It normalizes and shifts each object to the right by an increasing offset 'j'.
   -  The offset 'j' is incremented by the height of the current object to prevent overlapping.
6. **Return output grid:** Same as Version 1.
