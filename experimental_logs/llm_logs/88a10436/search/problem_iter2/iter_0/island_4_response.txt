## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the smallest object:** Find the object on the input grid with the fewest cells.
2. **Determine the dimensions of this object:** Calculate the height and width of the smallest object.
3. **Create a new grid:** Construct a new grid with dimensions equal to the height and width of the smallest object.
4. **Transfer the smallest object to the new grid:**  Copy the smallest object from its original position on the input grid to the new grid, placing it in the top-left corner. 
5. **No background fill:** Unlike Program_A, the transformation does *not* fill the background of the new grid with any specific value. The remaining cells in the new grid should remain as 0 (the default canvas value). 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input 0:** The smallest object is the shape formed by the '1' and '3' digits. Its dimensions are 3 rows x 3 columns. The output grid is a 3x3 grid with this object transferred to the top left. 
* **Input 1:** The smallest object is the shape formed by the '6' digits. Its dimensions are 4 rows x 2 columns. The output grid is a 4x2 grid with this object transferred to the top left.
* **Input 2:** The smallest object is the shape formed by the '3' and '1' digits. Its dimensions are 4 rows x 4 columns. The output grid is a 4x4 grid with this object transferred to the top left.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  min_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  dims = shape(min_obj)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, dims), normalize(min_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`: Extract all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. `min_obj = argmin(objs, size)`: Find the object with the smallest size.
3. `dims = shape(min_obj)`: Get the height and width of the smallest object.
4. `O = paint(canvas(ZERO, dims), normalize(min_obj))`: Create a new canvas with the dimensions of the smallest object and paint the normalized smallest object onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  min_size = valmin(objs, size)
  filtered_objs = sizefilter(objs, min_size)
  min_obj = first(filtered_objs)
  O = subgrid(min_obj, I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`: Extract all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. `min_size = valmin(objs, size)`: Find the size of the smallest object.
3. `filtered_objs = sizefilter(objs, min_size)`: Filter objects to keep only those with the smallest size.
4. `min_obj = first(filtered_objs)`: Select the first object from the filtered set (any object with the smallest size will work).
5. `O = subgrid(min_obj, I)`: Extract the subgrid containing the smallest object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  min_obj = extract(objs, lambda x: size(x) == valmin(objs, size))
  h, w = height(min_obj), width(min_obj)
  O = crop(I, ulcorner(min_obj), (h, w))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`: Extract all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. `min_obj = extract(objs, lambda x: size(x) == valmin(objs, size))`: Extract the first object whose size is equal to the minimum object size.
3. `h, w = height(min_obj), width(min_obj)`: Get the height and width of the extracted object.
4. `O = crop(I, ulcorner(min_obj), (h, w))`: Crop the input grid around the smallest object based on its dimensions and upper-left corner.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  min_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  h, w = shape(min_obj)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), shift(min_obj, (-uppermost(min_obj), -leftmost(min_obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = fgpartition(I)`: Partition the input grid into objects, excluding the background.
2. `min_obj = argmin(objs, size)`: Find the smallest object.
3. `h, w = shape(min_obj)`: Get the height and width of the smallest object.
4. `O = paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), shift(min_obj, (-uppermost(min_obj), -leftmost(min_obj))))`: Create a canvas, then shift the smallest object so its upper-left corner is at the origin, and paint it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  min_area = valmin(objs, lambda x: height(x) * width(x))
  min_obj = extract(objs, lambda x: height(x) * width(x) == min_area)
  h, w = height(min_obj), width(min_obj)
  O = crop(I, ulcorner(min_obj), (h, w))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`: Extract all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. `min_area = valmin(objs, lambda x: height(x) * width(x))`: Calculate the minimum area among all objects.
3. `min_obj = extract(objs, lambda x: height(x) * width(x) == min_area)`: Find the first object with the minimum area.
4. `h, w = height(min_obj), width(min_obj)`: Get the height and width of the object.
5. `O = crop(I, ulcorner(min_obj), (h, w))`: Crop the input grid based on the dimensions and upper-left corner of the object with the minimum area.
