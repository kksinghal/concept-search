## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation takes the right half of the input grid, mirrors it vertically, and then pastes it onto the right side of the top half of the original input grid. The bottom half of the output grid is empty.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The transformation takes the right half of the input grid and rotates it 90 degrees counter-clockwise. This rotated half is then pasted onto the right side of the top half of the original input grid. Again, the bottom half of the output grid is empty.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** This transformation isolates the non-background objects from the input grid and shifts them upwards. The objects maintain their relative horizontal positions but are now clustered at the top of the grid. The bottom half of the output grid remains empty.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = lefthalf(I)
  x2 = righthalf(I)
  x3 = vmirror(x2) if even(len(I)) else rot270(x2)
  O = vconcat(hconcat(x1, x3), canvas(0, (height(x1), width(I))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1 = lefthalf(I):**  Extracts the left half of the input grid `I`.
2. **x2 = righthalf(I):** Extracts the right half of the input grid `I`.
3. **x3 = vmirror(x2) if even(len(I)) else rot270(x2):** If the input grid has an even number of rows (like Input_0 and Input_2), vertically mirror the right half (`x2`). If the input grid has an odd number of rows (like Input_1), rotate the right half 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
4. **O = vconcat(hconcat(x1, x3), canvas(0, (height(x1), width(I))))):** Concatenate the left half (`x1`) and the transformed right half (`x3`) horizontally. Then, concatenate a blank canvas with the same width as the input grid and half the height below it to create the final output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = lefthalf(I)
    x2 = righthalf(I)
    x3 = branch(even(len(I)), vmirror(x2), rot270(x2))
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(hconcat(x1, x3)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1 = lefthalf(I):** Extracts the left half of the input grid `I`.
2. **x2 = righthalf(I):** Extracts the right half of the input grid `I`.
3. **x3 = branch(even(len(I)), vmirror(x2), rot270(x2)):** This uses the `branch` function to apply different transformations based on the height of the input grid. If the height is even, the right half is mirrored vertically; if odd, it's rotated 270 degrees.
4. **O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(hconcat(x1, x3))):** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, then paints the horizontally concatenated left half (`x1`) and transformed right half (`x3`) onto it. 

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    x2 = branch(even(len(I)), apply(vmirror, x1), apply(rot270, x1))
    x3 = merge(x2)
    x4 = ulcorner(x3)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (height(I) // 2, width(I))), shift(x3, (-x4[0], 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1 = objects(I, T, F, T):** Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **x2 = branch(even(len(I)), apply(vmirror, x1), apply(rot270, x1)):** Applies either `vmirror` or `rot270` to each extracted object based on whether the input grid height is even or odd.
3. **x3 = merge(x2):** Merges the transformed objects back into a single object.
4. **x4 = ulcorner(x3):** Finds the upper-left corner of the merged object.
5. **O = paint(canvas(0, (height(I) // 2, width(I))), shift(x3, (-x4[0], 0))):** Creates a blank canvas with half the height of the input grid, and then paints the merged object onto it after shifting it upwards to align with the top of the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    x2 =  [(vmirror(obj) if even(len(I)) else rot270(obj)) for obj in x1]
    x3 = merge(x2)
    x4 = ulcorner(x3)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (height(I) // 2, width(I))), shift(x3, (-x4[0], 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1 = objects(I, T, F, T):** Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **x2 =  [(vmirror(obj) if even(len(I)) else rot270(obj)) for obj in x1]:** Uses list comprehension to apply either `vmirror` or `rot270` to each extracted object based on whether the input grid height is even or odd.
3. **x3 = merge(x2):** Merges the transformed objects back into a single object.
4. **x4 = ulcorner(x3):** Finds the upper-left corner of the merged object.
5. **O = paint(canvas(0, (height(I) // 2, width(I))), shift(x3, (-x4[0], 0))):** Creates a blank canvas with half the height of the input grid, and then paints the merged object onto it after shifting it upwards to align with the top of the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:** 

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    transformed_objs = frozenset(vmirror(obj) if even(len(I)) else rot270(obj) for obj in objs)
    top_half = paint(canvas(0, (height(I) // 2, width(I))), merge(transformed_objs))
    return top_half
```

**Explanation:**

1. **objs = objects(I, T, F, T):** Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **transformed_objs = frozenset(vmirror(obj) if even(len(I)) else rot270(obj) for obj in objs):** Creates a new set of objects, applying either `vmirror` or `rot270` to each extracted object based on whether the input grid height is even or odd.
3. **top_half = paint(canvas(0, (height(I) // 2, width(I))), merge(transformed_objs)):** Creates a blank canvas with half the height of the input grid and paints the merged transformed objects onto it.
4. **return top_half:** Returns the canvas with transformed objects, representing the top half of the output.
