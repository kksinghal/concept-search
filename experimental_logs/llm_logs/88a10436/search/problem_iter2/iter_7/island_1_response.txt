## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples can be described as **cropping the input grid to the smallest bounding box containing all non-background objects**. 

* **Example 0:** The input grid has three objects (2, 1, 5). The output grid is cropped to a 9x9 grid containing all three objects.
* **Example 1:** The input grid has four objects (6, 1, 2, 5). The output grid is cropped to an 8x7 grid containing all four objects.
* **Example 2:**  The input grid has four objects (5, 2, 3, 1). The output grid is cropped to a 10x8 grid containing all four objects. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  min_i = min(uppermost(obj) for obj in objs)
  max_i = max(lowermost(obj) for obj in objs)
  min_j = min(leftmost(obj) for obj in objs)
  max_j = max(rightmost(obj) for obj in objs)
  return crop(I, (min_i, min_j), (max_i - min_i + 1, max_j - min_j + 1)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects` function to find all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Bounding Box:** Calculates the minimum and maximum row (`min_i`, `max_i`) and column (`min_j`, `max_j`) indices of all objects.
3. **Crop Grid:** Uses the calculated bounding box coordinates to crop the input grid `I` using the `crop` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = merge(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))
  return subgrid(objs, I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Merge:** Uses `objects` to find all non-background objects, then merges them into a single patch using `merge`.
2. **Extract Subgrid:**  Uses the `subgrid` function with the merged patch and input grid to extract the smallest subgrid containing all objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  all_indices = asindices(I)
  bg_indices = ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I))
  object_indices = all_indices - bg_indices
  return subgrid(object_indices, I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get All and Background Indices:** Uses `asindices` and `ofcolor` to find indices of all cells and background cells, respectively.
2. **Calculate Object Indices:**  Subtracts background indices from all indices to obtain indices of object cells.
3. **Extract Subgrid:** Uses `subgrid` with the object indices and input grid to get the cropped grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  cropped = I
  while len(set(cropped[0])) == 1: 
    cropped = cropped[1:]
  while len(set(cropped[-1])) == 1:
    cropped = cropped[:-1]
  cropped = rot90(cropped)
  while len(set(cropped[0])) == 1:
    cropped = cropped[1:]
  while len(set(cropped[-1])) == 1:
    cropped = cropped[:-1]
  return rot270(cropped)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Trim Top and Bottom:** Iteratively removes rows from the top and bottom of the grid if they consist only of the background color.
2. **Rotate and Repeat:** Rotates the grid 90 degrees and repeats step 1, effectively trimming the left and right sides.
3. **Rotate Back:** Rotates the grid back to its original orientation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  rows = tuple(i for i, row in enumerate(I) if any(v != bg for v in row))
  cols = tuple(j for j, col in enumerate(dmirror(I)) if any(v != bg for v in col))
  return crop(I, (min(rows), min(cols)), (max(rows) - min(rows) + 1, max(cols) - min(cols) + 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Non-Background Rows and Columns:** Identifies rows and columns containing at least one non-background cell.
2. **Calculate Bounding Box:** Determines the minimum and maximum row and column indices from the identified rows and columns.
3. **Crop Grid:** Uses the calculated bounding box to crop the input grid using `crop`.

These five programs represent distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each program leverages different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL for solving this spatial reasoning task.
