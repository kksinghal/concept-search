## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** The transformation crops the input grid to the smallest bounding box containing any non-zero values.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**  Similar to the first transformation, it crops to the bounding box of non-zero values. However, the resulting grid is transposed (rows become columns and vice versa).

**Input 2 -> Output 2:** This transformation crops the input grid to a 10x8 grid starting from the top-left corner.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions to achieve the described transformations:

**Version 1:** (Cropping to bounding box)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  min_i = min(uppermost(obj) for obj in objs)
  max_i = max(lowermost(obj) for obj in objs)
  min_j = min(leftmost(obj) for obj in objs)
  max_j = max(rightmost(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = crop(I, (min_i, min_j), (max_i - min_i + 1, max_j - min_j + 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find non-zero objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all connected components of non-zero values in the grid.
2. **Find bounding box:** We calculate the `min_i`, `max_i`, `min_j`, and `max_j` values representing the top-left and bottom-right corners of the smallest bounding box containing all non-zero objects.
3. **Crop the grid:**  `crop(I, (min_i, min_j), (max_i - min_i + 1, max_j - min_j + 1))` extracts the subgrid defined by the calculated bounding box.

**Version 2:** (Cropping to bounding box and transposing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  min_i = min(uppermost(obj) for obj in objs)
  max_i = max(lowermost(obj) for obj in objs)
  min_j = min(leftmost(obj) for obj in objs)
  max_j = max(rightmost(obj) for obj in objs)
  cropped = crop(I, (min_i, min_j), (max_i - min_i + 1, max_j - min_j + 1))
  O = rot90(cropped)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Steps 1-3:** Identical to Version 1, cropping the grid to the bounding box.
2. **Transpose the grid:** `rot90(cropped)` rotates the cropped grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise, effectively transposing it.

**Version 3:** (Fixed size cropping)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = crop(I, (0, 0), (10, 8))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Crop the grid:** This version directly uses `crop(I, (0, 0), (10, 8))` to extract a fixed 10x8 grid from the top-left corner of the input.

**Version 4:** (Using object manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(obj)), normalize(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the first non-zero object:** `first(objects(I, T, F, T))` extracts the first connected component of non-zero values.
2. **Create an empty canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(obj))` creates a grid filled with zeros, having the same dimensions as the extracted object.
3. **Normalize and paint:** `normalize(obj)` moves the object's upper-left corner to the origin, and `paint` draws it onto the canvas. This effectively crops to the object's bounding box.

**Version 5:** (Iterative cropping)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  while any(v != 0 for v in O[0]):
    O = trim(O)
  while any(v != 0 for v in O[-1]):
    O = trim(rot180(O))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize with input:**  `O = I` sets the output to the input initially.
2. **Trim top and bottom:** The `while` loops iteratively trim the top and bottom rows of the grid as long as they contain non-zero values. `rot180` is used to trim the bottom by rotating the grid, trimming the top, and rotating back.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the observed transformations using the provided DSL functions. They offer varying levels of flexibility and efficiency, highlighting the richness of the DSL and the potential for diverse solutions in this problem space.
