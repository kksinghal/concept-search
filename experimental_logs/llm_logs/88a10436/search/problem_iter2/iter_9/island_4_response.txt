## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the top-left quadrant of the input grid and placing it in the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid. The output grid is initially filled with zeros.

**Input 0:**

* The top-left quadrant (9x9) is extracted.
* A 9x9 canvas of zeros is created.
* The extracted quadrant is painted onto the canvas, resulting in the output grid.

**Input 1:**

* The top-left quadrant (7x7) is extracted.
* A 7x7 canvas of zeros is created.
* The extracted quadrant is painted onto the canvas, resulting in the output grid.

**Input 2:**

* The top-left quadrant (10x8) is extracted.
* A 10x8 canvas of zeros is created.
* The extracted quadrant is painted onto the canvas, resulting in the output grid.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  tl = crop(I, (0, 0), (h // 2, w // 2)) # Extract top-left quadrant
  O = canvas(0, (h // 2, w // 2)) # Create canvas for the quadrant
  O = paint(O, toobject(asindices(tl), tl)) # Paint quadrant onto the canvas
  O = hconcat(canvas(0, (h // 2, w // 2)), O) # Concatenate with zeros on the left
  O = vconcat(canvas(0, (h // 2, w // 2)), O) # Concatenate with zeros on top
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract quadrant:**  The top-left quadrant `tl` is extracted using `crop`,  `h // 2`, and `w // 2`  to determine its dimensions.
2.  **Create canvas:** A canvas `O` of zeros is created with the same dimensions as the extracted quadrant using `canvas`.
3.  **Paint quadrant:** The extracted quadrant `tl` is converted to an object and painted onto the canvas `O` using `toobject`, `asindices`, and `paint`.
4.  **Concatenate with zeros:** The canvas `O` is concatenated with canvases of zeros on the left and top using `hconcat` and `vconcat` to position the quadrant in the bottom-right.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I) // 2
  w = width(I) // 2
  O = canvas(0, (h * 2, w * 2)) # Create a zero-filled canvas of double the size
  O = paint(O, toobject(shift(asindices(crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w))), (h, w)), crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w)))) # Directly paint shifted quadrant
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate quadrant dimensions:** `h` and `w` are calculated for the quadrant.
2. **Create canvas:** A canvas `O` of zeros is created with double the size of the quadrant.
3. **Paint shifted quadrant:** The top-left quadrant is extracted, its indices are shifted down and right by `(h, w)`, converted to an object with the quadrant's values, and painted directly onto the canvas `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w)) # Create a zero-filled canvas
  for i in range(h // 2):
    for j in range(w // 2):
      O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i + h // 2, j + w // 2))},) # Paint each cell from top-left to bottom-right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create canvas:** A canvas `O` of zeros is created with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate and paint:** The program iterates through each cell in the top-left quadrant and paints the corresponding cell in the bottom-right quadrant of the canvas `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), toobject(shift(asindices(crop(I, (0, 0), halve(shape(I)))), halve(shape(I))), crop(I, (0, 0), halve(shape(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic into a single line:

1.  **Create canvas:** A zero-filled canvas is created using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
2.  **Extract and shift:** The top-left quadrant is extracted using `crop` and `halve(shape(I))`  and its indices are shifted using `shift` and `halve(shape(I))`.
3.  **Paint:** The shifted indices are converted to an object with corresponding values from the extracted quadrant and then painted onto the canvas using `paint` and `toobject`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  return vconcat(hconcat(canvas(0, (h, w)), canvas(0, (h, w))), hconcat(canvas(0, (h, w)), crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate quadrant dimensions:** `h` and `w` represent the height and width of a quadrant.
2.  **Construct quadrants:** Four quadrants are constructed: three zero-filled canvases and the top-left quadrant of the input using `canvas` and `crop`.
3.  **Concatenate:** The quadrants are concatenated together using `hconcat` and `vconcat` to place the extracted quadrant in the bottom-right position. 

This approach avoids explicit iteration and object conversion, focusing on grid manipulation.
