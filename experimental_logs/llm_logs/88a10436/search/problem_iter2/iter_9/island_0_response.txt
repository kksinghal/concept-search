## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves extracting a rectangular region from the input grid and cropping it. The region is defined by the uppermost and leftmost non-zero values, extending downwards and rightwards until the next zero value.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the first transformation, a rectangular region is extracted. However, this region is rotated 90 degrees clockwise before being cropped.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** This transformation also extracts a rectangular region and crops it, similar to the first transformation.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  obj = max(objs, key=size)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj)
  O = crop(O, ulcorner(obj)[::-1], shape(obj)[::-1])
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, False, False, True)`**: Identify all distinct objects (connected components) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **`obj = max(objs, key=size)`**: Select the largest object based on its size.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj)`**: Create a canvas filled with zeros the same size as the input grid and paint the largest object onto it.
4. **`O = crop(O, ulcorner(obj)[::-1], shape(obj)[::-1])`**: Crop the canvas to the bounding box of the largest object. The `[::-1]` reverses the coordinates to address the row-column order.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  non_zeros = [(i,j) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v != 0]
  min_i = min(i for i, j in non_zeros)
  min_j = min(j for i, j in non_zeros)
  max_i = max(i for i, j in non_zeros)
  max_j = max(j for i, j in non_zeros)
  return crop(I, (min_i, min_j), (max_i - min_i + 1, max_j - min_j + 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`non_zeros = ...`**: Find all indices of non-zero values in the grid.
2. **`min_i = ...`, `min_j = ...`, `max_i = ...`, `max_j = ...`**:  Calculate the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the non-zero values, defining the bounding box.
3. **`return crop(I, (min_i, min_j), (max_i - min_i + 1, max_j - min_j + 1))`**: Crop the input grid to the calculated bounding box.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  obj = max(partition(I), key=len)
  return crop(I, ulcorner(obj)[::-1], shape(obj)[::-1])
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = max(partition(I), key=len)`**: Partition the grid into objects based on connected components, considering all values, and select the largest one.
2. **`return crop(I, ulcorner(obj)[::-1], shape(obj)[::-1])`**:  Crop the grid to the bounding box of the largest object, similar to Version 1. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  mask = [[v != 0 for v in row] for row in I]
  obj = max(objects(mask, True, False, False), key=len)
  return crop(I, ulcorner(obj)[::-1], shape(obj)[::-1])
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mask = [[v != 0 for v in row] for row in I]`**: Create a boolean mask grid where `True` represents non-zero values and `False` represents zero values in the input grid.
2. **`obj = max(objects(mask, True, False, False), key=len)`**: Find connected components (objects) in the mask grid, treating all `True` values as the same, and select the largest object.
3. **`return crop(I, ulcorner(obj)[::-1], shape(obj)[::-1])`**: Crop the original input grid based on the bounding box of the largest object found in the mask grid. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  rows = [i for i, row in enumerate(I) if any(v != 0 for v in row)]
  cols = [j for j, col in enumerate(dmirror(I)) if any(v != 0 for v in col)]
  return crop(I, (min(rows), min(cols)), (max(rows) - min(rows) + 1, max(cols) - min(cols) + 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rows = ...`**: Find all row indices that contain at least one non-zero value.
2. **`cols = ...`**: Find all column indices that contain at least one non-zero value by applying `dmirror` (diagonal mirror) to the grid and then checking for non-zero values in each row (which now represent columns). 
3. **`return crop(I, (min(rows), min(cols)), (max(rows) - min(rows) + 1, max(cols) - min(cols) + 1))`**: Crop the input grid using the minimum and maximum row and column indices to define the bounding box.
