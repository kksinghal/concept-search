## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves rotating the top-left quadrant of the input grid either 90 degrees counter-clockwise or vertically mirroring it, depending on whether the input grid's height is even or odd. This transformed quadrant is then cropped to form the output.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The height is even (18). So, the top-left quadrant is vertically mirrored and then cropped to produce Output_0.
* **Input_1:** The height is even (16). Thus, the top-left quadrant is vertically mirrored and then cropped, resulting in Output_1.
* **Input_2:** The height is even (20). Hence, the top-left quadrant undergoes vertical mirroring and cropping to obtain Output_2. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program utilizing the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  quadrant = crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2)) # Extract top-left quadrant
  transformed_quadrant = branch(even(height(I)), vmirror(quadrant), rot270(quadrant)) # Transform based on height
  return crop(transformed_quadrant, (0, 0), (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2)) # Crop to output size
```

**Explanation:**

1. `crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2))`: Extracts the top-left quadrant of the input grid.
2. `branch(even(height(I)), vmirror(quadrant), rot270(quadrant))`: Conditionally applies either `vmirror` (vertical mirroring) if the height is even or `rot270` (270-degree counter-clockwise rotation) if the height is odd to the extracted quadrant.
3. `crop(transformed_quadrant, (0, 0), (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2))`: Crops the transformed quadrant to the desired output size (half the height and half the width of the input).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return crop(branch(even(height(I)), vmirror(I), rot270(I)), (0, 0), (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2))
```

**Explanation:**

This version streamlines the process by combining the transformation and cropping into a single `branch` statement. It first conditionally transforms the entire input grid and then crops the result to obtain the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  h = height(I) // 2
  w = width(I) // 2
  return crop(branch(even(height(I)), vmirror, rot270)(crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w))), (0, 0), (h, w))
```

**Explanation:**

Version 3 pre-calculates the output dimensions and applies the conditional transformation to the pre-cropped quadrant. This improves efficiency by minimizing operations on the larger input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  transformed_grid = branch(even(height(I)), lambda x: vmirror(x), lambda x: rot270(x))(I)
  return crop(transformed_grid, (0,0), (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages lambda functions within the `branch` statement to apply the transformations. This approach enhances readability by separating the conditional logic from the function calls.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return crop(apply(lambda row: row if even(height(I)) else row[::-1], rot270(I)), (0, 0), (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2))
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a different approach by first rotating the grid 270 degrees. Then, it uses `apply` to conditionally reverse each row of the rotated grid based on the input grid's height. Finally, it crops the result to get the output.

These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation using the DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided function set.
