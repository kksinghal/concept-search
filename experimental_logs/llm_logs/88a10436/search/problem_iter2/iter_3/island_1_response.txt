## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves extracting the three non-background objects from the input grid and stacking them vertically in order of their color values (ascending). Each object is normalized (shifted to the top-left corner) before stacking.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, this also involves vertically stacking non-background objects sorted by color. However, here the objects are stacked based on the horizontal position of their leftmost cells (from left to right).

**Input_2 to Output_2:** This transformation extracts non-background objects and positions them in the output grid while maintaining their relative vertical positions from the input grid. The objects are placed from left to right based on the vertical position of their topmost cells (top to bottom). 


## Program_to_be_generated:

### **Program Version 1:**

**Code:**
```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), key=lambda obj: (color(obj), uppermost(obj)))
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (max(height(obj) for obj in objs), sum(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  j = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (0, j)))
    j += width(obj)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:** It extracts non-background objects and sorts them based on color and then uppermost row index for tie-breaking.
2. **Create Canvas:** It creates an output canvas with height equal to the maximum height of the objects and width equal to the sum of their widths.
3. **Stack Objects:** It iterates through the sorted objects, normalizes and shifts them horizontally before painting them onto the canvas.


### **Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), key=lambda obj: leftmost(obj))
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (sum(height(obj) for obj in objs), max(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  i = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (i, 0)))
    i += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:** It extracts non-background objects and sorts them based on the column index of their leftmost cells.
2. **Create Canvas:** It creates an output canvas with height equal to the sum of object heights and width equal to the maximum object width.
3. **Stack Objects:** It iterates through the sorted objects, normalizes and shifts them vertically before painting onto the canvas.


### **Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I), width(I)))
  j = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, j - leftmost(obj))))
    j += width(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:**  It extracts non-background objects and sorts them based on the row index of their topmost cells.
2. **Create Canvas:** It creates an output canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Position Objects:** It iterates through the sorted objects, shifts them horizontally based on their leftmost cell's column index, and paints them onto the canvas.

### **Program Version 4:**

**Code:**
```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (max(height(obj) for obj in objs), sum(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  j = 0
  for obj in objs:
    normalized_obj = normalize(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(normalized_obj, (0, j)))
    j += width(normalized_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Extract non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Create Canvas:** Generate an output canvas with height as the maximum height of the objects and width as the sum of their widths.
3. **Normalize and Position Objects:** Iterate through each object, normalize it (shifting its top-left corner to (0, 0)), and then shift it horizontally on the canvas based on the accumulated width of previous objects.

### **Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (sum(height(obj) for obj in objs), max(width(obj) for obj in objs)))
  i = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i - uppermost(obj), 0)))
    i += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Extract all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Create Canvas:** Create an output canvas with a height equal to the total height of all objects and a width equal to the maximum width among all objects.
3. **Position and Paint Objects:** Iterate through each object, shift it vertically based on the accumulated height of previous objects, and paint it onto the canvas.
