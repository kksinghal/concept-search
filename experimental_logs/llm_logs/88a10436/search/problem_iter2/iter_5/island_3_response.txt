## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes the top-left quadrant of the input grid and mirrors it to the right side, resulting in a grid with half the width of the original.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. The top-left 9x9 section of Input_0 is mirrored to the right, discarding the original right half.
2. The bottom half of the grid is discarded.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. The top-left 8x7 section of Input_1 is mirrored to the right, discarding the original right half.
2. The bottom half of the grid is discarded.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

1. The top-left 10x8 section of Input_2 is mirrored to the right, discarding the original right half.
2. The bottom half of the grid is discarded.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(I[i][:len(I[0])//2] + I[i][:len(I[0])//2][::-1] for i in range(len(I)//2))
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly manipulates the input grid `I`:

1. It iterates through the rows of the top half of the grid (`range(len(I)//2)`).
2. For each row `i`, it takes the left half (`I[i][:len(I[0])//2]`) and concatenates it with a reversed copy of itself (`I[i][:len(I[0])//2][::-1]`).
3. This creates the mirrored effect, discarding the original right half.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return crop(hconcat(lefthalf(I), hmirror(lefthalf(I))), (0, 0), (height(I) // 2, width(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes existing DSL functions:

1. `lefthalf(I)` extracts the left half of the input grid.
2. `hmirror(lefthalf(I))` creates a horizontally mirrored copy of the left half.
3. `hconcat` concatenates the original and mirrored left halves horizontally.
4. `crop` is used to select the top half of the concatenated grid, effectively discarding the bottom half and achieving the final output.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(r[:len(r)//2] + r[:len(r)//2][::-1] for r in I[:len(I)//2])
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on row-wise manipulation:

1. It iterates through each row `r` in the top half of the input grid (`I[:len(I)//2]`).
2. For each row, it takes the left half (`r[:len(r)//2]`) and concatenates it with a reversed copy of itself (`r[:len(r)//2][::-1]`).
3. This mirrored row is then added to the output grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    half_height = height(I) // 2
    half_width = width(I) // 2
    return tuple(tuple(I[i][j] if j < half_width else I[i][2*half_width-j-1] for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(half_height))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested loops and conditional replacement:

1. It calculates `half_height` and `half_width` for efficient access.
2. It iterates through each cell in the top half (`range(half_height)`) and full width (`range(width(I))`) of the grid.
3. For each cell `(i, j)`, it keeps the original value if it's in the left half (`j < half_width`).
4. If the cell is in the right half, it mirrors the corresponding cell from the left half using `I[i][2*half_width-j-1]`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return vconcat(hconcat(downscale(lefthalf(I),2), downscale(hmirror(lefthalf(I)),2)), canvas(0, (height(I)//2, width(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes downscaling and canvas creation:

1. It extracts the left half of the input grid using `lefthalf(I)`.
2. It creates a horizontally mirrored copy of the left half using `hmirror(lefthalf(I))`.
3. Both halves are downscaled by a factor of 2 using `downscale(..., 2)`.
4. These downscaled halves are concatenated horizontally using `hconcat`.
5. A canvas of zeros is created with the desired output dimensions using `canvas(0, (height(I)//2, width(I)))`.
6. Finally, the concatenated halves are vertically concatenated with the zero canvas using `vconcat` to achieve the final output.


Each of these versions utilizes different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the DSL.
