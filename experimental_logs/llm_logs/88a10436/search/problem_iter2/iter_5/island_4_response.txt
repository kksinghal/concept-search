## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to extract the top-left quadrant of the input grid, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, and then place it on the left side of the original grid, effectively squashing the original right side.

**Input_0:**

1. The top-left quadrant (8x9) is extracted:
```
0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

2. This quadrant is rotated 90 degrees clockwise:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0
```

3. The rotated quadrant is placed on the left side of the original grid, overwriting the existing elements:
```
0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

The same logic applies to **Input_1** and **Input_2**.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h = height(I) // 2
    w = width(I) // 2
    x1 = crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w))
    x2 = rot90(x1)
    x3 = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
    x4 = hconcat(x2, x3)
    O = vconcat(x4, crop(I, (h, 0), (h, w)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate half the height (`h`) and half the width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. Extract the top-left quadrant using `crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w))` and store it in `x1`.
3. Rotate `x1` 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90(x1)` and store it in `x2`.
4. Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the quadrant, filled with the most common color of the input grid (`mostcolor(I)`) using `canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))` and store it in `x3`.
5. Concatenate `x2` and `x3` horizontally using `hconcat(x2, x3)` to get the top half of the output grid and store it in `x4`.
6. Extract the bottom half of the original input grid using `crop(I, (h, 0), (h, w))`.
7. Concatenate `x4` (modified top half) and the extracted bottom half vertically using `vconcat` to get the final output grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = rot90(I)
  x2 = tophalf(x1)
  x3 = hconcat(x2, canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(x2)))
  O = rot270(x3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Rotate the input grid (`I`) 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90(I)` and store it in `x1`.
2. Extract the top half of the rotated grid using `tophalf(x1)` and store it in `x2`.
3. Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as `x2`, filled with the most common color of the input grid (`mostcolor(I)`) using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(x2))`.
4. Concatenate `x2` and the created canvas horizontally using `hconcat(x2, canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(x2)))` to form the modified grid and store it in `x3`.
5. Rotate `x3` 270 degrees clockwise (equivalent to rotating the original grid 180 degrees) using `rot270(x3)` to get the final output grid `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, False, False, True)
  x2 = lambda x: ulcorner(x)[1] < width(I) // 2
  x3 = sfilter(x1, x2)
  x4 = mapply(lambda x: shift(rot90(toobject(x, I)), (0, width(I) // 2)), x3)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), x4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify all objects in the input grid (`I`) using `objects(I, False, False, True)` and store them in `x1`. This function identifies connected components (objects) based on non-background color.
2. Define a lambda function `x2` which checks if the upper-left corner of an object is located in the left half of the grid.
3. Filter the objects in `x1` based on the condition defined by `x2` using `sfilter(x1, x2)` and store the filtered objects in `x3`. This selects objects located in the left half.
4. For each object in `x3`, apply a transformation:
    - Convert the object to a grid representation using `toobject(x, I)`.
    - Rotate the object 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90`.
    - Shift the rotated object to the right by half the grid width using `shift(..., (0, width(I) // 2))`.
5. Paint the transformed objects onto a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`), filled with the most common color of `I` using `paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), x4)`. This creates the final output grid `O`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h = height(I) // 2
    w = width(I) // 2
    x1 = crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w))
    x2 = rot90(x1)
    x3 = hconcat(x2, [[mostcolor(I) for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)])
    O = vconcat(x3, crop(I, (h, 0), (h, w)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Similar to version 1, calculate half the height (`h`) and half the width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. Extract the top-left quadrant using `crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w))` and store it in `x1`.
3. Rotate `x1` 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90(x1)` and store it in `x2`.
4. Create a grid of the same dimensions as the quadrant filled with the most common color of `I` using list comprehension instead of the `canvas` function: `[[mostcolor(I) for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]`.
5. Concatenate `x2` and the newly created grid horizontally using `hconcat(x2, ...)` and store the result in `x3`.
6. Extract the bottom half of the original input grid using `crop(I, (h, 0), (h, w))`.
7. Concatenate `x3` (modified top half) and the extracted bottom half vertically using `vconcat` to get the final output grid `O`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  w = width(I)
  x1 = lefthalf(I)
  x2 = rot90(x1)
  O = hconcat(x2, canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(x2), w - width(x2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Get the width of the input grid (`I`) using `width(I)` and store it in `w`.
2. Extract the left half of the input grid using `lefthalf(I)` and store it in `x1`.
3. Rotate `x1` 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90(x1)` and store it in `x2`.
4. Create a blank canvas with the height of `x2` and the width equal to the remaining width of the original grid (`w - width(x2)`), filled with the most common color of `I` using `canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(x2), w - width(x2)))`.
5. Concatenate `x2` (rotated left half) and the newly created canvas horizontally using `hconcat(x2, ...)` to form the final output grid `O`.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various functions and logic within the provided DSL. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for manipulating grids and objects.
