## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying each distinct object (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid and moving them downwards by a distance equal to their height. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The object '2 2\n0 1' is moved down 2 units (its height), the object '1' is moved down 1 unit, and so on.
* **Input_1:**  The object '6' is moved down 1 unit, the object '1 1' is moved down 1 unit, and the object '2 2 2' is moved down 1 unit.
* **Input_2:** The object '2 2' is moved down 2 units, the objects '3 1' and '3 3 1' are each moved down 3 units, and the object '5' is moved down 1 unit.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fold(lambda acc, obj: paint(acc, shift(obj, (height(obj), 0))), objects(I, F, F, T), I) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, F, F, T)`:** Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`lambda acc, obj: paint(acc, shift(obj, (height(obj), 0)))`:**  This anonymous function takes an accumulator grid (`acc`) and an object (`obj`) as input. It shifts the object downwards by its height and paints it onto the accumulator grid.
3. **`fold(..., objects(I, F, F, T), I)`:**  The `fold` function (assuming it's a higher-order function available in your DSL) iterates over the objects extracted in step 1. For each object, it applies the anonymous function from step 2, using the input grid `I` as the initial accumulator. This effectively paints each shifted object onto the input grid, resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(obj), 0)), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`:** Extracts non-background objects from the grid.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(obj), 0)), objs)`:**  Applies the shifting operation to each extracted object.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the shifted objects back into a single object set.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged, shifted objects onto the input grid `I` to produce the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, multiply(shape(obj), (1, 0))), objects(I, F, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, F, F, T)`:** Extracts the non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **`lambda obj: shift(obj, multiply(shape(obj), (1, 0)))`:**  For each object, it calculates its shape (height, width) using `shape(obj)`, multiplies the shape with  `(1, 0)` to get a tuple representing the downward shift amount, and then uses `shift` to perform the downward shift. 
3. **`apply(..., objects(I, F, F, T))`:**  Applies the shifting function to each object extracted in step 1.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the shifted objects back together.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged, shifted objects onto the original input grid `I` to get the final output. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,  merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(obj), leftmost(obj) - leftmost(obj))), objects(I, F, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, F, F, T)`:**  Extracts the non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(obj), leftmost(obj) - leftmost(obj)))`:** This anonymous function takes an object `obj` and calculates the amount to shift it downwards. The `leftmost(obj) - leftmost(obj)` part always evaluates to 0, ensuring no horizontal shift.
3. **`apply(..., objects(I, F, F, T))`:**  This applies the shifting operation to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the shifted objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** This takes the original grid `I` and paints the merged, shifted objects onto it, generating the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def shift_object(obj):
        h = height(obj)
        return shift(obj, (h, 0))  
    shifted_objects = apply(shift_object, objects(I, F, F, T))
    return fold(lambda grid, obj: paint(grid, obj), shifted_objects, I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def shift_object(obj): ...`:** Defines a helper function `shift_object` that takes an object, calculates its height (`h`), and shifts the object downwards by `h` units.
2. **`shifted_objects = apply(shift_object, objects(I, F, F, T))`:** Extracts non-background objects from the grid and applies the `shift_object` function to each, storing the results in `shifted_objects`.
3. **`return fold(lambda grid, obj: paint(grid, obj), shifted_objects, I)`:**  Uses `fold` to iterate over the `shifted_objects` and paint each object onto a copy of the input grid `I`, effectively combining all shifted objects onto one grid.
