## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the input grid and reflecting objects along a vertical line that passes through the center of their bounding box.  The background color remains unchanged.

**Example:**

Let's illustrate using Input_1 and its corresponding Output_1.

**Input_1:**

```
0 0 0 0 6 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 2 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

**Output_1:**

```
0 0 0 0 6 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 2 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

Notice how the object consisting of '6's, '1's, and '2's is reflected along a vertical line passing through its center. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """ 
  Reflects objects in the input grid along a vertical line through their center.
  """
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) 
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    center_j = (left + right) // 2 
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      target_j = center_j + (center_j - j)
      O = fill(O, v, (i, target_j)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code first identifies all distinct objects in the input grid (`I`) using the `objects` function. It excludes the background.
2. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas (`O`) of the same size and background color as the input grid is created.
3. **Iterate and Reflect:** The code iterates through each identified object (`obj`). 
   - For each object, it calculates the horizontal center (`center_j`) of its bounding box.
   - For each cell (`i`, `j`) within the object, a target column index (`target_j`) is calculated by mirroring the cell's column position relative to `center_j`.
   - The corresponding cell in the output canvas (`O`) is filled with the object's color (`v`) at the mirrored location (`i`, `target_j`).
4. **Return Output:** The transformed canvas is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Reflects objects about their vertical center line.
  """
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for x, (i, j) in obj:
      O = fill(O, x, (i, 2 * centerofmass(obj)[1] - j))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  Creates a blank canvas `O` with the background color and size of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:**  Identifies and iterates through each non-background object in the grid using `objects`.
3. **Reflect Each Cell:**  For every cell (`i`, `j`) with color `x` in an object:
    - Computes the object's center of mass using `centerofmass(obj)`.
    - Calculates the mirrored column index `2 * centerofmass(obj)[1] - j`.
    - Fills the corresponding cell in the output canvas `O` with color `x` at the mirrored location.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the transformed canvas `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """ 
  Reflects each object in the grid horizontally around its center.
  """
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), hmirror(shift(obj, (0, -leftmost(obj) - width(obj) // 2)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Starts with the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** Iterates through all the non-background objects in the grid using `objects`.
3. **Reflect and Paint Each Object:** For each object:
   -  Erases the object from the output grid `O` using `cover(O, obj)`.
   -  Shifts the object so its left edge aligns with the y-axis using `shift(obj, (0, -leftmost(obj)))`.
   -  Mirrors the shifted object horizontally using `hmirror`.
   -  Paints the mirrored object back onto the output grid `O` using `paint`.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Reflects each object horizontally based on its bounding box.
  """
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      O = fill(O, v, (i, 2*(leftmost(obj) + width(obj)//2) - j))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:**  A blank canvas `O` is created, matching the background color and dimensions of the input grid `I`.
2. **Process Each Object:** It iterates over each object (excluding background) in the input grid.
3. **Reflect Cells:** For each cell (`i`, `j`) with value `v` in the object:
    - It determines the horizontal midpoint of the object's bounding box using `leftmost(obj) + width(obj)//2`.
    - The reflection of the cell's column index `j` is calculated as `2*(midpoint) - j`.
    - This mirrored cell is filled with the original value `v` on the canvas `O`.
4. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified canvas `O` containing the reflected objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """ 
  Reflects objects along their vertical axis within their bounding box. 
  """
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    box_indices = backdrop(obj)
    for i, j in box_indices:
      if (index(I, (i,j)) != mostcolor(I)):
        v = index(I, (i,j))
        center_j = leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2
        target_j = center_j + (center_j - j)
        O = fill(O, v, (i, target_j))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code first identifies distinct objects in the input grid (`I`) excluding the background.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** It creates an empty canvas (`O`) with the same background color and dimensions as `I`.
3. **Iterate Through Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object. 
   - For each object, it determines its bounding box indices using `backdrop(obj)`.
   - It then iterates through each cell within the bounding box. 
4. **Reflect and Fill:**  For every non-background cell within the bounding box:
     - It calculates the horizontal center (`center_j`) of the object's bounding box.
     - A mirrored column index (`target_j`) is calculated relative to `center_j`. 
     - The cell at (`i`, `target_j`) on the output canvas (`O`) is filled with the corresponding color (`v`) from the input grid.
5. **Return Output:** The transformed canvas `O` is returned.
