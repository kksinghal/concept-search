## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves mirroring non-background objects in the input grid along a vertical axis. This axis isn't the middle of the grid, but rather seems to be determined by the rightmost object in the grid. 

**Example Breakdowns:**

* **Input 0:** The rightmost object (digit '1') is in column 3. Objects are mirrored as if column 2 is the axis.
* **Input 1:** The rightmost object (digit '2') is in column 6. Objects are mirrored as if column 5 is the axis.
* **Input 2:** The rightmost object (digit '1') is in column 6. Objects are mirrored as if column 5 is the axis.

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1: Using `rightmost` and object manipulation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  rm = rightmost(merge(objs)) - 1  # Find the mirroring axis
  mirrored_objs = mapply(
      lambda obj: shift(hmirror(shift(obj, (0, -rm))), (0, rm)), objs
  )
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), mirrored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the axis:** Calculate the mirroring axis by finding the rightmost column of any non-background object (`rightmost(merge(objs))`) and subtracting 1.
2. **Mirror objects:** 
    * Shift each object leftwards so that the mirroring axis aligns with the y-axis.
    * Horizontally mirror the object.
    * Shift the mirrored object back to the right by the same amount.
3. **Paint:** Paint the mirrored objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.

**Version 2:  Iterating through columns and mirroring**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for j in range(w):
    for i in range(h):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        rm = rightmost(asobject(I)) - 1  # Mirroring axis
        mirror_j = rm - (j - rm) 
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, mirror_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output:** Create a blank canvas for the output.
2. **Iterate and mirror:** Loop through each cell in the input grid.
   * If the cell is not background, calculate its mirrored column index (`mirror_j`).
   * Paint the cell's value at the mirrored location on the output grid.

**Version 3: Splitting the grid and mirroring**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  rm = rightmost(asobject(I))
  left_part = crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I), rm)) 
  right_part = hmirror(left_part)
  return hconcat(left_part, right_part)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the splitting point:** Determine the column index (`rm`) for splitting based on the rightmost non-background cell.
2. **Split and mirror:** 
    * Extract the left portion of the grid up to the splitting point.
    * Horizontally mirror the left portion to create the right portion.
3. **Concatenate:** Combine the left and right portions to form the output grid.

**Version 4: Using `hfrontier` and mirroring based on frontier**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  frontiers_set = frontiers(I)
  rightmost_frontier = argmax(frontiers_set, lambda f: rightmost(f))
  rm = rightmost(rightmost_frontier) - 1  # Mirroring axis
  mirrored_objs = mapply(
      lambda obj: shift(hmirror(shift(obj, (0, -rm))), (0, rm)), fgpartition(I)
  )
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), mirrored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find rightmost frontier:** Identify all frontiers in the grid and select the one with the highest column index (rightmost).
2. **Determine mirroring axis:** Calculate the axis based on the rightmost frontier's column position.
3. **Mirror objects:** Similar to Version 1, mirror each non-background object using the identified axis.

**Version 5: Recursive mirroring based on object presence**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  def mirror_recursive(grid, col):
    if col < 0:
      return grid
    for i in range(h):
      if index(grid, (i, col)) != mostcolor(grid): 
        mirror_col = 2 * (rightmost(asobject(grid)) - 1) - col 
        O = paint(O, {(index(grid, (i, col)), (i, mirror_col))})
    return mirror_recursive(grid, col - 1)
  return mirror_recursive(I, w-1)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output:** Create a blank canvas for the output.
2. **Recursive mirroring:** 
   * Define a recursive function `mirror_recursive` that iterates through columns from right to left.
   * For each non-background cell, calculate its mirrored column and paint it on the output grid.
   * Recursively call the function for the next leftward column.

These are five distinct versions of the program utilizing different logic and DSL functions to achieve the same mirroring transformation. Each version offers a unique approach to solving the problem, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL.
