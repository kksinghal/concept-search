## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be **sliding non-background objects to the left**, eliminating empty columns and effectively "compressing" the grid horizontally. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The object formed by digits '1', '2', and '3' has slid left, filling the empty columns.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* Similar to Input_0, the object consisting of digits '1', '2', and '6' has moved left, removing empty columns.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* Again, the objects formed by digits '2' and '3', respectively, have shifted leftward, compressing the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True) # Identify all non-background objects
  g = I
  for obj in objs:
    g = paint(cover(g, obj), shift(obj, (-leftmost(obj), 0))) # Shift each object to the leftmost column
  O = compress(g) # Remove empty columns to compress the grid
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, False, True, True)` identifies all non-background objects in the input grid.
2. **Shift Left:**  For each object, it's erased from the grid (`cover(g, obj)`) and then repainted at a new location (`paint`) shifted to the leftmost column using `shift(obj, (-leftmost(obj), 0))`.
3. **Compress Grid:** Finally, `compress(g)` removes any empty columns, effectively "compressing" the grid horizontally.

**Program Version 2:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  g = I
  w = width(I)
  for j in range(w):  # Iterate over columns from left to right
    if len(set(g[i][j] for i in range(height(g)))) == 1 and index(g,(0,j)) == mostcommon(g): 
        # Check if the column is empty (contains only background color)
      g = tuple(tuple(row[1:]) for row in g)  # Remove the empty column
  O = g
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Columns:** It iterates through each column of the grid from left to right.
2. **Check for Empty Column:**  For each column, it checks if it contains only the background color.
3. **Remove Empty Column:** If a column is empty, it's removed by slicing the grid.

**Program Version 3:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True)  # Extract non-background objects
  new_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (-leftmost(I), 0)) for obj in objs)  # Shift objects left
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs)) # Paint shifted objects onto a blank canvas 
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to previous versions, it extracts non-background objects.
2. **Shift Objects:** It shifts all objects to the left edge of the grid using `shift(obj, (-leftmost(I), 0))`.
3. **Paint on Blank Canvas:** It creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid filled with the background color and paints the shifted objects onto it.

**Program Version 4:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  g = I
  for i in range(width(g)):
    g = hconcat(compress(g), canvas(mostcolor(g), (height(g), 1)))  # Compress and add a blank column
    g = trim(g) # Remove the rightmost column
  O = g
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate and Compress:**  It iterates, compressing the grid in each step.
2. **Add Blank Column:** After compression, it adds a blank column to the right.
3. **Trim Grid:** It then removes the rightmost column. This effectively shifts content to the left.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  compressed_grid = compress(I)  # Compress the grid first
  O = hconcat(compressed_grid, canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I), width(I) - width(compressed_grid)))) 
  # Concatenate with a blank canvas to restore original width
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Compress First:** This version directly compresses the input grid.
2. **Calculate Missing Width:** It calculates the difference in width between the original and compressed grids.
3. **Concatenate with Blank Canvas:** It then concatenates the compressed grid with a blank canvas of the calculated width, effectively padding the grid to the original size. 

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same outcome, using a variety of DSL functions and logic. This demonstrates the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial transformation tasks.
