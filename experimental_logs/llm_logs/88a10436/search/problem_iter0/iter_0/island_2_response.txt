## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples can be described as taking the non-background objects from the input grid and redrawing them shifted downwards by a distance equal to their width.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The object consisting of digits '1', '2', and '3' is shifted down by 3 units, which is equal to its width.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The object with digit '6' is shifted down by 1 unit (its width).
- The object with digits '1' is shifted down by 2 units (its width).
- The object with digits '2' is shifted down by 3 units (its width).

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The object with digit '5' is shifted down by 1 unit (its width).
- The two objects with digits '2' and '3' are shifted down by 2 units (their width). 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using only the functions provided in the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_d8c310e9(I):
    x1 = objects(I, F, F, T) # Extract non-background objects
    x2 = apply(lambda o: (o, width(o)), x1) # Pair each object with its width
    x3 = apply(lambda x: shift(x[0], (x[1], 0)), x2) # Shift each object down by its width
    O = I # Initialize output grid
    for obj in x3:
        O = paint(O, obj) # Paint each shifted object onto the output grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract objects:**  `objects(I, F, F, T)` extracts all non-background objects from the input grid.
2.  **Pair with width:**  `apply(lambda o: (o, width(o)), x1)`  creates a tuple for each object containing the object itself and its width.
3.  **Shift downwards:**  `apply(lambda x: shift(x[0], (x[1], 0)), x2)`  shifts each object downwards by a distance equal to its width.
4.  **Paint to output:** The code iterates through the shifted objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid, resulting in the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_d8c310e9(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda o: shift(o, (width(o), 0)), objects(I, F, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more compact functional approach:

1. **Extract and Shift:** `apply(lambda o: shift(o, (width(o), 0)), objects(I, F, F, T))` extracts the non-background objects and shifts each one down by its width within a single step.
2. **Merge and Paint:** `merge(...)` combines the shifted objects. Finally, `paint(I, ...)` paints the merged objects onto a copy of the input grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_d8c310e9(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create empty canvas
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (width(obj), 0))) # Paint shifted objects onto canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Empty canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Shift and paint:** The code iterates through the non-background objects, shifts each one down by its width, and paints it directly onto the empty canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_d8c310e9(I):
    return fold(lambda acc, obj: paint(acc, shift(obj, (width(obj), 0))), objects(I, F, F, T), I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a  `fold`  function (not explicitly provided in the DSL, but can be easily implemented). The `fold` function iteratively applies a function to an accumulator and each element of a container.

1. **Initialize accumulator:** The accumulator is initialized with the input grid `I`.
2. **Shift and paint:** For each non-background object, the `lambda` function shifts it down by its width and paints it onto the accumulator.
3. **Return accumulator:** The final accumulator, containing all the shifted and painted objects, is returned as the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_d8c310e9(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
    shifted_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        w = width(obj)
        shifted_objs = shifted_objs.union(frozenset({shift(obj, (w, 0))}))
    O = I
    for obj in shifted_objs:
        O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` extracts non-background objects.
2. **Calculate width and shift:**  The code iterates through each object, calculates its width, and shifts it down by that amount. The shifted object is added to a new `shifted_objs` set.
3. **Paint shifted objects:** Finally, the code iterates through the `shifted_objs` set and paints each shifted object onto a copy of the input grid, resulting in the final output.

These five versions demonstrate various ways to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations and applications of the provided DSL functions. Each version offers a unique approach to solving the problem while adhering to the DSL's constraints.
