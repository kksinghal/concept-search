## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in each input-output pair involves mirroring the non-background objects in the grid along a vertical axis of symmetry located in the center of the grid.  

**Input_0:**

* The object composed of digits '1', '2', and '3' is mirrored vertically.
* The object composed of the digit '5' remains unchanged as it lies on the axis of symmetry.

**Input_1:**

* The object composed of digits '1' and '2' is mirrored vertically.
* The object composed of the digit '5' remains unchanged as it lies on the axis of symmetry.
* The single '6' digit acts as a single-element object and is also mirrored.

**Input_2:**

* The objects composed of digits '1', '2', and '3' are mirrored vertically.
* The object composed of the digit '5' remains unchanged as it lies on the axis of symmetry.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  w = width(I)
  mirrored_objs = frozenset({
    frozenset({
        (v, (i, w - 1 - j)) if j > w // 2 else (v, (i, j)) 
        for v, (i, j) in obj
    })
    for obj in objs
  })
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), mirrored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Center:** `width(I)` retrieves the width of the grid to determine the vertical axis of symmetry.
3. **Mirror Objects:** For each object, iterate over its cells. If a cell's column index `j` is greater than half the grid's width (`w // 2`), its mirrored column index is calculated as `w - 1 - j`. Otherwise, the cell remains unchanged. 
4. **Construct Output:**  Create a blank canvas using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`, and paint the mirrored objects onto it using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  w = width(I)
  mirrored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(hmirror(shift(obj, (0, -w // 2))), (0, w // 2)), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), mirrored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate Center:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Mirror Objects:** This version utilizes function composition for a more concise approach. For each object:
   - Shift the object horizontally to align its vertical axis with the grid's y-axis (`shift(obj, (0, -w // 2))`).
   - Mirror the shifted object horizontally using `hmirror`.
   - Shift the mirrored object back to its original horizontal position (`shift(..., (0, w // 2))`).
4. **Construct Output:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    w = width(I)
    O = tuple(
        tuple(
            I[i][w - 1 - j] if j > w // 2 else I[i][j] 
            for j in range(w)
        ) 
        for i in range(height(I))
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Center:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Mirror Grid:** This version directly manipulates the grid instead of individual objects.  Iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell's column index `j` is greater than half the grid's width (`w // 2`), its mirrored value is retrieved from `I[i][w - 1 - j]`. Otherwise, the original cell value is kept.
3. **Construct Output:** The mirrored grid is directly returned as the output. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  w = width(I)
  mirrored_objs = frozenset({
      frozenset({
          (v, (i, 2 * (w // 2) - j)) if j > w // 2 else (v, (i, j))
          for v, (i, j) in obj
      })
      for obj in objs
  })
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), mirrored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate Center:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Mirror Objects:** Similar to Version 1, but uses a slightly different formula to calculate the mirrored column index: `2 * (w // 2) - j`.  This leverages the fact that `2 * (w // 2)` is equivalent to `w` when `w` is even and `w - 1` when `w` is odd.
4. **Construct Output:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    w = width(I)
    left = crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I), w // 2 + w % 2))
    right = crop(I, (0, w // 2), (height(I), w // 2))
    O = hconcat(left, hmirror(right))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Center:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Split and Mirror:** This version splits the grid into left and right halves along the axis of symmetry. The left half remains unchanged, while the right half is mirrored horizontally.
3. **Construct Output:**  The mirrored right half is horizontally concatenated with the left half to create the output grid.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same vertical mirroring transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and programming paradigms.
