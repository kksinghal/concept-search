## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves mirroring the top left quadrant of the input grid to the bottom left, and mirroring just the top right object of the top left quadrant to the bottom right of the output grid. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* **Top Left Quadrant:** Contains objects "2 2", "1", and "3".
* **Transformation:**  The bottom left quadrant becomes a mirrored copy of this (objects "2 2", "1", "3"). The bottom right gets a mirrored copy of the "2" object from the top right.

**Input_1:**

* **Top Left Quadrant:** Contains objects "0" and "5".
* **Transformation:** The bottom left quadrant is mirrored with objects "0" and "5".  The bottom right remains unchanged as the top right of the top left quadrant contains only background.

**Input_2:**

* **Top Left Quadrant:** Contains only background "0".
* **Transformation:** The bottom left and bottom right quadrants remain unchanged as the top left quadrant is empty (except for background).

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with explanations:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  tl = crop(I, (0, 0), (h//2, w//2))  # Top left quadrant
  tr_obj = toobject(crop(I, (0, w//2), (h//2, w//2)), I) # Top Right Object
  mirrored_tl = hmirror(vmirror(tl)) # Mirrored top left
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)), toobject(tl, I)) # Paint top left
  O = paint(O, toobject(crop(I, (h//2, 0), (h//2, w//2)), I), (h//2, 0)) # Paint bottom left
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(vmirror(tr_obj)), (h//2, w//2))) # Paint mirrored quadrant
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Quadrants:** The program starts by calculating the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`). Then, it extracts the top left quadrant (`tl`) using `crop`.
2. **Mirror Top Left:** The top left quadrant is mirrored both horizontally and vertically using `hmirror` and `vmirror`, resulting in `mirrored_tl`.
3. **Create Canvas:** A new canvas (`O`) is created with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the most common color in the input (assumed to be the background).
4. **Paint Quadrants:** The program then paints the `tl`, `mirrored_tl` (bottom left), and a shifted `hmirror(vmirror(tr_obj))` (mirrored top right object) onto the canvas at their corresponding positions using `paint`.

**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  objs = objects(crop(I, (0, 0), (h//2, w//2)), univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False) # Extract objects from the top left quadrant
  bottom_left_objs = frozenset({shift(hmirror(vmirror(obj)), (h//2, 0)) for obj in objs}) # Mirror objects to the bottom left
  top_right_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj) >= w//2) # Find the top right object
  bottom_right_obj = shift(hmirror(vmirror(top_right_obj)), (h//2, w//2)) # Mirror top right object to the bottom right
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)), objs) # Paint top left objects
  O = paint(O, bottom_left_objs) # Paint bottom left objects
  O = paint(O, bottom_right_obj) # Paint bottom right object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** This version utilizes the `objects` function to directly extract objects from the top left quadrant of the input.
2. **Mirror and Position:** The extracted objects are then mirrored and shifted to their correct positions in the bottom left and bottom right quadrants.
3. **Paint Objects:** Finally, the original and transformed objects are painted onto a blank canvas to generate the output.

**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)), asobject(crop(I, (0, 0), (h//2, w//2))))
  for i in range(h // 2):
    for j in range(w):
      if j < w // 2 or index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (h - i - 1, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Paint Top Left and Initialize:** This version paints the entire top left quadrant directly onto the output canvas (`O`) and uses it as the base for further modification.
2. **Conditional Mirroring:** It iterates through the top half of the grid and selectively mirrors cells to the bottom half. Cells in the top left quadrant or non-background cells in the top right quadrant are mirrored.

**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  tl = crop(I, (0, 0), (h//2, w//2))
  O = hconcat(vconcat(tl, hmirror(vmirror(tl))), vconcat(tl, hmirror(vmirror(crop(I, (0, w // 2), (1, 1))))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Mirror:**  This version focuses on conciseness. It extracts the top left quadrant (`tl`) and creates mirrored versions using `hmirror` and `vmirror`.
2. **Concatenate and Construct:** It then uses `hconcat` and `vconcat` to directly construct the output grid by concatenating the original and mirrored quadrants. 
   - It reuses the `tl` for the bottom left quadrant, as it's the same as the mirrored top left. 
   - For the bottom right, it mirrors only the top right cell of the input (`(0, w//2)`) to replicate just the top right object.

**Version 5** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = I  # Start with the original grid
  for i in range(h // 2):
    for j in range(w):
      if j < w // 2 or index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (h - i - 1, j))}) # Mirror specific cells
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **In-Place Modification:** This version modifies the input grid (`I`) directly to produce the output (`O`).
2. **Selective Mirroring:** It iterates through each cell in the top half and mirrors it to the bottom half if:
   - The cell is in the top left quadrant.
   - The cell is in the top right quadrant AND is not a background color.

Each of these versions leverages different DSL functions and strategies to achieve the same transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving visual reasoning tasks.
