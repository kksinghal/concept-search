## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** Each object is shifted down by 4 rows if the object size is greater than 2, otherwise shifted down by 3 rows. After the vertical shift, each object is also shifted to the right by a number of columns equal to its width minus 1. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Each object is shifted down by a number of rows equal to its height.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Each object is shifted up by 4 rows.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    h = height(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    if size(obj) > 1:
      I = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(obj, (4 + (size(obj) > 2) - uppermost(obj), w - 1 - leftmost(obj))))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:**  The code iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate shift:** Calculates the vertical shift (4 rows + 1 if the size is greater than 2) and horizontal shift (width - 1).
3. **Shift and paint:** Removes the original object (`cover`), then paints it back at the new location determined by the calculated shift. 

This version leverages the object-based manipulation seen in Program_B but incorporates conditional vertical shifting based on object size like Program_A.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge(shift(obj, (4 + (size(obj) > 2) - uppermost(obj), width(obj) - 1 - leftmost(obj))) for obj in objects(I, False, True, True) if size(obj) > 1)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Generates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **Calculate shifts & merge:**  Calculates the shift for each object and merges them into a single object.
3. **Paint onto canvas:**  Paints the merged object, which now incorporates the shifts, onto the blank canvas.

This version takes inspiration from Program_A's conditional shifting but avoids iterative painting by calculating all shifts first and then performing a single paint operation.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fold(
      lambda acc, obj: paint(
          acc, 
          shift(obj, (4 + (size(obj) > 2) - uppermost(extract(objects(acc, False, True, True), lambda o: color(o) == color(obj))), width(obj) - 1 - leftmost(extract(objects(acc, False, True, True), lambda o: color(o) == color(obj)))))
      ),
      objects(I, False, True, True),
      cover(I, merge(objects(I, False, True, True)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:**  Starts with a blank canvas by removing all objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate and paint:** Iterates over each object in the original input and paints them onto the canvas with the calculated shifts.

This version introduces the use of `fold` function to iteratively build the output grid. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    h = height(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    if size(obj) > 1:
      shifted_objs.add(shift(obj, (4 + (size(obj) > 2) - uppermost(obj), w - 1 - leftmost(obj))))
  return paint(cover(I, merge(objects(I, False, True, True))), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty set:**  Initializes an empty set to store shifted objects.
2. **Calculate shifts & store:** Calculates the shifts for each object and adds the shifted objects to the set.
3. **Paint onto canvas:** Clears the original grid and paints all shifted objects from the set onto the grid.

This version separates the shift calculation and painting steps for clarity and efficiency. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
      merge([shift(obj, (4 + (size(obj) > 2) - uppermost(obj), width(obj) - 1 - leftmost(obj))) for obj in objects(I, False, True, True) if size(obj) > 1])
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input.
2. **Calculate shifts & merge:** Computes shifts for each object and merges them into a single object.
3. **Paint merged object:** Paints the combined shifted object onto the blank canvas.

This version streamlines the code by using list comprehension for calculating shifts and merging objects before painting them onto the canvas in one step. 


Each of these versions uses a different combination of DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired output, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
