## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves reflecting the top-right quadrant of the input grid across its vertical midline and pasting it onto the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is identical to the input grid.

**Input 0:**
- The top-right quadrant (2x2) containing digits '1' and '3' is reflected. 
- This reflected quadrant is then pasted onto the bottom-left quadrant (2x2) of the output grid.

**Input 1:**
- The top-right quadrant (2x3) containing digits '6', '1', '2' is reflected.
- This reflected quadrant is then pasted onto the bottom-left quadrant (2x3) of the output grid.

**Input 2:**
- The top-right quadrant (3x4) containing digits '2', '3', '5' is reflected.
- This reflected quadrant is then pasted onto the bottom-left quadrant (3x4) of the output grid.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)) # Create an empty canvas
  for i in range(h // 2): # Iterate over rows of the top half 
    for j in range(w // 2, w): # Iterate over columns of the right half
      val = index(I, (i, j)) # Get the value at the current location
      O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))}) # Paint the value at the original location
      O = paint(O, {(val, (h - i - 1, j))}) # Paint the value at the mirrored location
  for i in range(h // 2, h): # Iterate over rows of the bottom half
    for j in range(w // 2): # Iterate over columns of the left half
      val = index(I, (i, j))
      O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates a canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with the most frequent color in the input grid.
2. **Top-Right Quadrant Handling:** Iterates through each cell in the top-right quadrant of the input grid. For each cell, it paints the corresponding cells on both the original location and the mirrored location in the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid.
3. **Bottom-Left Quadrant Handling:** Iterates through each cell in the bottom-left quadrant of the input grid and paints the corresponding cell in the output grid. This ensures the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid remains identical to the input.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  top_right = crop(I, (0, w), (h, w)) # Extract the top-right quadrant
  bottom_left =  rot180(hmirror(top_right)) # Mirror and rotate the quadrant
  O = hconcat(crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w)), top_right) # Construct the top half of the output grid
  O = vconcat(O, hconcat(bottom_left, crop(I, (h, 0), (h, w)))) # Construct the complete output grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Quadrant Extraction:** Extracts the top-right quadrant from the input grid using `crop`.
2. **Mirroring and Rotation:** Mirrors the extracted quadrant horizontally and then rotates it by 180 degrees using `hmirror` and `rot180`.
3. **Output Grid Construction:** Constructs the output grid by concatenating the appropriate quadrants:
    - Top half: Concatenates the top-left quadrant of the input grid with the original top-right quadrant.
    - Bottom half: Concatenates the mirrored and rotated quadrant with the bottom-right quadrant of the input grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)) # Create an empty canvas
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if i < h // 2 and j >= w // 2:
      O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))})
      O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (h - i - 1, j))})
    else:
      O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates a canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with the most frequent color.
2. **Conditional Painting:** Iterates through all cell indices of the input grid using `asindices`.
   - If the cell belongs to the top-right quadrant, it paints both the original and mirrored locations in the output grid.
   - Otherwise, it paints the corresponding cell in the output grid, keeping it identical to the input.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  mirrored_objs = frozenset({obj if leftmost(obj) < w // 2 else shift(vmirror(shift(obj, (-h // 2, 0))), (h, 0)) for obj in objs})
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), mirrored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extracts all objects from the input grid using `objects`.
2. **Mirroring Specific Objects:** Iterates through the extracted objects. If an object's leftmost point is in the right half of the grid, it mirrors and shifts the object to the bottom-left quadrant. Otherwise, it keeps the object unchanged.
3. **Painting Mirrored Objects:** Paints the transformed objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = I
  for i in range(h // 2):
    for j in range(w // 2, w):
      O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (h - i - 1, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** Starts with the output grid `O` being the same as the input grid `I`.
2. **Mirrored Quadrant Painting:** Iterates only through the top-right quadrant of the grid. For each cell, it paints the corresponding mirrored location in the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid with the value from the input grid. This directly modifies the output grid without creating a separate canvas.


These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, using various combinations of DSL functions and logic.
