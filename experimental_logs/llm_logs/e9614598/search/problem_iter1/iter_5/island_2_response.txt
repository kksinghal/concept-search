## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with the value '1' and extending them to the right with a line of '3's, three cells long. 

**Input 0:** Two isolated '1's are extended into horizontal lines of '1 3 3 3'.

**Input 1:**  Two isolated '1's are extended into horizontal lines of '1 3 3 3'. The position of the '1's in the input grid determines the starting position of the '3's extension.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations for each:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 2), (loc[0], loc[1] + 3)}, frozenset(ofcolor(I, ONE)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Finds the indices of all cells with value '1'.
2. **`lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 2), (loc[0], loc[1] + 3)}`:** This anonymous function takes an index `loc` and generates a set containing the indices of the three cells to its right.
3. **`apply(..., frozenset(ofcolor(I, ONE)))`:** Applies the anonymous function to each index obtained in step 1, essentially creating a set of sets where each inner set contains the indices to be filled with '3' for each '1'.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the set of sets into a single set containing all indices to be filled.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:**  Fills the input grid `I` with the value '3' at the indices provided by the previous step.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda loc: {(THREE, (loc[0], loc[1] + i)) for i in range(1, 4)}, frozenset(ofcolor(I, ONE)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Identifies the indices of cells with value '1'.
2. **`lambda loc: {(THREE, (loc[0], loc[1] + i)) for i in range(1, 4)}`:** For each index 'loc', generates a set of tuples, where each tuple represents a cell to be painted. The tuple contains the color '3' and the index (row, column) calculated from the input 'loc'.
3. **`apply(..., frozenset(ofcolor(I, ONE)))`:** Applies the lambda function to every index found in step 1, resulting in a set of sets of cell information.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the sets from step 3 into one set containing information about all cells to be painted.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the input grid `I` using the cell information from the previous step.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(loc):
    return {(THREE, (loc[0], j)) for j in range(loc[1] + 1, loc[1] + 4)}
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_right, frozenset(ofcolor(I, ONE)))))
```

**Explanation:**

 This version is similar to Version 2 but uses a named function `extend_right` instead of an anonymous lambda function. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, THREE,  merge(apply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + i) for i in range(1, 4)}, frozenset(ofcolor(I, ONE))))) 
```

**Explanation:**

 This version is similar to Version 1 but uses a different way of generating the indices to be filled. Instead of listing each index individually, it uses a loop within a set comprehension.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def line_right(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return {(i, j + 1), (i, j + 2), (i, j + 3)}
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(line_right, frozenset(ofcolor(I, ONE)))))
```

**Explanation:**

 This version utilizes a named function `line_right` to calculate the indices for filling. It unpacks the input index 'loc' for clarity and then returns the three indices to the right.

All five versions achieve the same transformation but demonstrate different ways of achieving this within the DSL. Each version showcases a different aspect of the DSL's functionality and coding style.
