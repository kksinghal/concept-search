## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify objects formed by the digit '1' and extend them horizontally with the digit '3', creating a bar shape. 

**Input 0:** 
- Two single-cell objects formed by '1'.
- Output extends each object by adding two '3' cells horizontally, one on each side of the '1'.

**Input 1:** 
- Two single-cell objects formed by '1'.
- Output extends each object by adding three '3' cells horizontally on one side of the '1', forming a bar extending to the left.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Get indices of '1' cells
  extensions = mapply(lambda ij: {(ij[0], ij[1] - 1), (ij[0], ij[1] + 1)}, obj_indices)  # Get extension indices
  O = underfill(I, THREE, merge(extensions))  # Fill extensions with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify '1' cells:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Calculate extension indices:** `mapply` applies the lambda function to each '1' index to get the indices of the cells to the left and right. 
3. **Merge extensions:** `merge` combines all extension indices into a single set.
4. **Fill with '3':** `underfill` fills the extension indices with '3' while leaving existing non-background cells unchanged.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I) # Object formed by '1's
  left_extension = shift(toindices(obj), (0,-1)) # Shift indices left
  right_extension = shift(toindices(obj), (0,1)) # Shift indices right
  O = underfill(underfill(I, THREE, left_extension), THREE, right_extension)  # Fill both sides with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify the object:** `toobject` creates the object from the indices of '1's.
2. **Shift indices:**  `shift` creates two sets of indices, one shifted left and one shifted right.
3. **Fill sequentially:**  `underfill` is applied twice, first to fill the left extensions and then the right extensions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)  # Object formed by '1's
  h_extended_obj = mapply(lambda cell: {(cell[0], cell[1][0] - 1, cell[1][1]), (cell[0], cell[1][0] + 1, cell[1][1])}, obj) # Generate horizontally extended object
  O = paint(I, merge(h_extended_obj))  # Paint extended object onto original grid
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Generate extended object:**  `mapply` applies a lambda function to each cell in the object. The lambda function creates two new cells with the same value, one to the left and one to the right.
3. **Paint onto the grid:** `paint` directly paints the extended object onto the original grid, overwriting existing cells.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Get indices of '1' cells
  horizontal_line = lambda ij: {(ij[0], j) for j in range(ij[1]-1, ij[1]+2)} # Generate a horizontal line of length 3
  extensions = mapply(horizontal_line, obj_indices) # Apply horizontal line generation to each '1' index
  O = underfill(I, THREE, merge(extensions)) # Fill extensions with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' cells:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Generate horizontal line indices:** A lambda function `horizontal_line` is defined to generate a set of indices representing a horizontal line of length 3 centered at the input index.
3. **Apply line generation:** `mapply` applies `horizontal_line` to each '1' index, creating sets of indices for horizontal lines centered at each '1'.
4. **Merge and fill:**  Similar to Version 1, extensions are merged and filled with '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  extended_grid = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == ONE:
        extended_grid = fill(extended_grid, THREE, {(i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1)}) # Fill a horizontal line on the canvas
  return cellwise(I, extended_grid, I) # Combine the original grid with the extensions
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create empty canvas:** An empty canvas of the same size as the input is created.
2. **Iterate and fill:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains '1', a horizontal line of length 3 is filled with '3' on the canvas, centered at the '1' cell.
3. **Combine grids:** `cellwise` combines the original grid with the extended grid, retaining the original values where they match and using the extended grid values otherwise.

These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieving the transformation, employing various DSL functions and demonstrating the flexibility of the language.
