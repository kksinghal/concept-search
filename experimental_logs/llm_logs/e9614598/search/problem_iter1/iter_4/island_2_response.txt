## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with the value '1' and extending a horizontal line of '3's to the right of these cells. The line extends for three cells.

**Input_0:**

* Two cells have the value '1'.
* For each of these cells, three '3's are placed to the right, creating two horizontal lines.

**Input_1:**

* Two cells have the value '1'.
* Like in Input_0, horizontal lines of '3's are extended to the right of these cells.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 2), (loc[0], loc[1] + 3)}, ofcolor(I, ONE))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells with the value '1'.
2. **`lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 2), (loc[0], loc[1] + 3)}`:**  For each identified index (`loc`), this anonymous function generates a set of indices representing a horizontal line extending three cells to the right. 
3. **`apply(..., ofcolor(I, ONE))`:** Applies the anonymous function to each index returned by `ofcolor`.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the generated sets of indices into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:**  Fills the input grid (`I`) with the value '3' at all the indices within the merged set.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda loc: {(THREE, (i, j)) for i, j in zip(repeat(loc[0], 3), range(loc[1] + 1, loc[1] + 4))}, ofcolor(I, ONE))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Finds the indices of cells with the value '1'.
2. **`lambda loc: ...`:**  This anonymous function generates an object representing a horizontal line of '3's extending three cells to the right from the input `loc`.
3. **`apply(..., ofcolor(I, ONE))`:** Applies the anonymous function to each '1'-cell index.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all generated objects into a single object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined object onto the input grid (`I`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(loc):
    return {(THREE, (loc[0], j)) for j in range(loc[1] + 1, loc[1] + 4)}
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_right, ofcolor(I, ONE))))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version is structurally similar to version 2 but uses a named function `extend_right` instead of an anonymous function for improved readability.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, THREE,  mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + i) for i in range(1, 4)}, ofcolor(I, ONE)))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes the `mapply` function to streamline the application of the line-generating function and merging of the resulting index sets.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, THREE, merge([{(i, j + d) for d in range(1, 4)} for i, j in ofcolor(I, ONE)]))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses list comprehension for a more compact way to generate and merge the sets of indices representing the horizontal lines.

Each of these versions implements the same transformation logic but employs different DSL function combinations, offering varying levels of conciseness and readability.
