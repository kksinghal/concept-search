## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves drawing a vertical line of '3's, three cells high, centered on each '1' in the input grid. 

**Input_0 Example:**

- The '1' at (4,1) results in a vertical line of '3's at (3,1), (4,1), and (5,1).
- The '1' at (4,7) results in a vertical line of '3's at (3,7), (4,7), and (5,7).

**Input_1 Example:**

- The '1' at (0,3) results in a vertical line of '3's at (0,3), (1,3), and (2,3).
- The '1' at (8,3) results in a vertical line of '3's at (7,3), (8,3), and (9,3).


## Program Version 1: 

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of color '1'
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Create vertical line indices for each '1' index
  vlines = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0] - 1, loc[1]), loc, (loc[0] + 1, loc[1])}), ones_indices)
  # Fill all line indices with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(vlines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Finds the indices (row, column) of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the value '1'.
2. **`vlines = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0] - 1, loc[1]), loc, (loc[0] + 1, loc[1])}), ones_indices)`:** For each '1' index `loc`, this creates a set of indices representing a vertical line: one above, the '1' itself, and one below. `mapply` applies this to all indices and merges the results.
3. **`O = fill(I, THREE, merge(vlines))`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the value '3' at all the indices present in the `vlines` set.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find objects of color '1'
  obj_ones = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)
  # Create vertical lines for each object
  vlines =  frozenset({(THREE, (i + k, j)) for obj in obj_ones for (v, (i, j)) in obj for k in [-1, 0, 1]})
  # Paint the lines onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, vlines)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_ones = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)`:**  Finds all objects (connected components) of '1's in the grid.
2. **`vlines =  frozenset({(THREE, (i + k, j)) for obj in obj_ones for (v, (i, j)) in obj for k in [-1, 0, 1]})`:** Iterates through each object (`obj`) and each cell (`v`, `(i, j)`) within the object. For each cell, it generates three new cells with value '3', one above, one at the same position, and one below. 
3. **`O = paint(I, vlines)`:**  Paints the generated `vlines` onto a copy of the input grid `I`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find objects of color '1'
  obj_ones = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)
  # Shift each object up and down, combine with original, and recolor to 3
  vlines = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (-1, 0)) | obj | shift(obj, (1, 0))), obj_ones)
  # Paint the lines onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, merge(vlines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_ones = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)`:** Extracts objects of color '1' from the input grid.
2. **`vlines = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (-1, 0)) | obj | shift(obj, (1, 0))), obj_ones)`:** For each object:
    - `shift(obj, (-1, 0))`: Shifts the object one cell upwards.
    - `shift(obj, (1, 0))`: Shifts the object one cell downwards.
    - `| obj`: Combines the shifted objects with the original object.
    - `recolor(THREE, ...)`: Recolors the combined object to have the value '3'.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(vlines))`:**  Paints the merged vertical lines (`vlines`) onto the input grid `I`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        for k in [-1,0,1]:
          if 0 <= i + k < height(I):
            O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i + k, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through the grid:**  The code then iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
3. **`if I[i][j] == ONE:`:** If the current cell contains a '1', it proceeds to draw a vertical line.
4. **`for k in [-1,0,1]:`**:  This loop iterates three times, with `k` taking the values -1, 0, and 1.
5. **`if 0 <= i + k < height(I):`:**  This checks if the row index `i+k` is within the bounds of the grid.
6. **`O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i + k, j))})`:**  If the index is valid, it paints a '3' on the output grid `O` at the location `(i + k, j)`, effectively drawing a vertical line of '3's centered on the original '1'.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  for i, j in ones:
    O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i - 1, j)), (THREE, (i, j)), (THREE, (i + 1, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with zeros.
2. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells in `I` that contain the value '1'.
3. **`for i, j in ones:`:**  Iterates over each index `(i, j)` where a '1' is present in the input grid.
4. **`O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i - 1, j)), (THREE, (i, j)), (THREE, (i + 1, j))})`:** For each '1' location, it paints three '3's vertically: one above (i-1, j), one at the same location (i, j), and one below (i+1, j) on the output grid `O`.
