## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a grid and identifies objects formed by the digit '1'. For each object, it extends horizontally to the left and right by one cell, filling these extensions with the digit '3'. The original object itself remains unchanged.

**Example:**

In Input_0, there are two single-cell objects formed by '1'. Each gets extended horizontally with '3' on both sides.

In Input_1, there are two single-cell objects formed by '1'.  Again, each gets extended horizontally with '3' on both sides.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I) # Identify the object formed by '1'
  h_extension = mapply(lambda ij: {(ij[0], ij[1] - 1),(ij[0], ij[1] + 1)}, toindices(obj)) # Horizontal extension indices
  O = underfill(I, THREE, merge(h_extension)) # Fill extensions with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** `toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)` finds the indices of '1' and creates an object representation.
2. **Horizontal Extension:** `mapply(lambda ij: {(ij[0], ij[1] - 1),(ij[0], ij[1] + 1)}, toindices(obj))` generates a set of indices representing the left and right extensions for each cell in the object.
3. **Merge Extensions:** `merge(h_extension)` combines all the extension indices into a single set.
4. **Fill Extensions:** `underfill(I, THREE, merge(h_extension))` fills the identified extension indices with '3' while leaving the original object ('1') untouched. 

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I) # Identify the object
  left_extension = shift(toindices(obj), (0, -1)) # Shift indices left
  right_extension = shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)) # Shift indices right
  O = underfill(I, THREE, left_extension | right_extension) # Fill left and right extensions with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shift Indices:** `shift(toindices(obj), (0, -1))` and `shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1))` create sets of indices shifted one position to the left and right, respectively.
3. **Combine and Fill:**  The left and right extensions are combined (`|`) and filled with '3' using `underfill`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, hconcat(switch(lefthalf(I), ONE, THREE), switch(righthalf(I), ONE, THREE)), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split and Switch:** The grid is split into left and right halves. In each half, '1' is replaced with '3' using `switch`.
2. **Concatenate:** The modified halves are concatenated horizontally using `hconcat`.
3. **Cellwise Match:** `cellwise` compares the original grid with the concatenated grid.  If the values match, the original value is kept; otherwise, the value from the concatenated grid (which will be '3' at the extensions) is used.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  extended_grid = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, mapply(lambda ij: {(ij[0], ij[1] - 1),(ij[0], ij[1] + 1)}, ofcolor(I, ONE))) 
  return cellwise(I, extended_grid, I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Extension Grid:** A new grid filled with '0' is created with the same shape as the input. Then, the horizontal extensions of '1' indices are filled with '3'.
2. **Cellwise Merge:**  The original grid and the extension grid are combined using `cellwise`. This retains the original object while adding the '3' extensions.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toindices(toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)) # Get object indices
  O = I
  for i, j in obj:
      if j > 0:
          O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j-1)}) # Fill left if not on edge
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1:
          O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j+1)}) # Fill right if not on edge
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Object Indices:** Similar to previous versions, this identifies the object's indices.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The code iterates through each object cell's index. If the cell is not on the left or right edge, it fills the adjacent cell with '3'. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation, using various DSL functions and logic.
