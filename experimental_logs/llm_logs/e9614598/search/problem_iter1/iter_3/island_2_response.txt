## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying locations of the digit '1' in the input grid and extending a line of '3's to the right of these locations. The line extends three cells to the right. 

**Input_0:**
- Two '1's are present.
- For each '1', three '3's are added to the right.

**Input_1:**
- Two '1's are present.
- For each '1', three '3's are added to the right.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(prapply(lambda i, j: {(i, j + 1), (i, j + 2), (i, j + 3)}, {i for i, j in ofcolor(I, ONE)}, {j for i, j in ofcolor(I, ONE)})))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **`{i for i, j in ...}, {j for i, j in ...}`:** Extracts the row and column indices of the '1's separately.
3. **`prapply(lambda i, j: {(i, j + 1), (i, j + 2), (i, j + 3)}, ..., ...)`:** For every combination of row (i) and column (j) where a '1' is present, creates a set of indices representing three cells to the right: (i, j+1), (i, j+2), (i, j+3).
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all the generated index sets into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the value '3' at the indices specified by the merged set.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(i, j):
    return {(THREE, (i, j + 1)), (THREE, (i, j + 2)), (THREE, (i, j + 3))}
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda loc: extend_right(*loc), ofcolor(I, ONE))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_right(i, j)`:** Defines a helper function that takes row and column indices and returns a set of tuples representing cells with '3' extending three cells to the right.
2. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
3. **`apply(lambda loc: extend_right(*loc), ...)`:** Applies the `extend_right` function to each index tuple in the result of `ofcolor`.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting sets of '3'-filled cell tuples.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the input grid `I` with the '3'-filled cells from the merged set.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, THREE, mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 2), (loc[0], loc[1] + 3)}, ofcolor(I, ONE)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Retrieves the indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **`mapply(lambda loc: ..., ...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each index tuple from `ofcolor`.
3. **`lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ...}`:** For each index, this lambda function generates a set containing the indices of three cells to the right.
4. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:**  Fills the input grid `I` with '3' at the specified indices generated by the `mapply` function.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  extended = set()
  for i, j in ofcolor(I, ONE):
    extended |= {(i, j + 1), (i, j + 2), (i, j + 3)}
  return fill(I, THREE, extended) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extended = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store the indices where '3's will be placed.
2. **`for i, j in ofcolor(I, ONE):`**: Iterates over each index `(i, j)` of cells containing '1' in the input grid `I`.
3. **`extended |= {(i, j + 1), (i, j + 2), (i, j + 3)}`:** For each index, adds the indices of the three cells to the right to the `extended` set.
4. **`return fill(I, THREE, extended)`:** Finally, it returns the input grid `I` with the value '3' filled at all the indices present in the `extended` set.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_line(loc):
    return {(loc[0], loc[1] + d) for d in range(1, 4)}
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(extend_line, ofcolor(I, ONE))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_line(loc)`:** This helper function takes an index `loc` and generates a set of indices representing a three-cell horizontal line starting one cell to the right of the input index.
2. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Retrieves the indices of all '1's in the input grid `I`.
3. **`apply(extend_line, ...)`:** Applies the `extend_line` function to each index of '1'.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting sets of indices into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the value '3' at the indices present in the merged set.


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, employing various DSL functions and logic constructs. This demonstrates the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving this spatial reasoning task.
