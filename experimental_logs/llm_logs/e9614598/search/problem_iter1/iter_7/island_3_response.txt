## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes all objects with the value "1" and expands them horizontally by one cell on each side, filling these new cells with the value "3". The expansion only occurs if the new cells would fall within the existing grid boundaries.

**Input 0:**

* The single "1" objects are expanded horizontally, resulting in three consecutive "3" values on either side of each "1".

**Input 1:**

*  Similar to Input 0, the "1" objects are expanded horizontally. Since the objects are located on the edge of the grid, the expansion only occurs inwards, adding a single "3" value next to each "1". 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Get indices of '1' cells
  left_extensions = mapply(lambda ij: (ij[0], ij[1] - 1), obj_indices)  # Generate left extensions
  right_extensions = mapply(lambda ij: (ij[0], ij[1] + 1), obj_indices)  # Generate right extensions
  extensions = combine(left_extensions, right_extensions) # Combine left and right extensions
  O = underfill(I, THREE, merge(extensions)) # Fill extensions with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)`**: Identifies the indices of all cells containing the value "1".
2. **`left_extensions = mapply(lambda ij: (ij[0], ij[1] - 1), obj_indices)`**: Generates a set of indices shifted one position to the left of each "1" cell.
3. **`right_extensions = mapply(lambda ij: (ij[0], ij[1] + 1), obj_indices)`**: Generates a set of indices shifted one position to the right of each "1" cell.
4. **`extensions = combine(left_extensions, right_extensions)`**: Combines the left and right extensions into a single set.
5. **`O = underfill(I, THREE, merge(extensions))`**: Fills the combined set of extension indices with the value "3" on the original grid `I`, only overwriting cells containing the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I) # Find the object made of '1's
  h_expanded_obj = mapply(lambda cell: frozenset({(cell[0], (cell[1][0], j)) for j in range(cell[1][1] - 1, cell[1][1] + 2)}), obj)  # Expand object horizontally
  O = underpaint(I, merge(h_expanded_obj)) # Paint expanded object onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)`**: Extracts the object consisting of cells with the value "1".
2. **`h_expanded_obj = mapply(...)`**:  Expands the object horizontally by creating a new set of cells that includes the original cells and their immediate horizontal neighbors.
3. **`O = underpaint(I, merge(h_expanded_obj))`**:  Paints the expanded object back onto the original grid `I`, overwriting only cells with the background color. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  horizontal_line = canvas(THREE, (1, 3)) # Create a horizontal line of '3's
  obj_locations = occurrences(I, ((ONE, (0, 1)),))  # Find locations of the '1' object
  O = I
  for loc in obj_locations:
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(horizontal_line), loc))  # Paint the horizontal line at each object location
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`horizontal_line = canvas(THREE, (1, 3))`**: Creates a 1x3 grid filled with the value "3", representing the horizontal expansion pattern.
2. **`obj_locations = occurrences(I, ((ONE, (0, 1)),))`**: Finds all occurrences of a single-cell object with value "1" in the grid.
3. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4. The `for` loop iterates through each found object location:
   - **`O = paint(O, shift(asobject(horizontal_line), loc))`**: Shifts the pre-made horizontal line to the current object location and paints it onto the output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      for i in range(len(I)):
          if I[i][j] == ONE:
              if I[i][j-1] == ZERO:
                O = fill(O, THREE, ((i,j-1),))
              if I[i][j+1] == ZERO:
                O = fill(O, THREE, ((i,j+1),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`O = I`**:  Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2.  The nested `for` loops iterate through each cell in the grid (excluding border cells):
    -   **`if I[i][j] == ONE:`**:  Checks if the current cell contains the value "1".
    -   **`if I[i][j-1] == ZERO:`**: If the cell to the left is "0" (background), it is filled with "3" in the output grid.
    -   **`if I[i][j+1] == ZERO:`**: If the cell to the right is "0" (background), it is filled with "3" in the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Get indices of '1' cells
  extensions = frozenset()
  for (i, j) in obj_indices:
    extensions = extensions | {(i, j-1), (i, j+1)}  # Add left and right extensions for each '1' cell
  O = underfill(I, THREE, extensions)  # Fill extensions with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)`**:  Identifies the indices of all cells containing the value "1".
2. **`extensions = frozenset()`**: Initializes an empty set to store the extension indices.
3. The `for` loop iterates through each index in `obj_indices`:
   - **`extensions = extensions | {(i, j-1), (i, j+1)}`**: Adds the indices to the left and right of the current "1" cell to the `extensions` set.
4. **`O = underfill(I, THREE, extensions)`**:  Fills the indices in the `extensions` set with the value "3" on the original grid `I`, overwriting only background cells.

These five programs provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages different combinations of functions and logic, offering a diverse set of solutions for this specific task.
