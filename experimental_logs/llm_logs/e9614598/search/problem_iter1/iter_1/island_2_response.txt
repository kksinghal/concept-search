## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with the value `1` and then drawing a horizontal line of `3`s to the right of these cells, extending three cells long.

**Input_0:**

* Two `1`s are present.
* For each `1`, a horizontal line of three `3`s is drawn to the right.

**Input_1:**

* Two `1`s are present.
* The transformation is applied similarly to Input_0.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different DSL functions:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by `ofcolor` and `fill`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(fill(fill(I, THREE, mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}, ofcolor(I, ONE))), THREE, mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 2)}, ofcolor(I, ONE))), THREE, mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 3)}, ofcolor(I, ONE)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Finds all indices of cells containing `1`.
2. `mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}, ...)`: For each index, creates a new index one position to the right.
3. `fill(I, THREE, ...)`:  Fills the grid `I` with value `3` at the newly generated indices, effectively drawing the first `3` of the line.
4. This process is repeated twice, incrementing the column offset to draw the remaining two `3`s of the line.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by `partition` and set comprehension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({{(THREE, (i, j + 1)), (THREE, (i, j + 2)), (THREE, (i, j + 3))} for obj in partition(I) for v, (i, j) in obj if v == ONE}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `partition(I)`: Divides the grid into objects based on cell values.
2. `{(THREE, (i, j + 1)), ...} for obj in ... for v, (i, j) in obj if v == ONE}`: Iterates through each object and, if its value (`v`) is `1`, generates three new cells with value `3` to the right of the original cell.
3. `merge(...)`:  Merges all the generated cells into a single object.
4. `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the generated object onto the input grid `I`.

**Version 3:** (Inspired by `for loop` and `index`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    new_grid = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if I[i][j] == ONE:
                for k in range(1, 4):
                    if j + k < w:
                        new_grid[i][j + k] = THREE
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a new grid `new_grid` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. If a cell's value is `1`, it enters a nested loop to change the values of the next three cells to the right to `3`, ensuring it stays within the grid boundaries.
4. Finally, it returns the modified `new_grid`.

**Version 4:** (Inspired by list comprehension and conditional expression)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(THREE if any(I[i][k] == ONE and 1 <= j - k <= 3 for k in range(len(I[0]))) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version uses nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation in a single line.
2. It iterates through each cell `v` at index `(i, j)` in the grid `I`.
3. For each cell, it checks if there is any cell with value `1` in the same row within a 3-cell distance to the left. If true, it replaces the current cell with `3`; otherwise, it keeps the original value `v`. 

**Version 5:** (Inspired by `shift` and `underpaint`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  line = frozenset({(THREE, (0, 1)), (THREE, (0, 2)), (THREE, (0, 3))})
  return underpaint(I, merge({shift(line, (i, j)) for i, j in ofcolor(I, ONE)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines a `line` object representing the horizontal line of `3`s.
2. `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of cells with value `1`.
3. `shift(line, (i, j))`:  Shifts the `line` object to the location of each identified `1`.
4. `merge(...)` combines all the shifted lines into a single object.
5. `underpaint(I, ...)`:  Paints the combined lines onto the input grid `I`, only affecting cells that were originally the background color.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
