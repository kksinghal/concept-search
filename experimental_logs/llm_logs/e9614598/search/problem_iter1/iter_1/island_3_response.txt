## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects represented by the digit '1' in the input grid. It identifies these objects and expands them by one unit in each direction (up, down, left, right), filling the expanded area with the digit '3'. The original '1' remains unchanged. 

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 3 3 3
0 0 0 3 0
```

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)  # Find the object made of '1's
  expanded_indices = delta(toindices(obj))  # Get indices surrounding the object
  O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)  # Fill surrounding indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** `toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)` finds the indices of cells containing '1' and converts them into an object representation.
2. **Expand the object:** `delta(toindices(obj))` determines the indices immediately surrounding the object.
3. **Fill the expansion:** `fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)` replaces the values at the expanded indices with '3', effectively expanding the object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)
  shifted_objects = (shift(obj, d) for d in (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)) # Create shifted copies of the object
  expanded_area = merge(shifted_objects)  # Combine shifted objects to get expanded area
  O = underfill(I, THREE, expanded_area)  # Fill the expanded area with '3' under the original object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shift and Expand:** The object is shifted in all four directions and merged to create the expanded area.
3. **Underfill:** `underfill` fills the expanded area with '3' only where the original grid has the background color (most common color), ensuring the original '1's are preserved. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = toindices(toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I))
  neighborhood = mapply(dneighbors, obj) # Find all direct neighbors of object cells
  expansion = neighborhood - obj  # Exclude original object cells
  O = fill(I, THREE, expansion)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to Version 1, but directly extracts indices.
2. **Find Neighbors:** `mapply(dneighbors, obj)` finds all directly adjacent neighbors of each cell in the object.
3. **Isolate Expansion:** The original object indices are removed from the neighbors set, leaving only the expansion area.
4. **Fill Expansion:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  modified_grid = canvas(THREE, shape(I))  # Create a canvas filled with '3'
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)
  O = underpaint(modified_grid, obj) # Paint the original '1's onto the modified grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Filled Canvas:**  A new grid is created with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with '3's.
2. **Identify the object:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Underpaint:** `underpaint` is used to draw the original object ('1's) onto the canvas filled with '3's. This effectively achieves the expansion.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def expand_cell(i, j):
        return {(i + di, j + dj) for di in (-1, 0, 1) for dj in (-1, 0, 1)} - {(i, j)}

    obj_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    expanded_indices = mfilter(lambda ij: 0 <= ij[0] < len(I) and 0 <= ij[1] < len(I[0]),
                             mapply(expand_cell, obj_indices))
    O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `expand_cell` Function:**  A helper function `expand_cell` is defined to find the surrounding cells of a given cell (excluding the cell itself).
2. **Identify Object Indices:**  `ofcolor(I, ONE)` is used to get the indices of cells with the value '1'.
3. **Calculate Expanded Indices:** `mapply(expand_cell, obj_indices)` applies the `expand_cell` function to each object cell index, resulting in a set of surrounding indices. `mfilter` is then used to filter out any indices that fall outside the grid boundaries.
4. **Fill Expansion:** `fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)` fills the expanded indices with the value '3'.

These five program versions offer different approaches to achieve the same grid transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the provided DSL.
