## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of '1's and drawing a horizontal line of '3's centered on each object. The length of the line is always three cells.

**Input_0:**

* Two single-cell objects of '1' are present.
* For each object, a horizontal line of three '3's is drawn, centered on the '1'.

**Input_1:**

* Two single-cell objects of '1' are present.
* For each object, a horizontal line of three '3's is drawn, centered on the '1'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find objects of color '1'
  obj_ones = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)
  # Get the center of each object
  centers = mapply(center, obj_ones)
  # Create the horizontal line of '3's
  line = lambda loc: frozenset({(THREE, (loc[0], loc[1] - 1)), (THREE, (loc[0], loc[1])), (THREE, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1))})
  # Paint the line at each center
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(line, centers)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)`: Finds all objects made of '1's.
2. `mapply(center, obj_ones)`: Finds the center coordinates of each '1' object.
3. `line = lambda loc: frozenset({(THREE, (loc[0], loc[1] - 1)), (THREE, (loc[0], loc[1])), (THREE, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1))})`:  This lambda function takes a location tuple `(i, j)` and generates a set representing a horizontal line of three '3's centered at that location. 
4. `apply(line, centers)`: Applies the `line` function to each center coordinate, creating a set of lines.
5. `merge(...)`: Merges all the generated lines into a single set.
6. `paint(I, ...)`:  Paints the merged lines onto the original grid `I`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of color '1'
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Create horizontal line indices for each '1' index
  lines = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0], loc[1] - 1), (loc[0], loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}), ones_indices)
  # Fill all line indices with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Retrieves the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. `lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0], loc[1] - 1), (loc[0], loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)})`: This lambda function generates a set of indices representing a horizontal line of length 3, centered at the input `loc`.
3. `mapply(..., ones_indices)`: Applies the lambda function to each '1' index, generating sets of line indices.
4. `merge(lines)`: Merges all the generated line index sets into a single set.
5. `fill(I, THREE, ...)`: Fills all the indices within the merged set with the value '3' on the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  # Iterate through each cell in the grid
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      # If the cell is '1', draw a horizontal line of '3's
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        for k in range(-1, 2):
          if 0 <= j + k < len(I[0]):
            O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset({(i, j + k)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version iterates through every cell of the input grid `I`.
2. If a cell contains '1', it paints a horizontal line of '3's centered at that cell's location, ensuring the line stays within the grid boundaries.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find objects of color '1'
    obj_ones = objects(I, T, F, T)
    # Filter for objects of size 1
    single_ones = sizefilter(obj_ones, ONE)
    # Create horizontal line for each single '1' object
    lines = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (0, -1)) | obj | shift(obj, (0, 1))), single_ones)
    # Paint the lines onto the input grid
    O = paint(I, merge(lines))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Finds all objects in the grid.
2. `sizefilter(obj_ones, ONE)`: Filters for objects that consist of only one cell (single '1's).
3. `lambda obj: recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (0, -1)) | obj | shift(obj, (0, 1)))`: This lambda function takes a single-cell object and:
    *  `shift(obj, (0, -1)) | obj | shift(obj, (0, 1))`: Creates a set representing a horizontal line by shifting the object left, keeping the original, and shifting it right.
    *  `recolor(THREE, ...)`: Recolors the entire line to '3'.
4. `mapply(..., single_ones)`: Applies the lambda function to each single-cell '1' object, creating sets of line objects.
5. `merge(lines)`: Merges all line objects into a single set.
6. `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the merged lines onto the original grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Create a canvas of zeros with the same shape as the input
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    # Find indices of color '1' in the input
    ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    # Create horizontal line function
    draw_hline = lambda i, j: frozenset({(i, j - 1), (i, j), (i, j + 1)})
    # Apply the function to each '1' index and paint '3's
    for i, j in ones_indices:
        O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, draw_hline(i, j)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`: Creates a blank canvas filled with zeros, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. `ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Finds the indices of all cells in the input grid containing '1'.
3. `draw_hline = lambda i, j: frozenset({(i, j - 1), (i, j), (i, j + 1)})`: Defines a lambda function to create a set of indices representing a horizontal line of length 3 centered at the given `(i, j)` coordinates.
4. The code iterates through each `(i, j)` index where a '1' is present in the input grid.
5. For each '1' index, it generates the horizontal line indices using `draw_hline`, recolors the line to '3' using `recolor`, and then paints it onto the initially blank canvas `O` using `paint`.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
