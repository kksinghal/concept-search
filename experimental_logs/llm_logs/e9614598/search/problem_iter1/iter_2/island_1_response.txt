## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves drawing a vertical line of '3's centered on each '1' in the input grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- Two '1's are present in the input grid.
- For each '1', a vertical line of three '3's is drawn, centered on the '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- Two '1's are present in the input grid.
- For each '1', a vertical line of three '3's is drawn, centered on the '1'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of color '1'
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Create vertical line indices for each '1' index
  vlines = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0] - 1, loc[1]), loc, (loc[0] + 1, loc[1])}), ones_indices)
  # Fill all line indices with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(vlines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Generate vertical line indices:** For each '1' index, a lambda function generates a set of three indices representing a vertical line centered on that index. `mapply` applies this function to all '1' indices, creating a set of lines.
3. **Fill lines with '3':**  `merge` combines all line indices. `fill(I, THREE, ...)` fills these indices with '3' on the input grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find objects of color '1'
  obj_ones = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)
  # Create vertical lines for each object
  vlines = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (-1, 0)) | obj | shift(obj, (1, 0))), obj_ones)
  # Paint the lines onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, merge(vlines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' objects:** `objects` identifies all connected components ('objects') in the grid. `colorfilter` then selects only objects consisting of '1's.
2. **Generate vertical lines:** For each '1' object, the lambda function creates a new object representing a vertical line by shifting the original object up and down and combining them using set union.  `recolor` sets the color of the new object to '3'.
3. **Paint lines on the grid:**  `merge` combines all line objects. `paint(I, ...)` draws these lines onto the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Iterate through each cell in the grid
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      # If the cell value is '1'
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        # Paint a vertical line of '3's
        for k in range(-1, 2):
          if 0 <= i + k < height(I):
            O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i + k, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This program iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
2. **Check for '1':** If the current cell contains a '1', it proceeds to draw a line.
3. **Draw vertical line:**  For each '1', it iterates through three rows (k = -1, 0, 1) and paints a '3' at the corresponding column. Boundary checks ensure the line stays within the grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find objects of color '1'
    obj_ones = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)
    # Get the center of each object
    centers = mapply(center, obj_ones)
    # Create the vertical line of '3's
    vline = lambda loc: frozenset({(THREE, (loc[0] - 1, loc[1])), (THREE, loc), (THREE, (loc[0] + 1, loc[1]))})
    # Paint the line at each center
    O = paint(I, merge(apply(vline, centers)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' objects:** Similar to Version 2, it identifies objects consisting of '1's.
2. **Find object centers:** `mapply(center, obj_ones)` calculates the center coordinates of each '1' object.
3. **Generate vertical line objects:**  `vline` is a lambda function that takes a location and generates a vertical line object centered at that location.
4. **Paint lines on the grid:** `apply(vline, centers)` applies the `vline` function to each center point, creating the line objects. These objects are merged and then painted onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of color '1'
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Create vertical line indices using list comprehension
  vlines = frozenset({(i + k, j) for i, j in ones_indices for k in [-1, 0, 1] if 0 <= i + k < height(I)})
  # Fill all line indices with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, vlines)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:**  Identifies the indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **Generate vertical line indices:**  Uses a list comprehension to efficiently generate the set of all indices belonging to the vertical lines. For each '1' index, it adds the indices one row above and below, while staying within the grid boundaries.
3. **Fill lines with '3':**  `fill` fills the collected line indices with '3'.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic structures. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the problem while achieving the same output for the given input-output pairs.
