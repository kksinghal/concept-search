## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be extending the '1' objects to the right with '3's for a length of 3. 

Let's break it down:

* **Input_0:** The single '1's at (4,1) and (4,7) are extended rightwards with three '3's each.
* **Input_1:** Similarly, the '1's at (0,3) and (8,3) are extended rightwards with '3's.

Essentially, the transformation locates '1's and fills the next three positions to their right with '3's. 


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(fill(fill(I, THREE, mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}, ofcolor(I, ONE))), THREE, mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 2)}, ofcolor(I, ONE))), THREE, mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 3)}, ofcolor(I, ONE))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  This identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
2. **`mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}, ...)`:** For each '1' location, this creates a set containing the index to its right. We repeat this three times for offsets of 1, 2, and 3, effectively targeting the next three positions to the right.
3. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Finally, we use nested `fill` functions to change the value at the calculated indices to '3', achieving the desired extension.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(THREE, (i, j + 1)), (THREE, (i, j + 2)), (THREE, (i, j + 3))}) for (i, j) in ofcolor(I, ONE)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Similar to version 1, this gets the locations of all '1's.
2. **`{(THREE, (i, j + 1)), ...}`:** We use a set comprehension to generate a set of cell tuples representing the three positions to the right of each '1', with the value '3'.
3. **`merge(...)`:** This combines all individual sets of '3' cells into a single object.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** We use `paint` to apply this merged object onto the original grid, replacing the corresponding cells with '3's. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(prapply(lambda i, j: {(i, j + 1), (i, j + 2), (i, j + 3)}, {i for i, j in ofcolor(I, ONE)}, {j for i, j in ofcolor(I, ONE)})))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Finds the indices of cells with the value '1'.
2. **`{i for i, j in ...}` and `{j for i, j in ...}`:** Extracts the row and column indices of '1' cells, respectively.
3. **`prapply(lambda i, j: {(i, j + 1), (i, j + 2), (i, j + 3)}, ..., ...)`:**  Applies the lambda function to every combination of row and column indices where '1' is present. The lambda function creates a set of indices representing the three positions to the right. 
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all generated sets into a single set of indices.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Changes the values at the gathered indices to '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  extended_objects = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((THREE, (i, j + k)) for v, (i, j) in obj for k in range(1, 4)), sizefilter(partition(I), 1))
  return paint(I, merge(extended_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`sizefilter(partition(I), 1)`:** Isolates objects containing only a single cell.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** For each single-cell object, the lambda function generates a new object with the original value replaced by '3' and extends it three cells to the right.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the extended objects into a single object.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Applies the merged object to the original grid, achieving the extension. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(i, j):
    return {(THREE, (i, j + 1)), (THREE, (i, j + 2)), (THREE, (i, j + 3))}
  return paint(I, merge({extend_right(i, j) for i, j in ofcolor(I, ONE)})) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_right(i, j)`:** Defines a helper function to generate the three cell tuples representing the extension to the right.
2. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Gets the indices of all '1' cells.
3. **`{extend_right(i, j) for i, j in ...}`:** Applies the `extend_right` function to each '1' location, generating sets of extended cells.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all extended cell sets into one.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged object onto the original grid. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL, highlighting its flexibility and power. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, offering a diverse set of solutions.
