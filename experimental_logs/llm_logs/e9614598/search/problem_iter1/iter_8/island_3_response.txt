## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with the value '1' and then expanding them horizontally and vertically by one cell, filling these new cells with the value '3'. The original '1' cells remain unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  h_extensions = mapply(lambda ij: frozenset({(ONE, (ij[0], j)) for j in range(ij[1] - 1, ij[1] + 2)}), obj_indices)
  v_extensions = mapply(lambda ij: frozenset({(ONE, (i, ij[1])) for i in range(ij[0] - 1, ij[0] + 2)}), obj_indices)
  extensions = combine(h_extensions, v_extensions)
  O = underfill(I, THREE, merge(extensions))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' cells:** `obj_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)` gets the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Horizontal Expansion:** `h_extensions` creates a set of objects, each containing three horizontally adjacent cells centered on a '1' cell.
3. **Vertical Expansion:** `v_extensions` does the same vertically.
4. **Combine Extensions:** `extensions` merges the horizontal and vertical extensions.
5. **Fill with '3':** `underfill(I, THREE, merge(extensions))` fills all background cells within the extensions with '3'.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)
  shifted_objects = combine(shift(obj, UP), shift(obj, DOWN), shift(obj, LEFT), shift(obj, RIGHT))
  O = underpaint(I, merge(shifted_objects))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' object:** `obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)` creates an object from the '1' cells.
2. **Shift and Combine:** `shifted_objects` creates four shifted copies of the object - up, down, left, and right - then combines them.
3. **Underpaint:** `underpaint(I, merge(shifted_objects))` paints the combined shifted objects onto the grid, only affecting background cells.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_generated(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    neighbors_of_ones = mapply(neighbors, ones)
    O = underfill(I, THREE, merge(neighbors_of_ones))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' cells:** `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of cells with value '1'.
2. **Find Neighboring Cells:** `neighbors_of_ones` applies the `neighbors` function to each '1' cell's index, generating a set of their neighboring indices.
3. **Fill Neighbors with '3':** `O = underfill(I, THREE, merge(neighbors_of_ones))` merges all neighboring indices and fills them with '3' only if they were initially background cells.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)
    expanded_obj = mapply(lambda cell: toobject(dneighbors(cell[1]), I), obj)
    O = underpaint(I, merge(expanded_obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' object:** `obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)` creates an object with the '1' cells.
2. **Expand Object:** `expanded_obj` uses `mapply` to apply a lambda function to each cell in the object. 
    - The lambda function finds the direct neighbors (`dneighbors`) of each cell's index and converts them to an object using `toobject`. 
3. **Underpaint:** `O = underpaint(I, merge(expanded_obj))` merges all the expanded objects and paints them onto the grid, affecting only background cells.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  expanded_indices = mfilter(lambda ij: 0 <= ij[0] < len(I) and 0 <= ij[1] < len(I[0]),
                             prapply(lambda i, j: astuple(i, j),
                                     interval(uppermost(obj) - 1, lowermost(obj) + 2, 1),
                                     interval(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2, 1)))
  O = underfill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:** `obj = ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds indices of '1' cells.
2. **Generate Expanded Indices:**
    - `interval` functions create ranges for rows and columns around '1' cells.
    - `prapply` generates all index pairs within the expanded range using `astuple`.
    - `mfilter` filters out invalid indices outside the grid boundaries.
3. **Underfill:** `O = underfill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)` fills the valid expanded indices with '3' if they are background cells.

These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL. Each utilizes a different combination of functions and logic, demonstrating the diversity of possible solutions within the DSL framework.
