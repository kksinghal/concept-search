## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying single-pixel objects (value '1') and drawing a horizontal line of '3's to the right of the object, extending three pixels.  

**Input_0:** 
* Two single-pixel objects with value '1' exist.
* For each object, a horizontal line of three '3's is drawn to the right.

**Input_1:**
* Two single-pixel objects with value '1' exist.
* For each object, a horizontal line of three '3's is drawn to the right.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, THREE, mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 2), (loc[0], loc[1] + 3)}, ofcolor(I, ONE)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`**: Identifies the indices of cells with value '1'.
2. **`lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 2), (loc[0], loc[1] + 3)}`**: For each identified location, this lambda function generates a set containing the indices of the three cells to the right.
3. **`mapply(...)`**: Applies the lambda function to each location, generating a set of all indices to be filled.
4. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`**: Fills the identified indices with the value '3'. 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge({{(THREE, (i, j + 1)), (THREE, (i, j + 2)), (THREE, (i, j + 3))} for i, j in ofcolor(I, ONE)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`**: Identifies the indices of cells with value '1'.
2. **`{(THREE, (i, j + 1)), (THREE, (i, j + 2)), (THREE, (i, j + 3))}`**: For each identified location `(i, j)`, this creates a set of cell-value pairs representing the three '3' cells to the right.
3. **`{... for i, j in ...}`**: Applies the set creation to each location, generating a set of sets.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Merges the sets of cell-value pairs into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the identified cells with the value '3' onto the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sizefilter(partition(I), 1)
  line = lambda obj: {(THREE, (i, j + k)) for (v, (i, j)) in obj for k in range(1, 4)}
  return paint(I, merge(apply(line, objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`sizefilter(partition(I), 1)`**: Partitions the grid into objects and filters for objects with size 1 (single-pixel objects).
2. **`line = lambda obj: {(THREE, (i, j + k)) for (v, (i, j)) in obj for k in range(1, 4)}`**: Defines a lambda function `line` that takes an object and returns a set of cell-value pairs representing a horizontal line of three '3's to the right of the object.
3. **`apply(line, objs)`**: Applies the `line` function to each single-pixel object.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Merges the resulting sets of cell-value pairs.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the '3's onto the input grid at the identified locations.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i, j in ofcolor(I, ONE):
    I = fill(I, THREE, {(i, j + 1), (i, j + 2), (i, j + 3)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`**:  Gets the indices of cells with the value '1'.
2. **`for i, j in ...`**: Iterates through each of these indices.
3. **`fill(I, THREE, {(i, j + 1), (i, j + 2), (i, j + 3)})`**:  For each index `(i, j)`, fills the three cells to the right with the value '3'. The modified grid is assigned back to `I` in each iteration. 
4. **`return I`**: Returns the modified grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def draw_line(i, j):
    return {(THREE, (i, j + 1)), (THREE, (i, j + 2)), (THREE, (i, j + 3))}
  lines = mapply(lambda loc: draw_line(*loc), ofcolor(I, ONE))
  return paint(I, lines)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def draw_line(i, j): ...`**:  Defines a function `draw_line` which, given coordinates `(i, j)`, returns a set of cell-value pairs representing a three-cell horizontal line of '3's starting from the cell to the right of the given coordinates.
2. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`**: Retrieves the indices of cells with the value '1'. 
3. **`mapply(lambda loc: draw_line(*loc), ...)`**:  Applies the `draw_line` function to each of these indices using a lambda function for unpacking the coordinates. The result is a set of sets of cell-value pairs.
4. **`paint(I, lines)`**:  Paints the '3's onto the input grid `I` at the locations specified by the `lines` set.
