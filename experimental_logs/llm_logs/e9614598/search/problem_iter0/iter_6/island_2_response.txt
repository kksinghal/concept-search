## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grid can be described as follows:

**For every cell containing '1':**

1. **Extend:** Draw a horizontal line of '3's, centered on the '1' cell, extending one cell to the left and one cell to the right.
2. **Constrain:** The line should only be drawn within the grid boundaries; it should not wrap around.

This effectively replaces each '1' with a horizontal three-cell line of '3's.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all single-cell '1' objects.
  ones = sizefilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1) & colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1)
  # Create a function to generate the horizontal line indices.
  def make_hline(obj):
    i, j = first(toindices(obj))
    return frozenset({(i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1)})
  # Apply the function to each '1' object and merge the results.
  line_indices = merge(apply(make_hline, ones))
  # Fill the input grid with '3' at the generated line indices.
  return fill(I, 3, line_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' cells:** `ones = sizefilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1) & colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1)` finds all single-cell objects of color '1'.
2. **Generate line indices:** `make_hline(obj)` takes a '1' object and returns a set of indices representing the horizontal line centered on that object.
3. **Apply and merge:** `line_indices = merge(apply(make_hline, ones))` applies `make_hline` to each '1' object and merges the resulting sets of indices.
4. **Fill the grid:** `return fill(I, 3, line_indices)` fills the input grid `I` with '3' at the generated `line_indices`.

This version directly addresses the errors in the provided programs by ensuring the output of `make_hline` is a `frozenset`, which is hashable and compatible with `merge` and `apply`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of all '1's.
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  # Generate horizontal line indices for each '1' index.
  def make_hline(idx):
    return frozenset({(idx[0], idx[1]-1), (idx[0], idx[1]), (idx[0], idx[1]+1)})
  hline_indices = mapply(make_hline, one_indices)
  # Fill the grid with '3' at the generated indices.
  return fill(I, 3, merge(hline_indices)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' indices:** `one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)` retrieves the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Generate line indices:** `make_hline(idx)` takes an index and returns a frozenset of indices for the horizontal line centered on that index.
3. **Apply and merge:** `hline_indices = mapply(make_hline, one_indices)` applies `make_hline` to each index in `one_indices` and merges the resulting sets.
4. **Fill the grid:** `return fill(I, 3, merge(hline_indices))` fills the input grid `I` with '3' at the generated `hline_indices`.

This version avoids the `objects` function and directly uses indices, simplifying the logic and enhancing readability. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find single-cell '1' objects.
  ones = sizefilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1) & colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1)
  # Create a function to generate a shifted object representing the line.
  def make_line_obj(obj):
    i, j = first(toindices(obj))
    return frozenset({(3, (i, j-1)), (3, (i, j)), (3, (i, j+1))})
  # Apply the function and paint the objects.
  return paint(I, merge(apply(make_line_obj, ones)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' objects:** Similar to version 1, this identifies single-cell objects with color '1'.
2. **Generate line objects:** `make_line_obj(obj)` now directly creates a frozenset of cell tuples representing the horizontal line, with color '3', centered on the input object.
3. **Apply, merge, and paint:** The line objects are generated for each '1' object, merged, and directly painted onto the input grid using `paint`.

This version leverages the `paint` function for a more direct approach to modifying the grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
    shifted_indices = mapply(lambda idx: frozenset({(idx[0], idx[1]-1), (idx[0], idx[1]+1)}), one_indices)
    return fill(fill(I, 3, one_indices), 3, merge(shifted_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' indices:**  Similar to version 2, this identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Generate shifted indices:** Instead of generating the entire line at once, this version generates indices for the left and right cells adjacent to each '1' cell.
3. **Fill twice:** The grid is filled with '3's in two steps: first at the '1' indices and then at the shifted indices, effectively drawing the horizontal lines.

This version optimizes the process by filling the grid in two simpler steps instead of generating and merging larger sets of indices.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    lines = frozenset()
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == 1:
                lines = lines | frozenset({(i, max(0, j-1)), (i, j), (i, min(j+1, len(row)-1))})
    return fill(I, 3, lines)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This version directly iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Identify and extend:** If a cell contains '1', it constructs the horizontal line indices, ensuring they stay within grid boundaries using `max(0, j-1)` and `min(j+1, len(row)-1)`.
3. **Fill the grid:** Finally, it fills the grid with '3' at the collected line indices.

This version provides a more procedural and explicit approach to the transformation, potentially easier to understand for some users. 

Each of these five program versions demonstrates a distinct approach to achieving the desired transformation, offering a diverse set of solutions with varying levels of complexity and readability.
