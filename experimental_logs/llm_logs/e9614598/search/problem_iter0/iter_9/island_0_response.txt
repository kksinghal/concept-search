## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on horizontally extending the non-zero objects in the input grid to create a line of 3s, centered on the original object's horizontal center. 

**Input_0:**

* The single '1' object is extended horizontally with 3s to its left and right, forming a horizontal line of 3s with the '1' in the center.

**Input_1:**

*  Both '1' objects are independently extended horizontally with 3s, creating two separate horizontal lines of 3s, each centered on the original '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    center_j = left + (right - left) // 2
    for j in range(left, right + 1):
      O = fill(O, THREE, {(uppermost(obj), j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies all non-background objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Modify:**  The code iterates through each object (`obj`).
3. **Find Horizontal Extremes and Center:** `leftmost(obj)` and `rightmost(obj)` find the leftmost and rightmost columns of the object. `center_j` calculates the center column.
4. **Fill Line:** A horizontal line of 3s is drawn at the object's uppermost row (`uppermost(obj)`) from the leftmost to the rightmost column using `fill(O, THREE, {(uppermost(obj), j)})`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    center = centerofmass(obj)
    width = rightmost(obj) - leftmost(obj) + 1
    start = center[1] - width // 2
    end = start + width
    O = underfill(O, THREE, frozenset((center[0], j) for j in range(start, end)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Calculate Center and Width:** `centerofmass(obj)` finds the center of the object. The width is calculated using `rightmost` and `leftmost`.
3. **Determine Line Extremes:** The starting and ending columns for the horizontal line are calculated based on the center and width.
4. **Draw Line:** `underfill` draws the line of 3s, centered on the object, using the calculated start and end points.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  return underfill(I, THREE, merge(frozenset(connect((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))) for obj in objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find Horizontal Extremes:** Uses `leftmost` and `rightmost` to find the horizontal boundaries of each object.
3. **Create Line Segments:** For each object, `connect` creates a set of indices representing a horizontal line segment spanning its width.
4. **Merge and Fill:**  All line segments are merged, and `underfill` is used to draw the lines of 3s onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  lines = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    w = width(obj)
    c = centerofmass(obj)
    lines = lines | frozenset((c[0], c[1] + j - w // 2) for j in range(w))
  return underfill(I, THREE, lines)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Calculate Width and Center:** The width and center of each object are calculated.
3. **Generate Line Indices:**  For each object, a set of indices for the horizontal line is generated, centered on the object's center and spanning its width.
4. **Combine and Fill:** All generated indices are combined, and `underfill` draws the 3s at those locations.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    row = uppermost(obj)
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
      O = fill(O, THREE, frozenset({(row, j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate through Columns:**  For each object, the code iterates from its leftmost to its rightmost column.
3. **Fill at Each Column:** At each column within the object's horizontal span, `fill` is used to draw a 3 on the object's uppermost row. 

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a unique combination of functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
