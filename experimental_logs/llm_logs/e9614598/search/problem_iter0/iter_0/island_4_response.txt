## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the locations of specific digits (1 in these examples) and creating a plus-shaped pattern centered on those locations using a new digit (3 in these examples). 

**Input_0:**
* Two '1' digits exist.
* For each '1', a plus-shaped pattern of '3's is created, centered on the '1'. 

**Input_1:**
* Two '1' digits exist.
* The transformation is identical to Input_0.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1) 
  plus_pattern = frozenset({(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)})
  shifted_patterns = mapply(lambda loc: shift(plus_pattern, loc), ones)
  filled_grid = fill(I, 3, merge(shifted_patterns))
  return filled_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' locations:** `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` finds all indices of '1's in the input grid `I`.
2. **Define plus-shape:** `plus_pattern` defines the relative indices of the plus shape.
3. **Shift and merge:** `shifted_patterns` creates a set of plus-shapes, each centered on a '1' location, by shifting the `plus_pattern` to each location in `ones`. These are merged into a single set.
4. **Fill the grid:** `filled_grid` fills the input grid `I` with the new digit '3' at the indices specified by `shifted_patterns`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda loc: recolor(3, shift(frozenset({(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)}), loc)), ofcolor(I, 1))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic into a single line using function composition:

1. **Identify '1' locations:** `ofcolor(I, 1)`
2. **Shift and recolor:** For each '1' location:
    - `shift(...)`: Shift the predefined plus-shape indices to the '1' location.
    - `recolor(3, ...)`: Change the color of the shifted indices to '3'.
3. **Merge and paint:** Merge all the shifted and recolored plus-shapes and paint them onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for loc in ofcolor(I, 1):
    for i, j in frozenset({(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)}):
      if 0 <= loc[0] + i < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] + j < len(I[0]):
        I = fill(I, 3, frozenset({(loc[0] + i, loc[1] + j)}))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested loops for explicit iteration:

1. **Iterate through '1' locations:** `for loc in ofcolor(I, 1)`
2. **Iterate through plus-shape indices:** `for i, j in ...`
3. **Boundary check:** Ensure the shifted indices are within the grid boundaries.
4. **Fill:** If within bounds, fill the corresponding cell with '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def make_plus(loc):
  return recolor(3, shift(frozenset({(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)}), loc))

def solve(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(make_plus, ofcolor(I, 1))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version extracts the plus-shape creation into a separate function:

1. **`make_plus(loc)`:** Takes a location and returns a plus-shape object centered at that location with color '3'.
2. **Apply and merge:** The `solve` function applies `make_plus` to every '1' location and merges the resulting plus-shapes.
3. **Paint:** Finally, it paints the merged plus-shapes onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def paint_plus(grid, loc):
    for i, j in frozenset({(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)}):
      if 0 <= loc[0] + i < len(grid) and 0 <= loc[1] + j < len(grid[0]):
        grid = fill(grid, 3, frozenset({(loc[0] + i, loc[1] + j)}))
    return grid

  for loc in ofcolor(I, 1):
    I = paint_plus(I, loc)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a nested function for painting the plus shape:

1. **`paint_plus(grid, loc)`:** Takes a grid and a location. It iterates through the plus-shape indices, performs boundary checks, and fills the corresponding cells with '3'.
2. **Iterate and paint:** The `solve` function iterates through '1' locations and calls `paint_plus` for each, updating the grid iteratively.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches using the DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation. They demonstrate different levels of code abstraction, function composition, and iteration techniques, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
