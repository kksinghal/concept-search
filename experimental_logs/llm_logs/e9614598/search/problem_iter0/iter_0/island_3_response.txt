## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation identifies the horizontal position of the '1's in the input grid. It then draws a horizontal line of '3's in the output grid, centered at the same position as the '1's and with a length of 3.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as above. It finds the horizontal position of the '1's and draws a centered horizontal line of '3's in the output grid. 

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, False, True)
  if obj:
    j = leftmost(extract(obj, lambda x: True))
    line = frozenset({(j-1, 4), (j, 4), (j+1, 4)})
    O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, line)
  else:
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid ('I'), considering only directly connected cells of the same value and excluding the background.
2. **`if obj:`:**  Proceeds if any objects are found.
3. **`j = leftmost(extract(obj, lambda x: True))`:** Finds the leftmost column index ('j') of any object found.
4. **`line = frozenset({(j-1, 4), (j, 4), (j+1, 4)})`:** Creates a set of indices representing a horizontal line of length 3, centered at column 'j' and row 4.
5. **`O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, line)`:**  Creates an output grid ('O') of the same size as the input, filled with 0s, and then fills the 'line' indices with the value '3'.
6. **`else: O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:** If no objects are found, creates an output grid filled with 0s.
7. **`return O`:**  Returns the generated output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices_one = ofcolor(I, 1)
  if indices_one:
    j = leftmost(indices_one)
    O = fill(I, 3, {(4, j-1), (4, j), (4, j+1)})
  else:
    O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`indices_one = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Finds the indices of all cells in the input grid ('I') with the value '1'.
2. **`if indices_one:`:** Proceeds if any '1's are found.
3. **`j = leftmost(indices_one)`:**  Gets the smallest column index ('j') where a '1' is present.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, {(4, j-1), (4, j), (4, j+1)})`:** Creates an output grid ('O') by filling the input grid at indices representing a horizontal line of length 3 centered at column 'j' and row 4 with the value '3'. 
5. **`else: O = I`:** If no '1's are found, the output grid is the same as the input.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the generated output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    if index(I, (4, j)) == 1:
      return fill(O, 3, {(4, j-1), (4, j), (4, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates an output grid ('O') of the same size as the input, filled with 0s.
2. **`for j in range(width(I))`:** Iterates through each column ('j') of the input grid.
3. **`if index(I, (4, j)) == 1:`:** Checks if the cell at row 4 and column 'j' in the input grid is '1'.
4. **`return fill(O, 3, {(4, j-1), (4, j), (4, j+1)})`:**  If a '1' is found, fills the output grid at indices representing a horizontal line of length 3 centered at column 'j' and row 4 with the value '3' and returns the grid.
5. **`return O`:** If no '1' is found in the entire row, returns the output grid filled with 0s.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for j in range(width(I)):
    if I[4][j] == 1:
      O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, {(4, j-1), (4, j), (4, j+1)})
      return O
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for j in range(width(I))`:** Iterates through each column ('j') of the input grid.
2. **`if I[4][j] == 1:`:**  Checks if the cell at row 4 and column 'j' in the input grid is '1'.
3. **`O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, {(4, j-1), (4, j), (4, j+1)})`:** If a '1' is found, creates an output grid ('O') of the same size as the input, filled with 0s. It then fills the output grid at indices representing a horizontal line of length 3 centered at column 'j' and row 4 with the value '3'. 
4. **`return O`:** Returns the generated output grid.
5. **`return I`:** If no '1' is found in the entire row, returns the original input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj = objects(I, True, False, True)
    if obj:
        center_j = centerofmass(extract(obj, lambda x: True))[1]
        O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, {(4, center_j-1), (4, center_j), (4, center_j+1)})
    else:
        O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid ('I'), considering only directly connected cells of the same value and excluding the background.
2. **`if obj:`:** Proceeds if any objects are found.
3. **`center_j = centerofmass(extract(obj, lambda x: True))[1]`:** Calculates the horizontal center of mass ('center_j') of any found object.
4. **`O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 3, {(4, center_j-1), (4, center_j), (4, center_j+1)})`:** Creates an output grid ('O') of the same size as the input, filled with 0s, and then fills the indices representing a horizontal line of length 3 centered at column 'center_j' and row 4 with the value '3'.
5. **`else: O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:** If no objects are found, creates an output grid filled with 0s.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the generated output grid.


Each version uses a different combination of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diversity in problem-solving.
