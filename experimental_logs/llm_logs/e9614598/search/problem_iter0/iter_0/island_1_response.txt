## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes all the '1' digits in the input grid and creates a plus (+) shape centered at those locations using the digit '3'. 

* **Input_0:**  The single '1' digit at the center generates a plus shape of '3's around it.
* **Input_1:** The two '1' digits, both horizontally and vertically aligned, each generate their own plus shapes.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
    # Find the indices of the digit '1'
    ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)  
    # Generate a plus shape indices for each '1' index
    pluses = mapply(lambda x: frozenset({(x[0]-1, x[1]), (x[0]+1, x[1]), (x[0], x[1]-1), (x[0], x[1]+1)}), ones) 
    # Merge all the plus shapes into a single set of indices
    merged_pluses = merge(pluses) 
    # Fill the input grid with '3' at the plus shape indices
    O = fill(I, THREE, merged_pluses) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1's:** Locate all occurrences of the digit '1' within the input grid.
2. **Generate Plus Shapes:** For each '1' location, generate indices corresponding to a plus shape centered at that location.
3. **Merge Indices:** Combine all the plus shape indices into a single set.
4. **Fill Grid:**  Modify the input grid by placing the digit '3' at all the indices within the merged plus shape set.

### Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find objects with color '1'
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  # Shift each object up, down, left, and right by 1 unit 
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset({shift(obj, direction) for direction in {UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}}), objs)
  # Recolor the shifted objects to '3'
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), shifted_objs)
  # Merge all shifted and recolored objects
  merged_objs = merge(recolored_objs)
  # Paint the merged objects onto the original grid
  O = paint(I, merged_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identify connected components (objects) within the grid consisting of the digit '1'.
2. **Shift Objects:** Create four copies of each object, shifted one unit up, down, left, and right, respectively.
3. **Recolor Objects:** Change the color of all the shifted objects to the digit '3'.
4. **Merge and Paint:**  Combine all the shifted and recolored objects and paint them onto the original input grid.


### Version 3: 

```python
def solve(I):
  # Extract all '1' cells as an object
  ones_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)
  # Generate plus shape around each cell of the object
  plus_objs = mapply(lambda cell: shift(recolor(THREE, {(THREE, (0,0))}), cell[1]), ones_obj) 
  # Merge all plus shape objects
  merged_objs = merge(plus_objs)
  # Paint the merged objects onto the original grid
  O = paint(I, merged_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '1' Cells:** Identify and group all cells containing the digit '1' into a single object.
2. **Generate Plus Objects:** For each cell within the '1' object, create a new object representing a plus shape centered at that cell's location.
3. **Merge and Paint:** Merge all the generated plus shape objects and paint them onto the original input grid.

### Version 4:

```python
def solve(I):
    # Find indices of digit '1'
    one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    # Create a set of shifted indices for each direction
    shifted_indices = merge([shift(one_indices, direction) for direction in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]])
    # Combine original and shifted indices
    all_indices = one_indices | shifted_indices
    # Fill the grid with '3' at the combined indices
    O = fill(I, THREE, all_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** Find all indices in the grid containing the digit '1'.
2. **Shift Indices:**  Generate four sets of indices by shifting the original '1' indices up, down, left, and right.
3. **Combine Indices:** Create a final set containing both the original '1' indices and all the shifted indices.
4. **Fill Grid:**  Modify the input grid by placing the digit '3' at all indices present in the combined set. 

### Version 5:

```python
def solve(I):
    # Define a function to create a plus shape around a given index
    def make_plus(idx): 
        i, j = idx
        return frozenset({(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)})
    # Find all indices of digit '1'
    ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    # Generate plus shapes for each '1' index and merge them
    plus_indices = merge(apply(make_plus, ones))
    # Fill the input grid with '3' at the plus shape indices
    O = fill(I, THREE, plus_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Plus Function:** Create a helper function (`make_plus`) that takes an index and returns a set of indices representing a plus shape centered at that index.
2. **Locate '1's:** Find all indices containing the digit '1'.
3. **Generate and Merge Pluses:** Apply the `make_plus` function to each '1' index, generating plus shape indices. Then, merge all the generated indices.
4. **Fill Grid:** Modify the input grid by placing the digit '3' at all indices within the merged plus shape set.
