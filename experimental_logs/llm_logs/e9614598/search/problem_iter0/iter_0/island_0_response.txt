## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify objects (connected regions of the same digit) and paint a 3x3 square with the object's color, centered on the object's location. 

**Input_0:**

* There are two '1' objects.
* For each object, a 3x3 square of '3's is drawn, centered on the '1'.

**Input_1:**

* There are two '1' objects.
* Similar to Input_0, 3x3 squares of '3's are painted centered on each '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct programs achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    square = {(center_i - 1 + i, center_j - 1 + j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)}
    O = fill(O, THREE, square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all connected regions of the same color, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Paint:**  The code iterates through each object. For each object:
    * **Find Center:** `centerofmass(obj)` calculates the object's center.
    * **Create Square:** A set of indices representing a 3x3 square centered at the object's center is generated. 
    * **Fill Square:** `fill(O, THREE, square)` paints the square with the value '3' on the grid. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    if len(obj) > 0:
      ci, cj = center(obj)
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(THREE, {(i,j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)}), (ci-1,cj-1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Foreground:** `fgpartition(I)` divides the grid into objects, excluding the background.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input.
3. **Iterate and Paint:**
    * **Find Center:**  `center(obj)` determines the center of each object.
    * **Create and Shift Square:** A 3x3 square is created and shifted to be centered on the object.
    * **Recolor and Paint:** The square is recolored to '3' and painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, width(I)-1):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i-1+k,j-1+l) for k in range(3) for l in range(3)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** This version directly iterates over each cell in the grid, excluding the borders.
2. **Check for Non-Zero:** If a cell is not '0' (meaning it's part of an object):
   * **Fill Square:** It fills a 3x3 square centered at that cell with the value '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def paint_square(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return {(i-1+k,j-1+l) for k in range(3) for l in range(3)}
  
  nonzero_indices = ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I)-1)
  squares = mapply(paint_square, nonzero_indices)
  O = fill(I, THREE, squares)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `paint_square`:** A helper function to generate indices for a 3x3 square around a given location.
2. **Find Non-Zero Indices:** `ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I)-1)` identifies the indices of all non-background cells, assuming the background color is the most frequent. 
3. **Generate Squares:** `mapply(paint_square, nonzero_indices)` applies the helper function to each non-zero index, creating a set of squares.
4. **Fill Squares:** `fill(I, THREE, squares)` paints all identified squares with '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(ul[0]-1+i, ul[1]-1+j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects:** Similar to version 1, it finds and iterates through objects.
2. **Find Upper-Left Corner:**  `ulcorner(obj)` gets the upper-left corner of each object.
3. **Fill Square:** It calculates the indices for a 3x3 square based on the upper-left corner and fills it with '3'.
