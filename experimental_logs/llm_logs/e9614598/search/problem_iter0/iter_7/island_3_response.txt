## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' in the input grid and drawing a horizontal line of '3's centered on the object's center of mass, extending one cell to the left and right. 

**Let's break it down:**

1. **Object Identification:** The code needs to identify connected components of the digit '1' within the input grid. 
2. **Center of Mass Calculation:** For each identified object, the code needs to calculate the center of mass.
3. **Horizontal Line Drawing:**  A horizontal line of '3's, three cells wide, needs to be drawn on the output grid. This line should be centered on the object's center of mass.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    start_j = max(0, center_j - 1)
    end_j = min(width(I) - 1, center_j + 1)
    for j in range(start_j, end_j + 1):
      O = fill(O, 3, {(center_i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** It creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** It iterates through each object (connected component of '1's) found in the input grid.
3. **Calculate Line Coordinates:** It calculates the center of mass (`center_i`, `center_j`) and determines the start and end column indices (`start_j`, `end_j`) for the horizontal line.
4. **Draw Line:** It draws the horizontal line of '3's by iterating through the calculated column indices and filling the corresponding cells in the output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, max(0, j - 1))})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, min(width(I) - 1, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  It initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** It iterates through each object in the input.
3. **Draw Line:** For each object, it directly fills the three cells forming the horizontal line with '3's, ensuring it stays within the grid boundaries.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    line = canvas(3, (1, 3))
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(line), (i, max(0, j - 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** It creates an empty output canvas `O`.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** It iterates through each object in the input.
3. **Create and Position Line:** For each object, it creates a 1x3 grid `line` filled with '3's. It then shifts this line to the correct position based on the object's center of mass, handling boundary conditions.
4. **Paint Line:** It paints the shifted line onto the output canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    line_indices = {(i, max(0, j - 1)), (i, j), (i, min(width(I) - 1, j + 1))}
    O = fill(O, 3, line_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  It initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** It iterates through each object in the input.
3. **Calculate and Fill Line:**  For each object, it calculates the indices of the three cells that make up the line and directly fills those cells in the output grid with '3's.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1:
        obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda x: (i, j) in toindices(x))
        center_i, _ = centerofmass(obj)
        O = fill(O, 3, {(center_i, max(0, j - 1)), (center_i, j), (center_i, min(width(I) - 1, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** It creates an empty output canvas `O`.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:** It iterates through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Find Object and Draw Line:** If a cell contains '1', it finds the corresponding object, calculates its center of mass, and draws the horizontal line on the output grid. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages different function combinations and logic to achieve the desired outcome.
