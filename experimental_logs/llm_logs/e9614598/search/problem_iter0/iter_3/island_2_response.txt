## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying isolated cells of value '1' and creating a plus-shaped formation centered on these cells using the value '3'. 

**Input_0:** 
- Two isolated '1' cells exist.
- Two plus-shaped formations of '3' are created, each centered on a '1' cell.

**Input_1:**
- Two isolated '1' cells exist.
- Two plus-shaped formations of '3' are created, each centered on a '1' cell.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  # Find indices of '1's in the grid.
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  # Create a set to store indices for '3's.
  threes = set()
  # Iterate over each '1' index.
  for one in ones:
    # Add indices surrounding the '1' to form a plus shape.
    threes.update({(one[0]-1, one[1]), (one[0]+1, one[1]), (one[0], one[1]-1), (one[0], one[1]+1)})
  # Fill the grid with '3's at the calculated indices.
  O = fill(I, 3, frozenset(threes)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1.  **Identify '1' cells:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` locates indices of cells containing '1'.
2.  **Generate plus-shape indices:** For each '1' cell, the indices of its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) are added to the `threes` set.
3.  **Fill the grid:** The `fill` function places '3's at the indices stored in the `threes` set, effectively drawing the plus shapes around the '1' cells.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  # Find objects in the input grid with no background removal.
  objects = partition(I)
  # Filter objects that are single cells with value '1'.
  target_objects = sizefilter(objects, 1) & colorfilter(objects, 1) 
  # Create a set to store indices for '3's.
  plus_indices = set()
  # Iterate over each target object.
  for obj in target_objects:
    # Get the index of the object (single cell in this case).
    i, j = first(toindices(obj))
    # Add neighboring indices to form a plus shape.
    plus_indices.update({(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)})
  # Fill the input grid with '3' at the calculated plus shape indices.
  O = fill(I, 3, frozenset(plus_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1.  **Identify '1' cells as objects:** `partition(I)` identifies all objects in the grid, and subsequent filtering isolates single-cell objects with value '1'.
2. **Generate plus-shape indices:** Similar to Version 1, neighboring indices are added to `plus_indices`.
3. **Fill the grid:** `fill` places '3's at the calculated indices.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  # Create a new grid filled with 0s, same size as input.
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Iterate over rows and columns of the input grid.
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      # If a cell contains '1', paint a plus shape around it with '3's.
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
          # Boundary checks to avoid going out of the grid.
          if 0 <= i+di < len(I) and 0 <= j+dj < len(I[0]): 
            O = paint(O, {(3, (i+di, j+dj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create an empty canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` generates a grid of 0s with the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate and paint:** The code iterates through each cell, and if it finds a '1', it directly paints a plus shape around it on the new canvas using nested loops and boundary checks.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  # Define a lambda function to check if an index is within the grid boundaries.
  in_bounds = lambda i, j: 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0])
  # Get indices of all '1's in the input grid.
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  # Generate plus-shaped indices around each '1' using list comprehension and filtering.
  plus_indices = frozenset({(i + di, j + dj) for i, j in one_indices for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)] if in_bounds(i + di, j + dj)})
  # Fill the input grid with '3' at the calculated plus shape indices.
  O = fill(I, 3, plus_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Boundary check function:** A lambda function `in_bounds` improves code readability for boundary checks.
2. **Concise plus-shape generation:** List comprehension efficiently generates potential plus-shape indices, which are then filtered using the `in_bounds` function.
3. **Fill the grid:**  `fill` places '3's at the valid plus-shape indices.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
    # Find all objects in the grid.
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    # Filter objects that are single cell '1's.
    one_cells = sizefilter(objs, 1) & colorfilter(objs, 1)
    # Create a function to generate plus shape indices around a given index.
    make_plus = lambda i, j: {(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)}
    # Generate plus indices around each '1' cell using mapply and merge.
    plus_indices = mapply(lambda obj: make_plus(*first(toindices(obj))), one_cells)
    # Fill the grid with '3' at the generated plus indices.
    O = fill(I, 3, plus_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Object-based processing:** `objects` identifies single-cell '1' objects.
2. **Plus-shape function:**  `make_plus` lambda function enhances code modularity.
3. **`mapply` for efficiency:** `mapply` applies `make_plus` to each '1' object and merges the resulting indices efficiently. 
4. **Fill the grid:** `fill` places '3's at the generated indices.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing different DSL functions and logical structures.
