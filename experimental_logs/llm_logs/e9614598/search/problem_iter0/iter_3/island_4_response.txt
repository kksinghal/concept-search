## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves identifying the single object (connected pixels with the same value) in the input grid. A 3x3 square of color '3' is then painted onto the grid, centered on the object's location. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to the previous transformation, a 3x3 square of color '3' is centered on the location of each object in the input grid. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    centers = apply(centerofmass, objs)
    square = canvas(3, (3, 3))
    shifted_squares = mapply(lambda c: shift(asobject(square), subtract(c, (1, 1))), centers)
    O = paint(I, shifted_squares)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected objects in the input grid.
2. **Find Centers:** `apply(centerofmass, objs)` calculates the center of mass for each object.
3. **Create Square:** `canvas(3, (3, 3))` generates a 3x3 grid filled with the value '3'.
4. **Shift Squares:** For each object center, the 3x3 square is shifted so its own center aligns with the object's center.
5. **Paint Squares:** `paint(I, shifted_squares)` paints the shifted squares onto the input grid, creating the output.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    for i in range(center_i - 1, center_i + 2):
      for j in range(center_j - 1, center_j + 2):
        if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]):
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** The program iterates through each object found in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Center:**  The center of mass of the current object is calculated.
3. **Paint Square:** A 3x3 square is iteratively painted around the center of the object. 
4. **Boundary Check:**  Ensures that the painting stays within the grid boundaries.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  square_indices = frozenset({(i, j) for i in range(-1, 2) for j in range(-1, 2)})
  shifted_indices = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: shift(square_indices, centerofmass(obj)))
  O = fill(I, 3, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Find all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Define Square Indices:** Create a set of indices representing the relative positions within a 3x3 square centered at (0, 0).
3. **Shift and Merge:** For each object, shift the square indices to its center and merge them into a single set.
4. **Fill Grid:**  Fill the input grid with '3' at the calculated indices.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_square(obj):
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    return frozenset((3, (i, j)) for i in range(center_i - 1, center_i + 2) for j in range(center_j - 1, center_j + 2) if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]))

  painted_squares =  mapply(paint_square, objects(I, True, False, False))
  O = paint(I, painted_squares)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** `paint_square` takes an object as input and returns a set of cells representing a 3x3 square filled with '3', centered on the object.
2. **Apply and Paint:** The `paint_square` function is applied to each object in the grid, and the resulting squares are painted onto the input grid.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def paint_at(loc):
        i, j = loc
        return frozenset({(3, (i + di, j + dj)) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2)})

    object_cells = merge(objects(I, True, False, False))
    indices_to_paint = mapply(paint_at, apply(lambda cell: cell[1], object_cells))
    O = paint(I, indices_to_paint)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** `paint_at` takes a location (i, j) and generates a set of cells representing a 3x3 square centered at that location, filled with '3'.
2. **Extract Object Cells:** Extract all cells belonging to objects in the grid.
3. **Generate Painting Indices:** Apply the `paint_at` function to each cell's location and merge the results.
4. **Paint Grid:** Paint the input grid with '3' at all calculated indices.
