## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the locations of the digit '1' in the input grid and drawing a horizontal line of '3's centered on those locations, extending three cells wide. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** There are two '1's, one at (4, 1) and the other at (4, 7). The output has a line of three '3's centered on these column indices in row 4.
* **Input_1:**  There are two '1's, one at (0, 3) and the other at (8, 3). The output has a line of three '3's centered on these column indices in their respective rows.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    j = leftmost(obj)
    line = frozenset({(i, j-1) for i in range(10)} | {(i, j) for i in range(10)} | {(i, j+1) for i in range(10)})
    O = fill(O, 3, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies objects formed by the digit '1' using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input grid using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
3. **Iterate and Draw:** Iterates through each object (which represents a '1' digit) and gets the leftmost column index (`j`) of the object. It then creates a vertical line of three cells wide centered at the '1's column index using `frozenset` and `range`. Finally, it fills these cells with '3' on the canvas using `fill`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, j in indices:
    for k in range(j-1, j+2):
      if 0 <= k < len(I[0]):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Indices:** It identifies the indices of all cells containing '1' using `ofcolor(I, 1)`.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input using `canvas`.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates through the indices, and for each '1', it fills a three-cell wide horizontal line centered at that '1' with the value '3', checking for boundary conditions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        for k in range(max(0, j-1), min(j+2, len(I[0]))):
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** It iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check for '1':** If a cell contains '1', it identifies a three-cell wide horizontal range centered at that cell, ensuring to stay within the grid boundaries.
3. **Fill with '3':** It fills the identified range with the value '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(3,  frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(max(0, j-1), min(j+2, len(row)))})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** It iterates through each cell, and if it finds a '1', it creates a horizontal line of '3's centered on that '1's location and paints it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  H, W = shape(I)
  O = canvas(0, (H,W))
  for i in range(H):
    for j in range(W):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        for dj in range(-1, 2):
          if 0 <= j + dj < W:
            O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j + dj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Grid Dimensions:** It retrieves the height and width of the input grid.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas of the same size.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates through each cell, and if it finds a '1', it fills a horizontal line of three cells centered at that cell with '3', while ensuring it stays within the grid boundaries.


Each version uses slightly different logic or DSL function combinations, offering a diverse set of solutions to achieve the same transformation.
