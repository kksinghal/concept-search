## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects within the input grid and relocating them to new positions on an empty canvas. The objects are defined by their color and shape.  

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Identification:** A '+' shaped object formed by the digit '3' is identified.
2. **Canvas Creation:** A new canvas filled with '0's and the same dimensions as the input grid is created.
3. **Object Relocation:** The '+' shaped object is moved to a new position on the canvas. The new position seems to be related to the original position but the exact logic is not immediately clear.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one, but with a different input grid and a slightly different '+' shaped object (rotated by 90 degrees).

## Code Generation:

Based on the transformation analysis and the provided DSL functions, here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # 1. Object Identification
    obj = extract(objects(I, True, True, False), lambda obj: size(obj) == 5) 
    # 2. Canvas Creation
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    # 3. Object Relocation
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, subtract((4,4), ulcorner(obj))))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Object Identification:** 
    *   `objects(I, True, True, False)`: Identifies all objects in the grid.
    *   `lambda obj: size(obj) == 5`: Defines a condition to find the object with size 5 (the '+').
    *   `extract(...)`: Extracts the '+' shaped object.

2.  **Canvas Creation:**
    *   `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`: Creates a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with '0's.

3.  **Object Relocation:**
    *   `ulcorner(obj)`:  Gets the upper-left corner coordinates of the '+'.
    *   `subtract((4,4), ulcorner(obj))`:  Calculates the offset to move the '+' to position (4,4).
    *   `shift(obj, ...)`:  Moves the object by the calculated offset.
    *   `paint(O, ...)`:  Paints the moved object onto the canvas.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # 1. Object Identification
    obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: square(obj) and size(obj) == 5)
    # 2. Canvas Creation
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    # 3. Object Relocation
    center_offset = subtract((4, 4), centerofmass(obj))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, center_offset))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Object Identification:**
    *   Uses `square(obj)`  to specifically check for square shapes, ensuring it only captures a '+' shape and not other 5-celled objects.

2.  **Canvas Creation:**
    *   Same as Version 1.

3.  **Object Relocation:**
    *   `centerofmass(obj)`:  Calculates the center of the '+'.
    *   `subtract((4, 4), ...)`: Calculates the offset to move the '+' center to (4,4).
    *   The rest is identical to Version 1.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # 1. Object Identification (assuming '3' is the object color)
    obj = extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == THREE and size(obj) == 5)
    # 2. Canvas Creation
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    # 3. Object Relocation
    new_ulcorner = (4 - height(obj)//2, 4 - width(obj)//2)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, subtract(new_ulcorner, ulcorner(obj))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Object Identification:**
    *   Uses `partition(I)` to split the grid into objects based on color.
    *   Directly checks for the color '3' using `color(obj) == THREE`.

2.  **Canvas Creation:**
    *   Same as Version 1.

3.  **Object Relocation:**
    *   `new_ulcorner`:  Calculates the new upper-left corner position to center the '+' around (4,4) 
    *   The rest is similar to previous versions, but uses the calculated `new_ulcorner` for the shift. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # 1. Object Identification 
    obj = extract(objects(I, True, True, False), lambda obj: size(obj) == 5)
    # 2. Canvas Creation and Relocation in one step
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(obj, (4 - uppermost(obj) - 2, 4 - leftmost(obj) - 2)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

*   This version combines canvas creation and object relocation into a single line for conciseness.
*   The calculation for the shift offset is directly embedded within the `paint` function. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # 1. Object Identification (find all '3's)
  threes = ofcolor(I, THREE) 
  # 2. Check if a '+' shape exists
  if size(threes) != 5 or not all(dneighbors(loc) <= threes for loc in threes):
    return I # No change if not a '+' shape 
  # 3. Canvas Creation
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  # 4. Object Relocation (placing top-left at (3,3))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(THREE, threes), (3, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*   This version first checks if a valid '+' shape exists before proceeding.
*   It uses `ofcolor` to find all cells with '3' and then verifies if they form the desired shape.
*   `recolor(THREE, threes)` is used to convert the found indices back into an object representation before shifting and painting. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the transformation task using the provided DSL. Each version offers unique logic and function combinations, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
