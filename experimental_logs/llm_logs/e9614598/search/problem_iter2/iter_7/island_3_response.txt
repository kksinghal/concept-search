## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

The transformation identifies the cell containing the least frequent non-space character in the input grid ('1' in this case). In the output grid, a plus (+) shape centered on this cell is drawn using the character '3'. 

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

Similar to the first transformation, this one also identifies the cell containing the least frequent non-space character in the input grid ('1' in this case). The output grid is then modified to draw a plus (+) shape centered on this cell using the character '3'.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  char_counts = {}
  for row in grid:
    for char in row:
      if char != ' ':
        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1
  target_char = min(char_counts, key=char_counts.get)
  target_loc = next((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(grid) for j, c in enumerate(row) if c == target_char)
  output_grid = canvas('0', shape(grid))
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0] + i, target_loc[1]) for i in range(-1, 2, 2)})
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0], target_loc[1] + j) for j in range(-1, 2, 2)})
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Character:**  The code iterates through the input grid to find the least frequent non-space character and its location.
2. **Create Canvas:** A new grid filled with '0's is created with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Draw Plus Shape:**  Using the `fill` function, the '3' character is painted onto the canvas to form a plus shape centered on the target character's location.
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid with the plus shape is returned.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  target_char = min({c for row in grid for c in row if c != ' '}, key=lambda c: sum([row.count(c) for row in grid]))
  target_loc = next((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(grid) for j, c in enumerate(row) if c == target_char)
  output_grid = [['0' for _ in range(len(grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(grid))]
  for i in range(-1, 2, 2):
    output_grid[target_loc[0] + i][target_loc[1]] = '3'
  for j in range(-1, 2, 2):
    output_grid[target_loc[0]][target_loc[1] + j] = '3'
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in output_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Character:** The code uses a set comprehension and the `min` function to find the least frequent non-space character in the input grid.
2. **Find Target Location:**  The code iterates through the grid to find the coordinates of the target character.
3. **Create Canvas:** A new grid filled with '0's is created using list comprehension.
4. **Draw Plus Shape:** The '3' character is directly assigned to the cells forming a plus shape around the target character's location.
5. **Return Output:** The modified grid, converted to tuples, is returned.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  flattened = [c for row in grid for c in row if c != ' ']
  target_char = leastcommon(flattened)
  target_loc = next((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(grid) for j, c in enumerate(row) if c == target_char)
  output_grid = canvas('0', shape(grid))
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', connect(subtract(target_loc, (1, 0)), add(target_loc, (1, 0))))
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', connect(subtract(target_loc, (0, 1)), add(target_loc, (0, 1))))
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Character:** The input grid is flattened, and the `leastcommon` function is used to find the target character.
2. **Find Target Location:**  The location of the target character is found by iterating through the grid.
3. **Create Canvas:**  A new grid filled with '0's is created.
4. **Draw Plus Shape:** The `connect` function draws horizontal and vertical lines (using the '3' character) centered on the target location using vector addition and subtraction. 
5. **Return Output:**  The modified grid with the plus shape is returned. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  target_char = leastcommon([c for row in grid for c in row if c != ' '])
  target_row = next(i for i, row in enumerate(grid) for c in row if c == target_char)
  target_col = next(j for j, c in enumerate(grid[target_row]) if c == target_char)
  output_grid = canvas('0', shape(grid))
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_row + i, target_col) for i in range(-1, 2, 2)})
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_row, target_col + j) for j in range(-1, 2, 2)})
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Character:**  Similar to Version 3, this version flattens the grid and uses `leastcommon` to find the target character.
2. **Find Target Location:** This version finds the target's row and column separately using nested `next` functions.
3. **Create Canvas:** A new grid with '0's is created.
4. **Draw Plus Shape:** Similar to Version 1, this version uses `fill` to draw the plus shape centered on the target location.
5. **Return Output:**  The modified grid is returned.

**Program Version 5** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  non_space_chars = list({c for row in grid for c in row if c != ' '})
  char_counts = [(c, sum([row.count(c) for row in grid])) for c in non_space_chars]
  target_char = min(char_counts, key = lambda x: x[1])[0]
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, c in enumerate(row):
      if c == target_char:
        target_loc = (i, j)
        break
  output_grid = canvas('0', shape(grid))
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0] + i, target_loc[1]) for i in [-1, 0, 1]})
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0], target_loc[1] + j) for j in [-1, 0, 1]})
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Character:**  This version first creates a list of unique non-space characters. Then, it calculates the count of each unique character and finds the character with the minimum count.
2. **Find Target Location:** The code iterates through the grid and stores the location when the target character is found.
3. **Create Canvas:** A canvas filled with '0's is created.
4. **Draw Plus Shape:** Similar to other versions, this version uses the `fill` function to draw the plus shape centered at the target location. 
5. **Return Output:** The modified grid is returned.
