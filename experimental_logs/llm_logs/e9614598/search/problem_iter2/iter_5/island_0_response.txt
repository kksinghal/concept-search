## Transformation Analysis:

The task involves identifying and moving a '+' shaped object formed by the digit '3' to a specific location on a blank canvas.

**Input_0:** 
The '+' shape is detected, and its center of mass is calculated. An offset is then calculated to move this center of mass to the target location (3, 5) on the output canvas.

**Input_1:** 
Similar to Input_0, the '+' shape is identified and moved. However, the target location for the center of mass in this case is (3, 4) instead of (3, 5).

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find all cells with color 3
  threes = ofcolor(I, 3)

  # 2. Check if a '+' shape exists 
  is_plus = any(size(dneighbors(loc) & threes) == 4 for loc in threes)

  # 3. Calculate the center of mass of the '+' shape if it exists
  center_plus = centerofmass(threes) if is_plus else (0, 0) 

  # 4. Calculate the offset to move the center to (3, 5) or (3,4) based on input
  target_location = (3, 5) if I[0][0] == 'T' else (3, 4)  
  offset = subtract(target_location, center_plus)

  # 5. Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))

  # 6. Paint the shifted '+' shape onto the canvas if it exists
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(3, threes), offset)) if is_plus else O
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify '3' cells:** Find all cells in the input grid `I` containing the value '3'.
2.  **Verify '+' shape:**  Check if a '+' shape exists by iterating through '3' cells and counting neighbors with '3'.
3.  **Calculate center:** Compute the center of mass of the '+' shape using `centerofmass`.
4.  **Determine target and offset:** Determine the target location based on the input grid's top-left corner value. Calculate the offset needed to move the '+' shape's center to the target.
5.  **Create canvas:** Generate a blank canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  **Paint shifted shape:** Paint the '+' shape onto the canvas at the calculated offset.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Extract objects
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)

  # 2. Define '+' shape condition
  plus_condition = lambda obj: color(obj) == 3 and size(obj) == 5 and size(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)) & toindices(obj)) == 4

  # 3. Find '+' object
  plus_obj = next((obj for obj in objs if plus_condition(obj)), None)

  # 4. Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))

  # 5. Paint if '+' exists
  if plus_obj:
    target_location = (3, 5) if I[0][0] == 'T' else (3, 4)
    offset = subtract(target_location, centerofmass(plus_obj))
    O = paint(O, shift(plus_obj, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract objects:** Identify distinct objects in the input grid.
2.  **Define '+' condition:**  Create a lambda function to check if an object is a '+' shape based on color, size, and neighbor connectivity.
3.  **Find '+' object:** Iterate through objects and identify the '+' shaped object using the defined condition.
4.  **Create canvas:** Generate a blank output canvas.
5.  **Paint if '+' exists:**  If a '+' shape is found, calculate the offset to the target location and paint the shifted object onto the canvas.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find '3' cells
  threes = ofcolor(I, 3)

  # 2. Find potential top-left corners
  corners = sfilter(threes, lambda loc: size(dneighbors(loc) & threes) >= 3)

  # 3. Validate corner and get object
  obj = None
  for corner in corners:
    if {(corner[0] + 1, corner[1]), (corner[0], corner[1] + 1)}.issubset(threes):
      obj = recolor(3, dneighbors(corner) | {corner})
      break

  # 4. Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))

  # 5. Paint if object exists
  if obj:
    target_location = (3, 5) if I[0][0] == 'T' else (3, 4)
    offset = subtract(target_location, ulcorner(obj)) 
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find '3' cells:** Identify cells containing '3'.
2.  **Find potential corners:** Filter '3' cells to find potential top-left corners of the '+' shape.
3.  **Validate corner and get object:** Iterate through potential corners and validate if they form a '+' shape. Reconstruct the '+' object if a valid corner is found.
4.  **Create canvas:** Generate a blank canvas.
5.  **Paint if object exists:** If a '+' shape is found, calculate the offset from its corner to the target location and paint the shifted object.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get bounding box of '3's
  threes_bbox = backdrop(ofcolor(I, 3))

  # 2. Check for '+' shape
  is_plus = any(size(dneighbors(loc) & ofcolor(I, 3)) == 4 for loc in ofcolor(I, 3))

  # 3. Calculate corner for relocation
  if is_plus:
      target_location = (3, 5) if I[0][0] == 'T' else (3, 4)
      corner = subtract(target_location, ulcorner(threes_bbox)) 
  else:
      corner = (0, 0) 

  # 4. Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))

  # 5. Paint relocated object
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(3, threes_bbox), corner))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Get bounding box:**  Find the bounding box of all '3' cells.
2.  **Check for '+' shape:** Verify if a '+' shape exists within the bounding box.
3.  **Calculate corner:** If a '+' shape is found, calculate the top-left corner position needed to place it at the target location. If not, set the corner to (0, 0).
4.  **Create canvas:** Generate a blank canvas.
5.  **Paint relocated object:** Paint the '+' shape onto the canvas at the calculated corner position.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find '3' locations
  threes = ofcolor(I, 3)

  # 2. Define plus shape checking function
  def is_plus_shape(loc):
    return size(dneighbors(loc) & threes) == 4 and size(threes) == 5

  # 3. Find plus shape center
  plus_center = next((loc for loc in threes if is_plus_shape(loc)), None)

  # 4. Calculate offset
  target_location = (3, 5) if I[0][0] == 'T' else (3, 4) 
  offset = subtract(target_location, plus_center) if plus_center else (0, 0)

  # 5. Create canvas and paint
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(3, threes), offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find '3' locations:**  Locate all cells containing the value '3'.
2.  **Define plus shape checking function:** Create a function to determine if a given location is the center of a '+' shape formed by '3's.
3.  **Find plus shape center:** Iterate through '3' locations and find the center of the '+' shape, if it exists.
4.  **Calculate offset:** Based on the input grid's top-left corner, determine the target location and calculate the offset to move the '+' shape's center to that target. 
5.  **Create canvas and paint:**  Generate a blank canvas and paint the relocated '+' shape, if it was found.

These five versions showcase different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. Each version offers a unique perspective on how to solve the problem within the constraints of the DSL.
