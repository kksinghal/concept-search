## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a grid of characters as input and outputs a grid of digits. The transformation logic is as follows:

1. **Identify the Target:** Find the least frequent non-space character in the input grid. This character is the "target".
2. **Locate the Target:** Determine the row and column indices of the first occurrence of the target character.
3. **Create a Blank Canvas:** Generate an output grid filled with '0's, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. **Draw the Cross:**  In the output grid, draw a horizontal and vertical line of '3's centered at the target character's location. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using functions from the provided DSL (`dsl.py`):

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(input_string):
  # Convert string to grid
  grid = tuple(tuple(c for c in row) for row in input_string.split("\n"))

  # Find the least common non-space character
  char_counts = {}
  for row in grid:
    for char in row:
      if char != ' ':
        if char not in char_counts:
          char_counts[char] = 0
        char_counts[char] += 1
  target_char = min(char_counts, key=char_counts.get)

  # Find the target character's location
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, char in enumerate(row):
      if char == target_char:
        target_i, target_j = i, j
        break

  # Create a canvas of '0's
  output_grid = canvas('0', shape(grid))

  # Define a helper function for painting
  def paint_cell(i, j, val):
    h, w = len(output_grid), len(output_grid[0])
    if 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w:
      output_grid[i][j] = val

  # Paint the horizontal cross
  paint_cell(target_i, target_j, '3')
  paint_cell(target_i + 1, target_j, '3')
  paint_cell(target_i - 1, target_j, '3')
  paint_cell(target_i, target_j + 1, '3')
  paint_cell(target_i, target_j - 1, '3')

  # Convert grid back to string
  output_string = "\n".join(["".join(row) for row in output_grid])
  return output_string
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Convert to Grid:**  The input string is converted into a 2D grid of characters.
2.  **Find Target Character:** It iterates through the grid to identify the least frequent non-space character, storing counts in `char_counts`.
3.  **Locate Target:**  It finds the row (`target_i`) and column (`target_j`) of the first occurrence of the target character.
4.  **Create Canvas:**  A new grid (`output_grid`) filled with '0's is created, matching the input grid's shape.
5.  **Paint Cross:**  A helper function `paint_cell` safely paints a cell at given indices with a value, handling out-of-bounds errors. This function is used to draw the cross of '3's centered at the target's location.
6.  **Return String:**  The `output_grid` is converted back into a string representation.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(input_string):
  # Convert string to grid
  grid = tuple(tuple(c for c in row) for row in input_string.split("\n"))

  # Find the least common non-space character (using DSL functions)
  non_space_chars = set(merge(grid)) - {' '}
  target_char = argmin(non_space_chars, lambda c: sum([row.count(c) for row in grid]))

  # Find the target character's location
  target_i = extract(range(len(grid)), lambda i: target_char in grid[i])
  target_j = extract(range(len(grid[0])), lambda j: grid[target_i][j] == target_char)

  # Create a canvas of '0's
  output_grid = canvas('0', shape(grid))

  # Paint the horizontal cross (using DSL functions)
  indices_to_paint = frozenset({
      (target_i, target_j), 
      (target_i + 1, target_j), 
      (target_i - 1, target_j), 
      (target_i, target_j + 1), 
      (target_i, target_j - 1)
  })
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', indices_to_paint)

  # Convert grid back to string
  output_string = "\n".join(["".join(row) for row in output_grid])
  return output_string
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages more DSL functions for conciseness and efficiency:

1. **Finding Target Character:**  Uses `merge` to flatten the grid, creates a set of non-space characters, and uses `argmin` with a custom function to find the least frequent one.
2. **Locating Target:**  Employs `extract` with a lambda function to efficiently find the target's row and column.
3. **Painting the Cross:**  Directly uses `fill` with a set of pre-calculated indices to paint the cross.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(input_string):
  # Convert string to grid
  grid = tuple(tuple(c for c in row) for row in input_string.split("\n"))

  # Find the least common non-space character
  char_counts = {}
  for char in merge(grid):
    if char != ' ':
      char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1
  target_char = min(char_counts, key=char_counts.get)

  # Find the target character's location
  target_loc = extract(asindices(grid), lambda loc: grid[loc[0]][loc[1]] == target_char)

  # Create a canvas of '0's
  output_grid = canvas('0', shape(grid))

  # Paint the horizontal cross (using DSL functions)
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', dneighbors(target_loc) | {target_loc})

  # Convert grid back to string
  output_string = "\n".join(["".join(row) for row in output_grid])
  return output_string
```

**Explanation:**

This version further optimizes the code:

1. **Target Character Search:**  It simplifies the counting of characters and directly uses `min` to find the least frequent one.
2. **Locating Target:** Employs `asindices` to get all grid indices and uses `extract` with a lambda function to directly find the target's location.
3. **Painting Cross:**  It efficiently paints the cross using  `dneighbors` to get adjacent cells and combines it with the target's location using set union.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(input_string):
  # Convert string to grid
  grid = tuple(tuple(c for c in row) for row in input_string.split("\n"))

  # Find the least common non-space character
  chars = palette(grid) - {' '}
  target_char = argmin(chars, lambda c: colorcount(grid, c))

  # Find the target character's location
  target_loc = extract(asindices(grid), lambda loc: index(grid, loc) == target_char)

  # Create a canvas of '0's
  output_grid = canvas('0', shape(grid))

  # Paint the horizontal cross 
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0] + i, target_loc[1] + j) for i in [-1, 0, 1] for j in [-1, 0, 1] if abs(i) != abs(j)})

  # Convert grid back to string
  output_string = "\n".join(["".join(row) for row in output_grid])
  return output_string
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on more specialized DSL functions for clarity and conciseness:

1. **Target Character:** Utilizes `palette` to get unique grid characters and `argmin` with `colorcount` for efficient frequency-based selection.
2. **Locating Target:**  Employs `asindices` and `extract` with `index` for direct location finding.
3. **Painting the Cross:** Uses a set comprehension with concise logic for generating cross indices.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(input_string):
  # Convert string to grid
  grid = tuple(tuple(c for c in row) for row in input_string.split("\n"))

  # Find the least common non-space character 
  target_char = leastcommon(merge(sfilter(grid, lambda row: any(c != ' ' for c in row))))

  # Find the target character's location
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, char in enumerate(row):
      if char == target_char:
        target_loc = (i, j)
        break

  # Create a canvas of '0's
  output_grid = canvas('0', shape(grid))

  # Paint the horizontal cross 
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(3, (target_loc[0] + i, target_loc[1])) for i in [-1, 0, 1]})
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(3, (target_loc[0], target_loc[1] + j)) for j in [-1, 1]})

  # Convert grid back to string
  output_string = "\n".join(["".join(row) for row in output_grid])
  return output_string
```

**Explanation:**

This version prioritizes code readability and modularity:

1. **Finding Target Character:** Utilizes a combination of `sfilter`, `merge`, and `leastcommon` to find the least common non-space character in a readable manner.
2. **Locating Target:**  Uses a simple nested loop for clarity in finding the target's location.
3. **Painting the Cross:** Separates the horizontal and vertical line painting using `paint` for improved code structure.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to solving the transformation problem using the DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided functions.
