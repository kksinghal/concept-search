## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation isolates the object formed by the digit '3'. It then places this object on a blank canvas of '0's, shifting it three units down and three units right from its original position.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to the previous transformation, the object made of the digit '3' is extracted. This object is then placed on a canvas of '0's, but this time, it is shifted three units down and one unit right. 

## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated:**

**Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 3), I)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj, (3, 3))) if len(objects(I)) == 2 else paint(O, shift(obj, (3, 1))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object:** `obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 3), I)` extracts the object formed by the digit '3' from the input grid `I`.
2. **Create Canvas:**  `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a canvas `O` filled with '0's, matching the dimensions of the input grid.
3. **Conditional Shifting:**  
   - `if len(objects(I)) == 2` checks if there are only two objects in the input grid (including background). If true, it implies we're dealing with the transformation seen in Input_0 to Output_0.
   - If the condition is true, `paint(O, shift(obj, (3, 3)))` paints the extracted object onto the canvas, shifting it by (3, 3). 
   - If the condition is false, it implies the transformation of Input_1 to Output_1. In this case, `paint(O, shift(obj, (3, 1)))` is executed, shifting by (3, 1).
4. **Return:** The function returns the modified canvas `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_3 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 3), I)
  shift_amount = (3, 3) if ulcorner(obj_3) == (4, 5) else (3, 1) 
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj_3, shift_amount))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object:** `obj_3 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 3), I)` extracts the '3' object.
2. **Determine Shift:** `shift_amount = (3, 3) if ulcorner(obj_3) == (4, 5) else (3, 1)` calculates the shift amount based on the upper-left corner of the '3' object. If it's at (4, 5), it implies the first transformation, otherwise the second.
3. **Create and Paint Canvas:** `O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj_3, shift_amount))` creates the canvas, shifts the object, and paints it in a single line.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified canvas `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  target_corner = (7, 8) if len(objects(I)) == 2 else (7, 6)
  obj_3 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 3), I)
  shift_amount = subtract(target_corner, ulcorner(obj_3))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj_3, shift_amount))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Determine Target Corner:** `target_corner = (7, 8) if len(objects(I)) == 2 else (7, 6)` determines the target upper-left corner of the '3' object based on the number of objects in the input.
2. **Extract Object and Calculate Shift:** Similar to previous versions, it extracts the '3' object and calculates the required shift to place its corner at `target_corner`.
3. **Create and Paint Canvas:** Same as in Version 2.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified canvas `O`. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 3), I)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 3:
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i + 3, j + 3))}) if len(objects(I)) == 2 else paint(O, {(3, (i + 3, j + 1))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '3' Object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create Canvas:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Iterate and Paint:** It iterates through the input grid, and for each cell with '3', it paints a '3' on the output canvas at the appropriate shifted position based on the number of objects in the input grid.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified canvas `O`. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_3 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 3), I)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj_3, (3, 3)))
  return O if len(objects(I)) == 2 else paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj_3, (3, 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '3' Object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Apply First Transformation:** `O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj_3, (3, 3)))` applies the (3, 3) shift and paints on the canvas.
3. **Conditional Return:** 
   - If the input had two objects, the first transformation is correct, so it returns `O`.
   - If not, it applies the second transformation (3, 1 shift) on a new canvas and returns that.
