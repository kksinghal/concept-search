## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the least frequent non-space character in the input grid and draw a horizontally-oriented cross using the digit '3' centered on the least frequent character. The rest of the grid is filled with '0's. 

**Input 0:**

- Least frequent non-space character: '1'
- Cross is drawn centered on the '1'.

**Input 1:**

- Least frequent non-space character: '1'
- Cross is drawn centered on the '1'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by identifying objects and finding the least common color)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Find the least common non-space character
  target_char = leastcolor(objects(grid, True, True, True))
  
  # Find the target character's location
  target_loc = extract(asindices(grid), lambda loc: grid[loc[0]][loc[1]] == target_char)

  # Create a canvas of '0's
  output_grid = canvas('0', shape(grid))

  # Paint the horizontal cross
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0] + i, target_loc[1]) for i in range(-1, 2)})
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0], target_loc[1] + j) for j in [-1, 1]})

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(grid, True, True, True)` finds all objects in the grid, treating characters as colors.
2. **Least Common Character:** `leastcolor()` identifies the least frequent character from the objects.
3. **Find Location:** `extract()` and `asindices()` are used to locate the least frequent character in the grid.
4. **Canvas Creation:** A canvas of '0's is created using `canvas()` with the same dimensions as the input grid.
5. **Cross Drawing:** The cross is drawn using `fill()` by calculating the indices relative to the target character's location.

**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by direct character counting and manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Find the least common non-space character 
  char_counts = {}
  for row in grid:
    for char in row:
      if char != ' ':
        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1
  target_char = min(char_counts, key=char_counts.get)

  # Find the target character's location
  target_loc = next((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(grid) for j, c in enumerate(row) if c == target_char)

  # Create a canvas of '0's
  output_grid = canvas('0', (len(grid), len(grid[0])))

  # Paint the horizontal cross
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0] + i, target_loc[1]) for i in range(-1, 2)})
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0], target_loc[1] + j) for j in [-1, 1]})
  
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Character Counting:**  Iterate through the grid and count the occurrences of each non-space character.
2. **Find Least Common:**  Use `min(char_counts, key=char_counts.get)` to find the least common character.
3. **Locate Character:** Iterate again to find the coordinates (i, j) of the target character.
4. **Canvas & Cross:** Create a canvas of '0's and draw the cross using similar logic to version 1.

**Program Version 3:** (Using `prapply` for location finding)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Find the least common non-space character
  target_char = leastcommon(merge(sfilter(grid, lambda row: any(c != ' ' for c in row))))

  # Find the target character's location
  target_loc = extract(prapply(astuple, range(len(grid)), range(len(grid[0]))), lambda loc: grid[loc[0]][loc[1]] == target_char)

  # Create a canvas of '0's
  output_grid = canvas('0', (len(grid), len(grid[0])))

  # Paint the horizontal cross
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0] + i, target_loc[1]) for i in range(-1, 2)})
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0], target_loc[1] + j) for j in [-1, 1]})

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Least Common & Location:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **`prapply` for Coordinates:** Uses `prapply` to efficiently generate all possible grid coordinates and `extract` to find the target character's location.

**Program Version 4:** (Utilizing `argmin` for finding the least common character) 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the least common non-space character
  target_char = argmin(palette(I) - {' '}, lambda c: colorcount(I, c))

  # Find the target character's location
  target_loc = extract(prapply(astuple, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))), lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == target_char)

  # Create a canvas of '0's
  output_grid = canvas('0', (len(I), len(I[0])))

  # Paint the horizontal cross
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0] + i, target_loc[1]) for i in range(-1, 2)})
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(target_loc[0], target_loc[1] + j) for j in [-1, 1]})

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`argmin` for Least Common:**  Employs `argmin` and `colorcount` to identify the least frequent character more efficiently.
2. **Location & Cross Drawing:** Similar logic to previous versions.

**Program Version 5:** (Simplified cross drawing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Find the least common non-space character (same as version 2)
  # ...

  # Find the target character's location (same as version 2)
  # ...

  # Create a canvas of '0's
  output_grid = canvas('0', (len(grid), len(grid[0])))

  # Paint the horizontal cross (simplified)
  i, j = target_loc
  for di in range(-1, 2):
    for dj in range(-1, 2):
      if abs(di) != abs(dj): 
        new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= new_i < len(grid) and 0 <= new_j < len(grid[0]):
          output_grid = fill(output_grid, '3', {(new_i, new_j)})

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Least Common & Location:** Same as version 2.
2. **Simplified Cross:** Uses nested loops and `abs(di) != abs(dj)` to simplify the logic for drawing the cross.
