## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to draw a T-shape in the center of a 10x10 canvas and add two vertical lines based on the presence of the digit '3' in the input grid. 

* **T-Shape:** The T-shape always has the value '3' and occupies the same central position in all output grids.
* **Vertical Lines:** 
    * If the input grid contains the digit '3', the vertical lines are drawn at columns 2 and 8, spanning rows 5 and 6. 
    * If the input grid does not contain the digit '3', the vertical lines are drawn at columns 1 and 9, spanning rows 4 and 9. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Draw the T-shape
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 3, connect((4,3),(4,5)) | connect((3,4),(5,4)))
  # Check for the presence of '3' in the input
  is_three_present = 3 in set(v for r in I for v in r)
  # Draw the vertical lines based on the condition
  if is_three_present:
    O = fill(O, 1, {(1, 4), (8, 4), (1, 5), (8, 5)})
  else:
    O = fill(O, 1, {(0, 3), (8, 3), (0, 8), (8, 8)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **T-Shape Creation:** The code creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0' using `canvas(0, (10, 10))` and then fills a T-shape with '3' at the center using `fill` and `connect`.
2. **'3' Detection:** It checks for the presence of '3' in the input grid by flattening the grid and checking if '3' is present in the resulting set.
3. **Conditional Line Drawing:** Based on the presence of '3', it draws the vertical lines at the appropriate positions using `fill` and hardcoded coordinates.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Draw the T-shape
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 3, connect((4,3),(4,5)) | connect((3,4),(5,4)))
  # Define line locations based on '3' presence
  line_locations = {(1, 4), (8, 4), (1, 5), (8, 5)} if any(3 in r for r in I) else {(0, 3), (8, 3), (0, 8), (8, 8)}
  # Draw the vertical lines
  return fill(O, 1, line_locations)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **T-Shape Creation:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Conditional Line Location:** Uses a conditional expression to define the coordinates of the vertical lines based on the presence of '3'. It checks for '3' in each row of the input grid.
3. **Line Drawing:**  Draws the vertical lines using `fill` with the dynamically defined `line_locations`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define a function to draw lines based on condition
  def draw_lines(grid, is_three_present):
    if is_three_present:
      return fill(grid, 1, {(1, 4), (8, 4), (1, 5), (8, 5)})
    else:
      return fill(grid, 1, {(0, 3), (8, 3), (0, 8), (8, 8)})
  # Draw the T-shape
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 3, connect((4,3),(4,5)) | connect((3,4),(5,4)))
  # Draw the lines based on '3' presence
  return draw_lines(O, 3 in {v for r in I for v in r})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** Defines a helper function `draw_lines` that takes the grid and a boolean indicating the presence of '3' and draws the lines accordingly.
2. **T-Shape Creation:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Line Drawing with Helper:** Calls the `draw_lines` function to draw the vertical lines based on the presence of '3', reusing logic for cleaner code.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define line locations as a function of '3' presence
  def line_locations(is_three_present):
    return {(1, 4), (8, 4), (1, 5), (8, 5)} if is_three_present else {(0, 3), (8, 3), (0, 8), (8, 8)}
  # Draw the T-shape and lines
  return fill(
    fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 3, connect((4,3),(4,5)) | connect((3,4),(5,4))),
    1,
    line_locations(3 in {v for r in I for v in r})
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Location Function:** Defines a function `line_locations` that returns the appropriate line coordinates based on the presence of '3'.
2. **Combined Drawing:** Uses nested `fill` calls to create the T-shape and draw the vertical lines in a single expression, making the code more compact.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Create a base canvas with the T-shape
  base_canvas = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 3, connect((4,3),(4,5)) | connect((3,4),(5,4)))
  # Define a function to draw lines based on condition
  draw_conditional_lines = lambda grid, condition, true_locs, false_locs: fill(grid, 1, true_locs) if condition else fill(grid, 1, false_locs)
  # Draw the lines based on '3' presence
  return draw_conditional_lines(
    base_canvas,
    3 in {v for r in I for v in r},
    {(1, 4), (8, 4), (1, 5), (8, 5)},
    {(0, 3), (8, 3), (0, 8), (8, 8)}
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Canvas:** Creates the base canvas with the T-shape.
2. **Lambda Function:** Defines a lambda function `draw_conditional_lines` to encapsulate the conditional line drawing logic.
3. **Functional Application:** Applies the `draw_conditional_lines` function to the base canvas, passing the condition and line locations, for a more functional approach.
