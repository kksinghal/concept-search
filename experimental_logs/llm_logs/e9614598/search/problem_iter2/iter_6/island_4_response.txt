## Transformation Analysis:

The task involves drawing a T-shape on a 10x10 canvas and conditionally adding two vertical lines based on the presence of the color '3' in the input grid.

**Input_0 & Output_0:**

1. **T-Shape:** A T-shape formed by the digit '3' is drawn at the center of the canvas.
2. **Vertical Lines (Conditional):** Since the input grid contains the color '3', two vertical lines formed by the digit '1' are drawn at columns 1 and 8, spanning rows 4 and 5.

**Input_1 & Output_1:**

1. **T-Shape:**  A T-shape formed by the digit '3' is drawn at the center of the canvas.
2. **Vertical Lines (Conditional):** Since the input grid does not contain the color '3', two vertical lines formed by the digit '1' are drawn at columns 0 and 8, spanning rows 3 and 8.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Draw the T-shape
  output = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 3, connect((4,3),(4,5)) | connect((3,4),(5,4)))
  
  # Conditionally draw vertical lines based on color 3 in the input
  return fill(output, 1, {(1, 4), (8, 4), (1, 5), (8, 5)}) if colorcount(I, 3) > 0 else fill(output, 1, {(0, 3), (8, 3), (0, 8), (8, 8)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **T-Shape:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0' and draws the '3'-colored T-shape using `fill` and `connect`.
2. **Conditional Lines:** Uses `colorcount` to check for the presence of color '3' in the input grid. Based on the result, it fills the appropriate locations with '1' to draw the vertical lines.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define a function to draw vertical lines
  draw_vlines = lambda cols, rows: {(i, j) for i in cols for j in rows}
  
  # Draw the T-shape
  output = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 3, connect((4,3),(4,5)) | connect((3,4),(5,4)))
  
  # Conditionally draw the vertical lines using the helper function
  return fill(output, 1, draw_vlines((1, 8), (4, 5)) if 3 in palette(asobject(I)) else draw_vlines((0, 8), (3, 8))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** Defines `draw_vlines` to generate indices for vertical lines given column and row ranges.
2. **T-Shape:**  Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0' and draws the '3'-colored T-shape using `fill` and `connect`.
3. **Conditional Lines:** Uses `palette(asobject(I))` to check for '3' and calls `draw_vlines` with appropriate arguments to fill vertical line indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define a function to draw a single vertical line
  draw_vline = lambda g, col, r_start, r_end: fill(g, 1, {(col, j) for j in range(r_start, r_end + 1)})
  
  # Create the canvas and draw the T-shape
  output = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 3, connect((4,3),(4,5)) | connect((3,4),(5,4)))
  
  # Conditionally draw vertical lines using the helper function
  return branch(
      3 in palette(asobject(I)),
      lambda g: draw_vline(draw_vline(g, 1, 4, 5), 8, 4, 5),
      lambda g: draw_vline(draw_vline(g, 0, 3, 8), 8, 3, 8)
  )(output)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** Defines `draw_vline` to draw a single vertical line on the grid.
2. **T-Shape:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0' and draws the '3'-colored T-shape using `fill` and `connect`.
3. **Conditional Lines:** Uses `branch` to conditionally apply `draw_vline` based on the presence of '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Lambda functions to draw vertical lines based on condition
  draw_lines_true = lambda g: fill(g, 1, {(1, 4), (8, 4), (1, 5), (8, 5)})
  draw_lines_false = lambda g: fill(g, 1, {(0, 3), (8, 3), (0, 8), (8, 8)})
  
  # Draw the T-shape
  output = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 3, connect((4,3),(4,5)) | connect((3,4),(5,4)))
  
  # Conditionally apply lambda functions based on color 3
  return branch(colorcount(I, 3) > 0, draw_lines_true, draw_lines_false)(output)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Lambda Functions:** Defines two lambda functions, `draw_lines_true` and `draw_lines_false`, to draw lines based on the condition.
2. **T-Shape:**  Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0' and draws the '3'-colored T-shape using `fill` and `connect`.
3. **Conditional Application:** Uses `branch` to choose and apply the correct lambda function based on the presence of '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Column indices for vertical lines based on condition
  col_indices = (1, 8) if 3 in palette(asobject(I)) else (0, 8)
  row_indices = (4, 5) if 3 in palette(asobject(I)) else (3, 8)

  # Draw the T-shape
  output = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 3, connect((4,3),(4,5)) | connect((3,4),(5,4)))
  
  # Draw vertical lines using determined indices
  return fill(output, 1, {(i, j) for i in col_indices for j in row_indices})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Conditional Indices:** Determines column and row indices for vertical lines based on the presence of '3'.
2. **T-Shape:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0' and draws the '3'-colored T-shape using `fill` and `connect`.
3. **Line Drawing:** Uses the determined indices to draw vertical lines with '1'.


These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing different DSL function combinations and logic flow.
