['Draw a 3x3 green square whose center overlaps the center of the horizontal line formed by the blue squares.', 'Center a green 3x3 square on the middle of the line connecting the blue squares.', 'Create a green 3x3 square centered on the middle point of the line segment formed by the blue squares.', 'If there are two blue squares, draw a green 3x3 square in the middle of them.

']["For each blue square, draw a vertical line of '3's extending downwards three squares from the center of the blue square.", "From the center of each blue square, extend a line of '3's three squares downwards.", "Draw a vertical line three squares long directly below each blue square, using the '3' character.", "For every blue square, place a '3' directly below it, and two more '3's below the first one, creating a vertical line.", "Extend a downward line of '3's three squares from the center point of every blue square. "]['Count the number of blue pixels in the input grid. In the output grid, color that many pixels green. The green pixels should be arranged in the same pattern as the blue pixels, but shifted one position to the right.', 'Identify the blue pixels in the input grid. In the output grid, color the corresponding pixels green, but shift the entire pattern one position to the right.', 'Replicate the pattern of blue pixels from the input grid onto the output grid using green pixels, but displace the pattern one unit to the right.', 'Copy the arrangement of blue pixels from the input grid and paste it onto the output grid using green pixels, offsetting the pattern horizontally by one unit to the right.', 'Transfer the pattern formed by blue pixels in the input grid to the output grid using green pixels, applying a horizontal shift of one unit to the right.
