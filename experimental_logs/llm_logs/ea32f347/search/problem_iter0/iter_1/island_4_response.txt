## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors objects in the input grid based on their size, but with a specific color mapping. The largest object is always colored '1', the second largest '2', and so on.  Objects of the same size are assigned the same color.

**Example:**

In Input_0, the largest object is the vertical line of '5's.  This object becomes '1' in Output_0. The two smaller objects (single '5' and horizontal line of '5's) are colored '4' and '2' respectively.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rank_object(obj, objs):
    return (-size(obj), obj)
  
  def apply_rank(ranked_obj, i):
    return recolor(i + 1, ranked_obj[1])
  
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  ranked_objs = order(objs, rbind(rank_object, objs))
  O = paint(I, mapply(apply_rank, zip(ranked_objs, interval(0, len(ranked_objs), 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Rank by Size:** `rank_object` is used within `order` to rank objects by size in descending order (largest first).
3. **Apply Color Mapping:** `apply_rank` assigns colors to objects based on their rank. The largest object gets '1', the next largest '2', and so on.
4. **Paint Objects:** `paint` applies the new colors to the objects in the input grid, producing the output grid (`O`).


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_by_size(obj, objs):
    return sorted(objs, key=size, reverse=True).index(obj) + 1
    
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(recolor_by_size(obj, objs), obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects.
2. **Rank and Recolor:** `recolor_by_size` determines the rank of each object based on size (largest to smallest) and returns the corresponding color using `sorted.index`.
3. **Paint Loop:**  The code iterates through each object and uses `paint` to recolor it based on the output of `recolor_by_size`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  sizes = apply(size, objs)
  sorted_sizes = sorted(sizes, reverse=True)
  mapping = dict(zip(sorted_sizes, interval(1, len(sizes) + 1, 1)))
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(mapping[size(obj)], obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Sizes:**  The code identifies objects and calculates their sizes.
2. **Size-Color Mapping:** A dictionary (`mapping`) is created to map object sizes to their corresponding colors (largest size -> '1', and so on).
3. **Recolor and Paint:** The code iterates through each object, retrieves its color from the `mapping` dictionary, and then uses `paint` to apply the color.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_color(obj, sorted_objs):
    for i, (s, o) in enumerate(sorted_objs):
      if o == obj:
        return i + 1

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  sorted_objs = sorted(objs, key=size, reverse=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    new_color = get_color(obj, sorted_objs)
    O = paint(O, recolor(new_color, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification and Sorting:** The code identifies objects and sorts them by size in descending order.
2. **Find Color:** `get_color` iterates through the sorted object list, and when it finds the current object, it returns its index + 1 as the color.
3. **Recolor and Paint:**  The code loops through each object, gets its color using `get_color`, and then uses `paint` to apply the color.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def size_rank(obj, objs):
    return sorted(set(apply(size, objs)), reverse=True).index(size(obj)) + 1
  
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = paint(I, mapply(lambda obj: recolor(size_rank(obj, objs), obj), objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Objects and Ranking:**  The code identifies objects and defines a `size_rank` function to determine the rank of an object's size. 
2. **Lambda for Recoloring:** A lambda function is used within `mapply` to apply `size_rank` to each object and recolor it accordingly.
3. **Paint Output:** `paint` is used to apply the recoloring to the input grid, generating the final output.
