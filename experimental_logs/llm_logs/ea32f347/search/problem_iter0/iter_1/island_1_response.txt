## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation relabels the objects in the input grid based on their size. The smallest object is labeled '1', the second smallest is '2', and so on. The largest object is always assigned the label '4'.

**Input_0:**
- The smallest object (single '5' cells) becomes '1'.
- The larger object (connected '5' cells) becomes '4'.
- The remaining '0's represent the background and stay unchanged.

**Input_1:**
- Same logic as Input_0, with different object positions.

**Input_2:**
- Same logic as Input_0, with three objects of different sizes.

**Input_3:**
- Same logic as Input_0, with a vertically oriented large object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)  
  objs_sorted = order(objs, size) 
  obj1 = first(objs_sorted)
  obj2 = objs_sorted[1] if len(objs_sorted) > 1 else obj1
  obj3 = objs_sorted[2] if len(objs_sorted) > 2 else obj2
  obj4 = last(objs_sorted)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1, obj1))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, obj2))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, obj3))
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj4)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:**  Extract objects from the input grid (`objects`) ignoring the background and sort them by their size (`order`, `size`).
2. **Handle Different Object Counts:** Assign objects to labels '1' through '4'. If there are fewer than four objects, duplicate assignments are used to maintain consistency.
3. **Paint Objects:** Create a blank canvas (`canvas`) and paint the objects onto it using their assigned labels (`paint`, `recolor`).

### Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  objs_sizes = apply(size, objs)
  sorted_sizes = order(objs_sizes, identity)
  mapping = {obj: sorted_sizes.index(size(obj)) + 1 for obj in objs}
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(mapping[obj], obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Sizes:** Extract objects (`objects`) and their sizes (`size`).
2. **Sort Sizes and Create Mapping:** Sort the sizes (`order`, `identity`) and create a dictionary mapping each object to its corresponding rank in the sorted list.
3. **Paint Objects with Mapping:** Create a blank canvas (`canvas`) and iterate through the objects. For each object, use the mapping to determine its label and paint it onto the canvas (`paint`, `recolor`).

### Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
    size_dict = {size(obj): obj for obj in objs}
    sorted_sizes = order(size_dict, identity)
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for i, s in enumerate(sorted_sizes):
        O = paint(O, recolor(i + 1 if i < 3 else 4, size_dict[s]))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Sizes:** Extract objects (`objects`) and create a dictionary mapping object sizes to their respective objects.
2. **Sort Sizes:** Sort the sizes from the dictionary (`order`, `identity`).
3. **Paint Objects with Sorted Sizes:** Create a blank canvas (`canvas`) and iterate through the sorted sizes. Retrieve the corresponding object from the dictionary and paint it with its rank-based label (1-3 or 4 for the largest).

### Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  obj_list = list(objs)
  obj_list.sort(key=len)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(obj_list):
    O = paint(O, recolor(i+1 if i < 3 else 4, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:** Extract objects (`objects`) into a list and sort the list based on object size using `len` as the key.
2. **Paint Objects with Rank:** Create a blank canvas (`canvas`) and iterate through the sorted object list. Paint each object with a label based on its index in the list (1-3 or 4 if it's the largest).

### Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
    small_obj = argmin(objs, size)
    large_obj = argmax(objs, size)
    mid_objs = objs - {small_obj, large_obj}
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    if small_obj in objs:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, small_obj))
    if mid_objs:
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, first(mid_objs)))
    if len(mid_objs) > 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(4, last(mid_objs)))
    if large_obj in objs:
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, large_obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Identify Objects:** Extract objects (`objects`), then find the smallest (`argmin`, `size`) and largest (`argmax`, `size`) objects directly.
2. **Handle Middle Objects:**  Create a set of middle objects by removing the smallest and largest.
3. **Conditional Painting:** Paint the canvas based on the existence and number of small, middle, and large objects. This approach avoids potential errors from accessing list indices that might not exist.
