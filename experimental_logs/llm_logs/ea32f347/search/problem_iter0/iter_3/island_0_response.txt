## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring the objects in the input grid based on their size and then rearranging them in ascending order of their size from top to bottom. Here's a breakdown:

**Color Mapping:**

* The smallest object retains its original color.
* The second smallest object is recolored to 2.
* The third smallest object is recolored to 4.
* The largest object is recolored to 1.

**Rearrangement:**

* Objects are rearranged vertically within the grid based on their size. 
* The smallest object is placed at the top, followed by the second smallest, and so on, with the largest object at the bottom.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  mapping = {size(objs[0]): mostcolor(objs[0]), 
              size(objs[1]): 2, 
              size(objs[2]): 4, 
              size(objs[3]): 1}
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in sorted(objs, key=size):
    O = paint(O, recolor(mapping[size(obj)], obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`, treating diagonally connected cells as separate objects and excluding the background.
2. **`mapping = {size(objs[0]): mostcolor(objs[0]), size(objs[1]): 2, size(objs[2]): 4, size(objs[3]): 1}`:** Creates a dictionary `mapping` to store the color mapping based on object size.
3. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
4. **`for obj in sorted(objs, key=size):`:** Iterates through the extracted objects `objs` in ascending order of their size.
5. **`O = paint(O, recolor(mapping[size(obj)], obj))`:**  For each object `obj`, it recolors it based on the `mapping` and paints it onto the canvas `O`.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, F, F, T), key=size)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, objs[0])
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, objs[1]))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, objs[2]))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, objs[3]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = sorted(objects(I, F, F, T), key=size)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I` and sorts them in ascending order of their size.
2. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
3. **`O = paint(O, objs[0])`:** Paints the smallest object (at index 0) onto the canvas `O` without recoloring.
4. **`O = paint(O, recolor(2, objs[1]))`:** Recolors the second smallest object to 2 and paints it onto the canvas.
5. **`O = paint(O, recolor(4, objs[2]))`:** Recolors the third smallest object to 4 and paints it onto the canvas.
6. **`O = paint(O, recolor(1, objs[3]))`:** Recolors the largest object to 1 and paints it onto the canvas.
7. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  sizes = sorted(set(size(obj) for obj in objs))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    O = paint(O, recolor({sizes[0]: mostcolor(obj), sizes[1]: 2, sizes[2]: 4, sizes[3]: 1}[size(obj)], obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`sizes = sorted(set(size(obj) for obj in objs))`:** Gets the unique sizes of the objects and sorts them in ascending order.
3. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates an empty canvas `O`.
4. **`for i, obj in enumerate(objs):`:** Iterates through each object `obj` along with its index `i`.
5. **`O = paint(O, recolor({sizes[0]: mostcolor(obj), sizes[1]: 2, sizes[2]: 4, sizes[3]: 1}[size(obj)], obj))`:** Recolors the object based on its size using a dictionary lookup and paints it onto the canvas.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  size_obj = sorted(((size(obj), obj) for obj in objs))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, (s, obj) in enumerate(size_obj):
    O = paint(O, recolor({size_obj[0][0]: mostcolor(obj), size_obj[1][0]: 2, size_obj[2][0]: 4, size_obj[3][0]: 1}[s], obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`size_obj = sorted(((size(obj), obj) for obj in objs))`:** Creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains the size of an object and the object itself. This list is then sorted based on the object sizes.
3. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates an empty canvas `O`.
4. **`for i, (s, obj) in enumerate(size_obj):`:** Iterates through each tuple in `size_obj` with its index `i`. `s` represents the size of the object and `obj` represents the object itself.
5. **`O = paint(O, recolor({size_obj[0][0]: mostcolor(obj), size_obj[1][0]: 2, size_obj[2][0]: 4, size_obj[3][0]: 1}[s], obj))`:** Recolors the object based on its size using a dictionary lookup, where the keys are the sizes from `size_obj` and the values are the corresponding colors.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, F, F, T), key=lambda x: len(x))
  colors = [mostcolor(objs[0]), 2, 4, 1]
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    O = paint(O, recolor(colors[i], obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = sorted(objects(I, F, F, T), key=lambda x: len(x))`:** Extracts objects and sorts them by size using a lambda function.
2. **`colors = [mostcolor(objs[0]), 2, 4, 1]`:**  Defines the color mapping based on object size ranking.
3. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates an empty canvas.
4. **`for i, obj in enumerate(objs):`:** Iterates through each object and its index.
5. **`O = paint(O, recolor(colors[i], obj))`:** Recolors the object using the pre-defined `colors` list based on its index and paints it onto the canvas.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.
