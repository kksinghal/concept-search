## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors objects in the input grid based on their size and paints them onto a blank canvas of the same dimensions. The largest object gets color '1', the second largest gets '2', and so on. Objects with the same size are assigned the same color. 

**Example:**

In Input_0, the longest vertical line of '5's is the largest object and is recolored to '1' in Output_0. The four '5's form the second largest object and are recolored to '4', and the two '5's in the rightmost column form the third largest object and are recolored to '2'. 

This logic applies to all input-output pairs.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects from the input grid
  objs_sized = order(totuple(objs), lambda obj: -size(obj)) # Order objects by size (descending)

  def recolor_obj(i, obj):
    return recolor(i + 1, obj)  # Recolor objects based on their size rank

  objs_recolored = papply(recolor_obj, interval(0, size(objs_sized), 1), objs_sized)  # Apply recolor_obj to each object 
  
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in objs_recolored:
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint each recolored object onto the canvas

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Order Objects:**  We extract objects from the input grid `I` and order them based on their size in descending order.
2. **Recolor Objects:** The `recolor_obj` function assigns a new color (1 for the largest, 2 for the second largest, etc.) to each object based on its position in the sorted list.
3. **Paint to Canvas:** A blank canvas `O` is created, and we iterate through the recolored objects, painting each onto the canvas.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
  objs_sized = order(totuple(objs), lambda obj: -size(obj)) # Order by size

  def paint_ranked(obj, rank):
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(rank, obj))

  O = merge(papply(paint_ranked, objs_sized, interval(1, size(objs_sized) + 1, 1))) # Paint each object with its size rank
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Order:** Similar to Version 1, we extract and order objects by size.
2. **Paint with Rank:** The `paint_ranked` function paints an object onto a blank canvas with its size rank as the color.
3. **Merge and Return:**  We use `papply` to apply `paint_ranked` to each object and its corresponding rank, then merge the results into a single output grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj, all_objs):
    size_index = order(totuple(all_objs), lambda x: -size(x)).index(obj)  # Find object's size rank
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(size_index + 1, obj)) # Paint with rank

  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create a canvas
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, process_object(obj, objs)) # Paint each object with its size rank onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Extract objects from the input grid.
2. **Process Each Object:** For each object, `process_object` determines its size rank, recolors it based on this rank, and then paints it onto a blank canvas.
3. **Paint and Return:** The main function creates a blank canvas `O` and iteratively paints each processed object onto it. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def rank_and_paint(obj, all_objs):
        rank = order(totuple(all_objs), lambda x: -size(x)).index(obj) + 1  # Get size rank
        return recolor(rank, obj) # Recolor with rank

    objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects
    objs_recolored = apply(lambda obj: rank_and_paint(obj, objs), objs) # Recolor each object based on size rank
    O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create a canvas
    for obj in objs_recolored:
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint recolored objects onto the canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract objects from the input grid.
2. **Rank and Recolor:** `rank_and_paint` determines an object's size rank and then recolors it with this rank. 
3. **Paint to Canvas:** Create a blank canvas and paint the recolored objects onto it.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
    objs_sorted = order(totuple(objs), lambda obj: -size(obj)) # Sort objects by size (descending)
    
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs_sorted):
      O = paint(O, recolor(i + 1, obj)) # Paint objects onto canvas with their size rank as color
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort:** Similar to previous versions, we extract objects and sort them by size.
2. **Paint with Rank:** We iterate through the sorted objects, using the loop index `i` (plus 1) as the color to represent the object's size rank. We then paint each object onto the canvas.
