## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring the objects in the input grid based on their color value while preserving their shape and position. 

* **Color Mapping:**
    * Objects with color `5` are recolored to `1`.
    * Objects with color `2` are recolored to `4`.

**Example:**

Input Grid:
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 0
0 5 5 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 0 
```

Output Grid:
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 4 0 
```

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by `Program_B`'s color mapping and `Program_A`'s object manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) 
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = branch(color(obj)==5, paint(O, recolor(1, obj)),
              branch(color(obj)==2, paint(O, recolor(4, obj)), O))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty grid `O` with the same dimensions as input `I`, filled with `0`.
3. **Iterate and Recolor:** The code iterates through each object `obj` in the identified objects:
   *  If the object's color is `5` (`color(obj)==5`), it's recolored to `1` using `recolor(1, obj)` and painted onto the canvas `O`. 
   * If the object's color is `2`, it's recolored to `4` and painted onto the canvas.
   * Otherwise, the canvas remains unchanged.
4. **Return Output:** The final canvas `O` with recolored objects is returned.

**Program Version 2:** (Direct color mapping using a dictionary)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mapping = {5: 1, 2: 4}
  O = tuple(tuple(mapping.get(v, v) for v in r) for r in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly utilizes a dictionary for color mapping, making it concise:

1. **Color Mapping Dictionary:** A dictionary `mapping` maps the original colors (5 and 2) to their corresponding new colors (1 and 4).
2. **Nested Iteration and Recoloring:**  The code iterates through each row `r` and each value `v` within the input grid `I`. It uses `mapping.get(v, v)` to get the new color from the dictionary. If the color is not found in the dictionary (like 0), it defaults to the original color `v`. 
3. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 3:** (Utilizing `replace` function for color substitution)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 5, 1)
  O = replace(O, 2, 4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace Color 5:** The `replace(I, 5, 1)` function replaces all occurrences of color `5` in the input grid `I` with color `1`, storing the result in `O`.
2. **Replace Color 2:**  Similarly, `replace(O, 2, 4)` replaces all occurrences of color `2` in the intermediate grid `O` with color `4`, again storing the result in `O`.
3. **Return Output:** The final grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 4:** (Leveraging `apply` for functional color transformation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_function(v):
    return branch(v==5, 1, branch(v==2, 4, v))
  O = apply(lambda r: apply(recolor_function, r), I)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a functional approach with nested `apply` functions:

1. **Recolor Function:** A helper function `recolor_function(v)` applies the color mapping logic. If the input value `v` is 5, it returns 1; if it's 2, it returns 4; otherwise, it returns the original value `v`.
2. **Apply to Each Cell:** `apply(recolor_function, r)` applies the `recolor_function` to each element (cell) within a row `r`. 
3. **Apply to Each Row:** The outer `apply` function applies the logic from step 2 to each row of the input grid `I`, resulting in the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:** (Combining `switch` and `replace` for efficient color swapping)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = switch(I, 5, 1)
  O = replace(O, 2, 4) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Switch Colors:** The `switch(I, 5, 1)` function efficiently swaps all occurrences of color `5` with color `1` in the input grid `I`, storing the result in `O`. 
2. **Replace Remaining Color:**  Since the color `2` might have been swapped to `1` in the previous step, `replace(O, 2, 4)` is used to ensure all occurrences of the original color `2` are replaced with `4`.
3. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the desired color transformation using the DSL, illustrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
