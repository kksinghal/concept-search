## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation relabels objects in the input grid based on their size. The largest object is labeled 1, the second-largest is labeled 4, the third-largest is labeled 2, and all remaining objects are labeled with incrementing numbers starting from 5.

**Example:**

Input_0:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0
0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0
0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Output_0:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 4 0 0 2 0 0
0 1 0 0 4 0 0 2 0 0
0 1 0 0 4 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

In Input_0, there are three distinct objects:

1. A large object formed by the digit '5' with size 7.
2. Two smaller objects formed by the digit '5' each with size 1.

Following the transformation logic, the largest object (size 7) is labeled '1', the second largest (size 1) is labeled '4', and the remaining object (also size 1) is labeled '2'.

## Program to be Generated:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  def size_rank(obj):
    return size(obj)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, size_rank)
  relabeled_objs = ((1, sorted_objs[-1]), (4, sorted_objs[-2]))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda x: recolor(x[0], x[1]), relabeled_objs)))
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted_objs[:-2]):
    O = paint(O, recolor(i + 5, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Sort by Size:**  `sorted_objs = order(objs, size_rank)` sorts the objects based on their size in descending order using the `size_rank` function.
3. **Relabel Objects:** 
    - `relabeled_objs` is initialized with a tuple containing tuples of (new_label, object) for the two largest objects.
    - The remaining objects are iterated and relabeled with incrementing numbers starting from 5.
4. **Paint Grid:**
    - A canvas of the same size as the input grid is created, filled with '0'.
    -  `paint` function is used to paint the relabeled objects onto the canvas.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  def size_rank(obj):
    return -size(obj)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, size_rank)
  relabeling_map = {sorted_objs[0]: 1, sorted_objs[1]: 4, sorted_objs[2]: 2}
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted_objs[3:]):
    relabeling_map[obj] = i + 5
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(relabeling_map[obj], obj), objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Sort by Size:** Similar to version 1.
3. **Create Relabeling Map:**  A dictionary `relabeling_map` maps the original objects to their new labels based on the transformation logic.
4. **Paint Grid:**
    - A canvas is created similar to version 1.
    - `paint` is used to paint the relabeled objects onto the canvas based on the `relabeling_map`.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  objs_size = apply(size, objs)
  sorted_objs = order(zip(objs_size, objs), lambda x: -x[0])
  O = I
  for i, (s, obj) in enumerate(sorted_objs):
    new_label = {0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 2}.get(i, i + 5) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(new_label, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Sizes:** `objs` and `objs_size` store the objects and their corresponding sizes.
2. **Sort by Size:** `sorted_objs` is created by zipping `objs_size` and `objs` and then sorting them based on sizes in descending order.
3. **Iterate and Relabel:**  
    - The code iterates through the `sorted_objs` and assigns new labels using a dictionary for the first three objects and incrementing numbers from 5 for the rest.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  def relabel_func(obj, objs):
    sorted_objs = order(objs, lambda x: size(x))
    return len(sfilter(sorted_objs, lambda x: size(x) <= size(obj)))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), mapply(lambda obj: {(relabel_func(obj, objs), (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}, objs))
  O = replace(O, 1, 5)
  O = replace(O, 2, 6)
  O = replace(O, 3, 7)
  O = replace(O, 4, 2)
  O = replace(O, 5, 1)
  O = replace(O, 6, 4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Relabel Function (relabel_func):** 
    - This function takes an object and the list of all objects as input.
    - It sorts all objects by size.
    - It then determines the relabeling based on the object's rank in the sorted list.
3. **Apply Relabeling and Paint:** 
    -  `mapply` applies the `relabel_func` to each object and creates a new set of objects with updated labels.
    - `paint` function is used to paint the relabeled objects onto a canvas.
4. **Rearrange Labels:** 
    - A series of `replace` calls are used to rearrange the labels to match the desired output.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  size_dict = {obj: size(obj) for obj in objs}
  sorted_sizes = order(size_dict, lambda x: size_dict[x])
  label_map = {sorted_sizes[-1]: 1, sorted_sizes[-2]: 4, sorted_sizes[-3]: 2}
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted_sizes[:-3]):
    label_map[obj] = i + 5
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(label_map[obj], obj), objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Sizes:** Similar to version 3.
2. **Create Size Dictionary:** `size_dict` stores objects as keys and their sizes as values.
3. **Sort Objects by Size:** `sorted_sizes` contains a list of objects sorted based on their sizes in ascending order.
4. **Create Label Map:**  Similar to version 2, a `label_map` is created based on the sorted objects and the transformation logic.
5. **Paint Grid:**  Similar to version 2, the relabeled objects are painted onto a canvas using the `label_map`.


Each of these program versions implements the same transformation logic but using different approaches and combinations of DSL functions. This demonstrates the flexibility of the DSL and the ability to achieve the same outcome through various code structures.
