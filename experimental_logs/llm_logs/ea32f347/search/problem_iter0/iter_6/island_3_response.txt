## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors objects based on their size ranking, with the smallest object colored 1, the second smallest colored 4, the third smallest colored 2, and any larger objects colored 4.

**Input 0:**

* The smallest object (single 5) is recolored to 1.
* The second smallest objects (two groups of 5s) are recolored to 4.
* The largest object (seven 5s) is recolored to 2.

**Input 1:**

*  Follows the same pattern as Input 0.

**Input 2:**

* Follows the same pattern as Input 0.

**Input 3:**

* Follows the same pattern as Input 0.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  size_objs = order(objs, size)
  return paint(paint(paint(I, recolor(1, size_objs[0])),
                        recolor(4, size_objs[1])),
                        recolor(2, size_objs[2]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Order by Size:** `size_objs = order(objs, size)` orders the objects from smallest to largest based on their size.
3. **Recolor Objects:** The code then recolors the objects:
    - The smallest object (`size_objs[0]`) is recolored to 1.
    - The second smallest object (`size_objs[1]`) is recolored to 4.
    - The third smallest object (`size_objs[2]`) is recolored to 2.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** The function returns the modified grid with the recolored objects.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for i, obj in enumerate(order(objs, size)):
        O = paint(O, recolor({0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 2}.get(i, 4), obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies distinct objects.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:**  Iterates through objects ordered by size (`order(objs, size)`) and uses a dictionary `{0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 2}` to map the object's index to the desired color. If the index is not 0, 1, or 2, it defaults to color 4.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the grid with objects recolored based on size ranking.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(paint(paint(I, 
                      recolor(1, argmin(objs, lambda x: (size(x), -sum(i for v, (i, j) in x))))), 
                        recolor(4, argmin(remove(argmin(objs, lambda x: (size(x), -sum(i for v, (i, j) in x))), objs), size))),
                        recolor(2, argmin(remove(argmin(remove(argmin(objs, lambda x: (size(x), -sum(i for v, (i, j) in x))), objs), size), objs), size)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Find Objects by Size Ranking:** Uses `argmin` with a custom lambda function to find the smallest, second smallest, and third smallest objects based on size and vertical position (using `-sum(i for v, (i, j) in x)` as a tie-breaker for objects with the same size).
3. **Recolor Objects:** Recolors the found objects to 1, 4, and 2 respectively. 
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the grid with the recolored objects.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  smallest = argmin(objs, size)
  remaining = remove(smallest, objs)
  second_smallest = argmin(remaining, size)
  third_smallest = argmin(remove(second_smallest, remaining), size)
  return paint(paint(paint(I, recolor(1, smallest)),
                        recolor(4, second_smallest)),
                        recolor(2, third_smallest))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects.
2. **Find Smallest Objects:** 
   - `smallest = argmin(objs, size)` finds the smallest object.
   - `remaining = remove(smallest, objs)` removes the smallest object from the set.
   - `second_smallest = argmin(remaining, size)` finds the second smallest.
   -  `third_smallest = argmin(remove(second_smallest, remaining), size)` finds the third smallest.
3. **Recolor Objects:** Recolors the smallest, second smallest, and third smallest objects to 1, 4, and 2, respectively.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj_sizes = apply(size, objs)
  sorted_sizes = order(obj_sizes, identity)
  size_rank = {obj_size: i+1 for i, obj_size in enumerate(sorted_sizes)}
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    rank = size_rank[size(obj)]
    color = {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 2}.get(rank, 4) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(color, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Sizes:**  Identifies distinct objects and their sizes.
2. **Sort Sizes:** Sorts object sizes to get a ranking.
3. **Create Size-Rank Map:** Creates a dictionary mapping each size to its rank.
4. **Iterate and Recolor:** Iterates through objects, determines their rank from the dictionary, and uses a second dictionary to map ranks to colors, defaulting to 4 for ranks beyond 3.
5. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the grid with objects recolored according to size ranking.
