## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation relabels the digits in the input grid based on their size (number of connected cells with the same value). The smallest object gets the label '1', the second smallest gets '2', and so on. 

Let's illustrate this with an example:

**Input_2:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

**Output_2:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0
0 0 2 2 2 0 0 4 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

In this example:

- The object with a single '5' is the smallest and is relabeled as '1'.
- The object with three '5's is the second smallest and is relabeled as '2'. 
- The largest object with six '5's is relabeled as '4'.

The background (digit '0') remains unchanged.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for achieving this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T) 
  sizes = apply(size, objs)
  sorted_sizes = order(totuple(sizes), identity)
  mapping = dict(zip(sorted_sizes, range(1, len(sorted_sizes) + 1)))
  relabeled_objs = frozenset({(mapping[size(obj)], (i, j)) for obj in objs for v, (i, j) in obj})
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), relabeled_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies all the objects (connected components) in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Calculate Sizes:** `sizes = apply(size, objs)` calculates the size (number of cells) of each object.
3. **Sort Sizes:** `sorted_sizes = order(totuple(sizes), identity)` sorts the sizes in ascending order.
4. **Create Mapping:** `mapping = dict(zip(sorted_sizes, range(1, len(sorted_sizes) + 1)))` creates a dictionary mapping each unique size to its corresponding rank (smallest size maps to 1, second smallest to 2, etc.).
5. **Relabel Objects:** `relabeled_objs = frozenset({(mapping[size(obj)], (i, j)) for obj in objs for v, (i, j) in obj})` relabels each object based on its size using the mapping.
6. **Paint to Canvas:** `O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), relabeled_objs)` paints the relabeled objects onto a canvas of the same size as the input grid, initially filled with '0's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  def relabel_func(obj):
    global objs
    return len(sfilter(objs, lambda x: size(x) <= size(obj)))
  relabeled_objs = mapply(lambda obj: {(relabel_func(obj), (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}, objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), relabeled_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Relabel Function:** `relabel_func` takes an object as input and determines its label based on its rank in the sorted list of object sizes.  It achieves this by counting the number of objects with sizes less than or equal to the input object's size.
3. **Relabel Objects:** `mapply` applies the `relabel_func` to each object in the `objs` set and reconstructs the object with the new label.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Similar to version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, lambda x: size(x))
  relabeled_objs = frozenset({(i + 1, (a, b)) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted_objs) for v, (a, b) in obj})
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), relabeled_objs)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Sort Objects:** `sorted_objs = order(objs, lambda x: size(x))` sorts the objects directly based on their sizes.
3. **Relabel Objects:** `relabeled_objs = frozenset({(i + 1, (a, b)) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted_objs) for v, (a, b) in obj})` assigns labels to the objects based on their position in the sorted list, starting from 1.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Similar to version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  size_dict = {}
  for obj in objs:
    s = size(obj)
    if s not in size_dict:
      size_dict[s] = len(size_dict) + 1
  relabeled_objs = frozenset({(size_dict[size(obj)], (i, j)) for obj in objs for v, (i, j) in obj})
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), relabeled_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Create Size-Label Dictionary:** It iterates through each object and assigns a unique label to each distinct size encountered.
3. **Relabel Objects:**  It utilizes the size-label dictionary to map object sizes to labels.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Similar to version 1. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  def get_label(obj):
    count = 1
    for other_obj in objs:
      if other_obj != obj and size(other_obj) < size(obj):
        count += 1
    return count
  relabeled_objs = frozenset({(get_label(obj), (i, j)) for obj in objs for v, (i, j) in obj})
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), relabeled_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Get Label Function:** `get_label` iterates through all other objects and increments a counter if their size is smaller than the current object. This effectively determines the rank of the current object's size.
3. **Relabel Objects:** It relabels the objects based on the output of `get_label`.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Similar to version 1.

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each utilizes distinct logic and combinations of DSL functions.
