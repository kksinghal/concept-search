## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying distinct objects within the input grid and applying a consistent color mapping based on their initial color. The mapping is as follows:

* **5 -> 1**
* **2 -> 4** 
* **Other colors -> Retain original color**

**Example:**

In Input_0, there are two distinct objects: one formed by '5's and another by '2's. The '5' object is mapped to '1', and the '2' object is mapped to '4' in the Output_0.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: branch(color(obj)==5, recolor(1, obj), branch(color(obj)==2, recolor(4, obj), obj)), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies connected components in the grid ('I'), treating each digit as a unique color (`univalued=True`).
2. **Recolor Objects:** `mapply` iterates over each object (`obj`) and applies a lambda function for recoloring:
    - If `color(obj) == 5`, recolor the object to '1' using `recolor(1, obj)`.
    - If `color(obj) == 2`, recolor the object to '4' using `recolor(4, obj)`.
    - Otherwise, retain the original color of the object.
3. **Paint to Canvas:** `paint` paints the recoloured objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, effectively achieving the desired transformation. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  mapping = {5: 1, 2: 4}
  O = tuple(tuple(mapping.get(v, v) for v in r) for r in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Color Mapping:** Define a dictionary `mapping` to store the color transformation rules.
2. **Direct Substitution:** Iterate through each cell in the input grid (`I`). For each value (`v`), check if it exists in the `mapping` dictionary. If it does, replace it with the corresponding value from the dictionary; otherwise, keep the original value.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  recolored_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    new_color = 1 if color(obj) == 5 else (4 if color(obj) == 2 else color(obj))
    recolored_objs.add(recolor(new_color, obj))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Grid:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on cell values.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** Iterate through each object (`obj`) in the partitioned set. Determine the `new_color` based on the object's original color using conditional statements. Recolor the object using `recolor(new_color, obj)`.
3. **Paint to Canvas:** Paint the recoloured objects onto a blank canvas to generate the output grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  O = apply(lambda row: tuple(1 if v == 5 else (4 if v == 2 else v) for v in row), I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Apply on Rows:**  Iterate through each row of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Recolor within Rows:** For each value (`v`) in the row, apply the color transformation rules using a conditional expression: `1 if v == 5 else (4 if v == 2 else v)`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  indices_5 = ofcolor(I, 5)
  indices_2 = ofcolor(I, 2)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1, indices_5)), recolor(4, indices_2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Indices:** Identify the indices of cells with values '5' and '2' using `ofcolor(I, 5)` and `ofcolor(I, 2)` respectively.
2. **Paint in Stages:** 
   - Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
   - Paint the cells at `indices_5` with color '1' using `recolor(1, indices_5)`.
   - Paint the cells at `indices_2` with color '4' using `recolor(4, indices_2)`. This two-stage painting ensures that the correct colors are applied at their respective locations.
