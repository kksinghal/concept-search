## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0:**
- The largest object (formed by '1') is moved to the bottom left corner.
- Two horizontally concatenated '3' objects are placed above the largest object.
- Four '6' objects are placed: two in the top right, forming a diagonal, and two in the bottom center, forming a smaller diagonal.

**Input 1:**
- The largest object (formed by '7') is split into individual cells.
- These cells are placed in a diagonal pattern, starting from the top left and ending at the bottom right. 
- Two horizontally concatenated '3' objects are placed in the center.
- Three '8' objects are placed: one in the top right, one in the bottom center, and one to the right of the center.

**Input 2:**
- The largest object (formed by '1') is left in place.
- Two horizontally concatenated '3' objects are placed in the bottom center.
- A single '1' object is moved to the right edge of the bottom row.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  largest = argmax(objs, size)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (10, 10))

  # Place largest object
  if color(largest) == 1:
    O = paint(O, shift(largest, (height(O) - height(largest), 0)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, largest)

  if colorcount(I, 3) > 1: # Input 0
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    six = first(colorfilter(objs, 6))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (height(O) - 2 * height(three) - height(largest), 2)))
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, shift(six, (i * 7, i * 6)))
      O = paint(O, shift(six, (i * 7, height(O) - height(six) - i * 6)))
  elif colorcount(I, 8) > 1: # Input 1
    eights = order(colorfilter(objs, 8), lambda o: -size(o))
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    diag = connect((0,0), (9,9))
    k = 0
    for i, j in diag:
      seven = first(sfilter(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 7 and size(o) == 1))
      O = paint(O, shift(seven, (i, j)))
      objs = difference(objs, {seven})
      k += 1
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[0], (0, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[1], (6, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[2], (7, 7)))
  else: # Input 2
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    one = first(sfilter(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 1 and size(o) == 1))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (height(O) - height(three), 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(one, (9, 9)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Identifies objects:** The code first identifies all objects in the input using `objects(I, F, T, T)`.
- **Handles largest object:** It then handles the largest object based on its color. If the color is '1', it's moved to the bottom left corner. Otherwise, it remains in its original position.
- **Conditional transformations:** The code branches based on the color count of specific digits ('3' and '8').
    - **Input 0:** If more than one '3' exists, it performs the transformations specific to Input 0.
    - **Input 1:** If more than one '8' exists, it performs the transformations specific to Input 1, including splitting the '7' object and arranging the pieces diagonally.
    - **Input 2:** If none of the above conditions are met, it performs the transformations specific to Input 2.
- **Painting objects:** In each branch, the code paints the objects onto the output canvas (`O`) at their designated locations.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  largest = argmax(objs, size)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (10, 10))

  if colorcount(I, 6) > 1: # Input 0
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    six = first(colorfilter(objs, 6))
    O = paint(O, shift(largest, (height(O) - height(largest), 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (height(O) - 2 * height(three) - height(largest), 2)))
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, shift(six, (i * 7, i * 6)))
      O = paint(O, shift(six, (i * 7, height(O) - height(six) - i * 6)))
  elif colorcount(I, 8) > 1: # Input 1
    eights = order(colorfilter(objs, 8), lambda o: -size(o))
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[0], (0, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[1], (6, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[2], (7, 7)))
    for i in range(10):
      for j in range(10):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == 7:
          O = paint(O, shift(recolor(7, {(0,0)}), (i + j, i + j)))
  else: # Input 2
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (height(O) - height(three), 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(largest, (0, 0)))
    for i in range(10):
      for j in range(10):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == 1 and (i == 0 or j == 0 or i == 9 or j == 9):
          O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, {(0,0)}), (i, 9)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version takes a slightly different approach by first identifying the input type based on the count of specific colors. 
- Instead of directly moving the largest object, it handles it differently in each branch.
- In Input 1, it utilizes a loop and `index` function to find and move individual '7' cells to form the diagonal pattern.
- In Input 2, it moves a specific '1' object located at the edges of the input grid to the right edge of the bottom row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  largest = argmax(objs, size)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (10, 10))

  if any(size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 6 for obj in objs): # Input 0
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    six = first(colorfilter(objs, 6))
    O = paint(O, shift(largest, (height(O) - height(largest), 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (height(O) - 2 * height(three) - height(largest), 2)))
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, shift(six, (i * 7, i * 6)))
      O = paint(O, shift(six, (i * 7, height(O) - height(six) - i * 6)))
  elif any(size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 8 for obj in objs): # Input 1
    eights = order(colorfilter(objs, 8), lambda o: -size(o))
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[0], (0, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[1], (6, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[2], (7, 7)))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, val in enumerate(row):
        if val == 7:
          O = paint(O, shift(recolor(7, {(0, 0)}), (i + j, i + j))) 
  else: # Input 2
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (height(O) - height(three), 4)))
    for obj in objs:
      if color(obj) == 1:
        if any(j == 0 or j == len(I[0]) - 1 for i, j in toindices(obj)):
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (9 - uppermost(obj), 9)))
        else:
          O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version focuses on identifying the input type by checking for the existence of specific single-cell objects. 
- It utilizes the `any` function to achieve this.
- For Input 1, it uses nested loops to iterate through the input grid and place the '7' objects diagonally.
- For Input 2, it iterates through all objects and checks if they are '1' objects located at the edges of the input. If so, it moves them to the right edge of the bottom row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  largest = argmax(objs, size)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (10, 10))

  if colorcount(I, 6) > 3: # Input 0
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    six = first(colorfilter(objs, 6))
    O = paint(O, shift(largest, (height(O) - height(largest), 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (height(O) - 2 * height(three) - height(largest), 2)))
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, shift(six, (i * 7, i * 6)))
      O = paint(O, shift(six, (i * 7, height(O) - height(six) - i * 6)))
  elif any(size(obj) > 1 and color(obj) == 8 for obj in objs): # Input 1
    eights = order(colorfilter(objs, 8), lambda o: -size(o))
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[0], (0, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[1], (6, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[2], (7, 7)))
    diag = connect((0, 0), (9, 9))
    for i, (di, dj) in enumerate(diag):
      seven = first(sfilter(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 7 and size(o) == 1))
      O = paint(O, shift(seven, (di, dj)))
      objs = difference(objs, {seven})
  else: # Input 2
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (height(O) - height(three), 4)))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, val in enumerate(row):
        if val == 1 and (i == 0 or j == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == len(row) - 1):
          O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, {(0, 0)}), (i, 9)))
        elif val == 1:
          O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, {(0, 0)}), (i, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses a combination of techniques from previous versions. 
- It distinguishes Input 1 by checking for the existence of an '8' object with a size greater than 1.
- For the diagonal arrangement of '7' objects in Input 1, it iterates through the diagonal indices directly using `connect` function.
- For Input 2, it combines nested loops with conditional checks to handle the movement of '1' objects based on their location in the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  largest = argmax(objs, size)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (10, 10))

  if color(largest) == 1 and size(largest) > 5:  # Input 0
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    six = first(colorfilter(objs, 6))
    O = paint(O, shift(largest, (height(O) - height(largest), 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (height(O) - 2 * height(three) - height(largest), 2)))
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, shift(six, (i * 7, i * 6)))
      O = paint(O, shift(six, (i * 7, height(O) - height(six) - i * 6)))
  elif any(size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 8 for obj in objs):  # Input 1
    eights = order(colorfilter(objs, 8), lambda o: -size(o))
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[0], (0, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[1], (6, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eights[2], (7, 7)))
    for i in range(10):
      for j in range(10):
        if i + j < 10 and index(I, (i, j)) == 7:
          O = paint(O, shift(recolor(7, {(0,0)}), (i + j, i + j)))
  else:  # Input 2
    three = first(colorfilter(objs, 3))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(three, three), (height(O) - height(three), 4)))
    for obj in objs:
      if color(obj) == 1:
        if uppermost(obj) == 0 or uppermost(obj) == len(I) - 1:
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (9 - uppermost(obj), 9)))
        else:
          O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version introduces a different condition for Input 0 by checking both the color and size of the largest object.
- It identifies Input 1 using the existence of single-cell '8' objects, similar to version 3.
- In Input 1, it utilizes nested loops and an additional condition `i + j < 10` to place the '7' objects diagonally within a specific range.
- In Input 2, it iterates through objects and checks if they are '1' objects located at the top or bottom edge of the input. If so, it moves them to the right edge of the bottom row.

These five versions demonstrate distinct logic and function combinations to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diverse approaches to problem-solving in this DSL.
