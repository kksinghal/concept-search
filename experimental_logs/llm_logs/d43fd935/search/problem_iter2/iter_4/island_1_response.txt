## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled horizontally by a factor of 2.
2. **Selective Shifting:** Specific digit values are shifted within the upscaled grid:
    - Digits '3' are shifted diagonally down-right by one cell.
    - Digits '6' are shifted right by two cells.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled horizontally by a factor of 2.
2. **Selective Shifting & Duplication:** 
    - Digits '3' are duplicated and shifted: one copy down-right by one cell, the other two cells down.
    - Digits '8' are shifted down by one cell.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled horizontally by a factor of 2. 
2. **Selective Shifting:**
    - Digits '3' are shifted down by two cells.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = hupscale(I, 2) # Upscale horizontally by 2
  for obj in objects(O, T, F, T):
    v = color(obj)
    if v == 3:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (1, 1))) # Shift '3' diagonally down-right
    elif v == 6:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, 2))) # Shift '6' two cells right
    elif v == 8:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (1, 0))) # Shift '8' one cell down
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version first upscales the input grid horizontally. 
- It then iterates through each object (connected component of same digits) and applies specific shifts based on the object's color (digit value).

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = hupscale(I, 2) 
  for v, offset in {(3, (1, 1)), (6, (0, 2)), (8, (1, 0))}: # Define shifts
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(O, T, F, T), v): # Filter by color
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, offset)) # Apply shift
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to version 1, but uses a dictionary to store the color-specific shifts, making the code more concise.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    O = vconcat(O, I[i:i+1]) # Duplicate each row
  for obj in objects(O, T, F, T):
    v = color(obj)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, {3: (1, 1), 6: (2, 0), 8: (1, 0)}.get(v, (0, 0)))) # Shift based on color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version performs the upscaling by duplicating each row of the input grid.
- It then applies the color-specific shifts as in previous versions.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (len(I), len(I[0]) * 2)) # Create empty upscaled canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    v = color(obj)
    offset = {3: (1, 1), 6: (2, 0), 8: (1, 0)}.get(v, (0, 0))
    O = underpaint(O, shift(obj, (0, leftmost(obj) * 2 + offset[1]))) # Paint with shift onto canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version first creates an empty canvas with the desired upscaled dimensions.
- It then iterates through the objects in the input grid, applies the shifts, and paints them onto the canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = hupscale(I, 2) # Upscale horizontally
  for v in palette(I): # Iterate through colors
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(O, T, F, T), v):
      if v == 3:
        if uppermost(obj) in {2, 6}:
          O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (2, 0))) # Shift '3' down by two cells in specific rows
        else:
          O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (1, 1))) # Shift '3' diagonally down-right in other rows
      elif v == 6:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, 2))) # Shift '6' two cells right
      elif v == 8:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (1, 0))) # Shift '8' one cell down
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version introduces conditional shifting for digit '3', where the shift direction depends on the row position of the object. 

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for tackling spatial reasoning tasks.
