## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

1. The main diagonal line of '1's is mirrored horizontally and shifted to the right half of the grid.
2. The two '3's are moved together and horizontally duplicated, forming a 2x4 block in the center.
3. A vertical line of '6's is drawn, spanning most of the grid height.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

1. The diagonal line of '7's is preserved but extended horizontally with a '3' at the end.
2. A block of '3's is added above the extended '7' line. 
3. The '8's are mostly preserved but some are horizontally duplicated, creating a small 2x3 block and a horizontal line.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**

1. The diagonal line of '1's is preserved and extended downwards with a '1' at the bottom.
2. A block of '3's (2x2) is added below the diagonal line.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, (10, 10))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if i == 0:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(hmirror(obj), (5, 4)))
    elif i == 1:
      parts = hsplit(subgrid(obj, I), 2)  # Extract subgrid before splitting
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(hupscale(parts[0], 2), (-2, 3))) # Upscale first part
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(hupscale(parts[1], 2), (-1, 3))) # Upscale second part
    else:
      new_obj = recolor(color(obj), {(j, 6) for j in range(6, 10)})
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, new_obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

* This version borrows heavily from Program_A, focusing on the issue of splitting a non-grid object.
* We introduce `subgrid(obj, I)` to extract the smallest grid containing the object before splitting.
* `hupscale(parts[0], 2)` and `hupscale(parts[1], 2)` are used to duplicate the split parts horizontally, achieving the desired block effect.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, (10, 10))
  obj_idx = 0
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != bg:  # Ignore background objects
      if obj_idx == 0: 
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(hmirror(obj), (5, 4)))
      elif obj_idx == 1:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(hupscale(crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (2,1)),2), (-2, 3))) # Directly crop and upscale the relevant part of the input grid
      elif obj_idx == 2:
        new_obj = recolor(color(obj), {(j, 6) for j in range(6, 10)})
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, new_obj)
      obj_idx += 1
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

* This version builds upon Program_B, addressing the object duplication and line drawing issues.
* Instead of splitting, it directly crops the 2x1 section of the second object from the input grid using `crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (2,1))`.
* `hupscale(..., 2)` then doubles this cropped section horizontally, effectively duplicating it.
* For the vertical line, it recolors a set of indices with the desired color.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, (10, 10))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if i == 0: 
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(hmirror(obj), (5, 4)))
    elif i == 1: 
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(hconcat(obj, obj), (-2, 3))) # Use hconcat to duplicate the object horizontally
    else:
      line = recolor(color(obj), connect((0,6), (0,9))) # Use connect to create a line of the desired color
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, line)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses a different approach for object manipulation, leveraging `hconcat` for duplication and `connect` for line drawing.
* `hconcat(obj, obj)` directly concatenates the second object with itself, creating a horizontal duplication.
* `connect((0,6), (0,9))` generates the indices for a vertical line, which are then recolored.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, (10, 10))
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=lambda x: -len(x))): # Sort objects by size (descending)
    if i == 0: 
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(hmirror(obj), (5, 4)))
    elif i == 1:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(hconcat(obj, obj), (-2, 3)))
    else:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(color(obj), {(j, 6) for j in range(6, 10)}))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

* This version focuses on ensuring the correct object processing order.
*  It sorts the objects by size using  `sorted(objs, key=lambda x: -len(x))`, ensuring the largest object (diagonal line) is processed first.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, (10, 10))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(hmirror(obj), (5, 4)))
    elif color(obj) == 3:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(hconcat(obj, obj), (-2, 3)))
    else:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(color(obj), {(j, 6) for j in range(6, 10)}))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly uses the color values to identify and process each object.
* While not as robust as other solutions, it highlights the possibility of using color-based logic for this specific transformation.

Each of these versions offers a different way to achieve the desired output, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. They are also distinct from each other, utilizing various DSL functions and logic, demonstrating multiple solutions to the given problem.
