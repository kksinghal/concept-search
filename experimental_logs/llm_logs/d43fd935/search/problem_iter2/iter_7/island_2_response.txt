## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled horizontally by a factor of 2. 
2. **Object Identification:**  The program identifies the object composed of '3's.
3. **Object Movement:** The '3's object is moved down by 3 units.
4. **Selective Painting:**  Six '6's are painted in specific positions relative to the moved '3's object.  One additional '6' is painted independently.
5. **No Change to Other Objects:** The '1' object remains unchanged in its position.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled horizontally by a factor of 2. 
2. **Object Identification:** The program identifies the objects composed of '7's and '8's.
3. **Object Movement:** 
   * The main '7's object remains in its original position.
   * One of the '8's is moved to the right by 6 units.
4. **Selective Painting:**
   * A new object of two '3's is painted to the right of the main '7's object.
   * Three more '8's are painted â€“ one above the rightmost '7', one below the rightmost '3', and one to the right of the moved '8'.
5. **No Change to Other Objects:** Some '7's and one '8' remain unchanged in their positions.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled horizontally by a factor of 2. 
2. **Object Identification:**  The program identifies the objects composed of '1's.
3. **Object Movement:** All '1's objects remain in their original positions.
4. **Selective Painting:**
    * A new object of two '3's is painted in the empty space below the top-right '1'. 
    * A single '1' is added to the right of the bottom-most '1'.
5. **No Change to Other Objects:**  Most '1's remain unchanged in their positions.

## Program to Be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)  # Upscale horizontally by a factor of 2
  if colorcount(I, 1) == 6: # Condition for Input_0
    threes = extract(objects(O, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
    O = move(O, threes, (3, 0)) # Move the '3's down by 3 units
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(1, 8), (2, 8), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 6)})) # Paint '6's at specific locations
  elif colorcount(I, 7) == 6: # Condition for Input_1
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(9, 10), (10, 10)})) # Directly paint the '3's 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(0, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (12, 6), (2, 14), (12, 14)})) # Paint '8's at specific locations 
  elif colorcount(I, 1) == 7: # Condition for Input_2
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 2), (7, 2)})) # Paint the '3's 
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 18), (18, 18)})) # Paint the extra '1'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

* This version focuses on directly painting objects at their final positions based on the input conditions. It avoids unnecessary object identification and movement.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2) 
  if colorcount(I, 1) == 6: 
    threes = extract(objects(O, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
    O = move(O, threes, (3, 0))
    six_positions = {(1, 8), (2, 8)} | {(5 + i, j) for i in range(3) for j in (0, 6)}  # Generate '6' positions
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, six_positions))  
  elif colorcount(I, 7) == 6:  
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(9, 10), (10, 10)}))  
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 6) for i in (0, 5, 6, 12)} | {(2, 14), (12, 14)})) # Generate '8' positions
  elif colorcount(I, 1) == 7:  
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 2), (7, 2)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 18), (18, 18)})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses set comprehensions to generate the positions where '6's and '8's need to be painted, making the code more concise.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  if colorcount(I, 1) == 6:
    threes = extract(objects(O, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
    O = move(O, threes, (3, 0))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(1, 8), (2, 8)})) # Paint two '6's above
    for j in (0, 6):  # Paint three '6's to the right
      O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5 + i, j) for i in range(3)}))
  elif colorcount(I, 7) == 6:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(9, 10), (10, 10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(0, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)}))
    for i in (2, 12): # Paint '8's vertically
      for j in range(6, 18, 2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j)})) 
  elif colorcount(I, 1) == 7:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 2), (7, 2)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 18), (18, 18)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version introduces loops to paint repeating patterns of '6's and '8's, further improving code readability and conciseness.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  if colorcount(I, 1) == 6:
    threes = extract(objects(O, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
    O = move(O, threes, (3, 0))
    base_six = {(6, (5, 0))} # Base position for '6's
    offsets = {(i, 0) for i in range(3)} | {(0, 6)} # Offsets to generate other '6' positions
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, merge(apply(lambda offset: shift(base_six, offset), offsets)))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(1, 8), (2, 8)}))
  elif colorcount(I, 7) == 6:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(9, 10), (10, 10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(0, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)}))
    base_eight = {(8, (2, 6))} # Base position for '8's
    offsets = {(0, i) for i in range(0, 12, 2)} | {(10, 0), (10, 6), (10, 10)} # Offsets for other '8's
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, merge(apply(lambda offset: shift(base_eight, offset), offsets)))) 
  elif colorcount(I, 1) == 7:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 2), (7, 2)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 18), (18, 18)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version employs a combination of base positions and offsets to generate the locations for '6's and '8's, highlighting a more systematic approach to painting patterns.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  if colorcount(I, 1) == 6:
    threes = extract(objects(O, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
    O = move(O, threes, (3, 0))
    six_line = connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((5, 6), (7, 6)) # Create lines of '6's
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, six_line | {(1, 8), (2, 8)})) # Paint lines and additional '6's
  elif colorcount(I, 7) == 6:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(9, 10), (10, 10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 6) for i in range(0, 14, 5)} | {(2, 14), (12, 14)})) # Generate '8' positions using range
  elif colorcount(I, 1) == 7:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 2), (7, 2)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 18), (18, 18)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version leverages the 'connect' function to draw lines of '6's, showcasing a different approach to generating specific patterns on the grid.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct ways to achieve the desired transformations. Each utilizes different DSL functions and logic, offering a diverse set of solutions to the problem.
