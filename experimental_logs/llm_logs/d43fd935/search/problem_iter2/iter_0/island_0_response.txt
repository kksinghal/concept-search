## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and extending them horizontally to the right, stopping just before encountering a different object or the grid boundary. 

**Example:**

In Input_0, the '1' object at (0,0) doesn't extend as it's at the grid boundary. The '3' object at (4,3) extends to the right, filling the cells (4,4) and (4,5). Similarly, the '6' object at (5,5) extends to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8), stopping before the '1' at (5,9). 

**Program Versions:**

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify all objects in the input grid
  O = I                      # Initialize the output grid
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)           # Get the color of the current object
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)  # Find the rightmost column of the object
    for j in range(rightmost_col + 1, len(I[0])):  # Iterate from the next column to the grid edge
      next_loc = (uppermost(obj), j) 
      if index(I, next_loc) == mostcolor(I):  # Check if the next cell is background
        O = fill(O, c, frozenset({next_loc}))  # Fill the cell with the object color
      else:
        break                     # Stop extending if another object or grid edge is encountered
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through each object, finds its rightmost point, and extends it horizontally until it hits another object or the grid boundary.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Initialize output with background color
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != mostcolor(I):  # If not background
                O = fill(O, val, hfrontier((i, j)))  # Fill the row from current position
                break               # Move to the next row
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through the input grid row-by-row. If it finds a non-background cell, it fills the entire row from that position onwards with the cell's color and then moves to the next row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(j, len(I[0]))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through each cell of each object and fills the row from that cell to the right edge of the grid with the cell's color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(j, len(I[0]))}))
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version is similar to version 2, but instead of using the `hfrontier` function, it explicitly fills the row from the current position to the right edge.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])):
        for i in range(len(I)):
            if I[i][j-1] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j] == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, I[i][j-1], frozenset({(i, j)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through the grid column by column, starting from the second column. For each cell, it checks if the cell to its left is a non-background color and the current cell is a background color. If this condition is true, it fills the current cell with the color of the cell to its left.

These are just a few examples of how you can use the DSL to achieve the desired transformation. The best approach will depend on the specific requirements of your application and your own coding style.
