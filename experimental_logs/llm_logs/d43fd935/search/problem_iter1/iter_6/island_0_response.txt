## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to extend the rightmost occurrence of each foreground object horizontally to the edge of the grid, filling in the background. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The rightmost '1' object extends rightward, filling the background '0's until the edge of the grid.
* Similarly, the rightmost '3' object and the rightmost '6' object extend rightward, filling the background.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The rightmost '7' object, '3' object, and '8' object each extend rightward, replacing any background '0's until they reach the grid's right edge.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The pattern continues: the rightmost occurrences of '1' and '3' extend horizontally to the right, filling the background.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for achieving the described transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  for x in palette(grid) - {mostcommon(grid)}: # Iterate over each foreground color
    obj = argmax(colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, True), x), rightmost) # Find the rightmost object of color x
    grid = fill(grid, x, frozenset((i, j) # Fill with color x
                   for i in range(height(grid)) # For every row
                   for j in range(rightmost(obj), width(grid)) # From the rightmost object's column to the grid edge
                   if index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcommon(grid))) # If the cell is background
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate colors:** Loop through each unique color in the grid, excluding the background color.
2. **Find rightmost object:** Identify the rightmost object of the current color.
3. **Fill rightward:** Fill the grid with the current color from the rightmost object's column to the grid's edge, only replacing background cells.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True): # Iterate over foreground objects
    grid = fill(grid, color(obj), # Fill with object's color
                 {(i, j) for i in range(height(grid)) # For every row
                  for j in range(rightmost(obj), width(grid)) # From the object's rightmost column to the grid edge
                  if index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcommon(grid)}) # If the cell is background
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate objects:** Loop through each foreground object in the grid.
2. **Fill rightward:**  For each object, fill the grid with the object's color from its rightmost column to the grid's edge, overwriting only background cells.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid)), # Create a blank canvas filled with background color
               merge(shift(obj, (0, width(grid) - rightmost(obj) - 1)) # Shift each object to the right edge
                     for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True))) # Iterate over foreground objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create canvas:** Generate a blank grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Shift objects:**  Shift each foreground object horizontally so that its rightmost point touches the right edge of the grid.
3. **Paint objects:**  Paint the shifted objects onto the blank canvas, resulting in the final transformed grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  bg = mostcommon(grid) # Store background color
  return tuple(tuple(bg if j < rightmost(extract(objects(grid, True, False, True), lambda obj: v == color(obj))) else v 
                     for j, v in enumerate(row)) # Fill with background color if left of the rightmost object of the same color
                 for row in grid) # Iterate over each row
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Store background:** Identify and store the background color for later use.
2. **Iterate rows:**  Loop through each row of the grid.
3. **Fill left of rightmost object:** For each cell in the row, check if it's positioned to the left of the rightmost object of the same color. If so, replace it with the background color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  for x in palette(grid) - {mostcommon(grid)}: # Iterate over each foreground color
    target_j = max(j for i, row in enumerate(grid) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == x) # Find the rightmost column containing color x
    grid = tuple(tuple(x if k >= target_j and v == mostcommon(grid) else v # Fill with color x if right of target column and background
                      for k, v in enumerate(row))
                  for row in grid) # Iterate over rows
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate colors:** Loop through each unique color in the grid, excluding the background color.
2. **Find rightmost column:** Determine the rightmost column index where the current color exists.
3. **Fill rightward:** For each cell, if it's located to the right of the identified column and is a background color, replace it with the current color. 

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieving the same grid transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
