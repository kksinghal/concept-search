## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to "extend" objects horizontally towards the right, stopping at the next non-zero element or the grid's edge. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

- The '3' object extends right to fill the space before the '1'.
- The '6' objects extend right to the grid's edge.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

- The '7' objects remain unchanged as there are either other digits or the grid's edge to their right.
- The '3' object extends right to the '8'.
- The '8' objects extend right to the grid's edge. 

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

- The '1' objects extend right until reaching another '1' or the grid's edge.
- The '3' object remains unchanged as it's bound by the grid's edge.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions achieving the described transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] != 0 and O[i][j+1] == 0:
        k = j + 1
        while k < len(I[0]) and O[i][k] == 0:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each row and then each cell in the row (except the last one).
2. Checks if the current cell is non-zero and the cell to its right is zero in the output grid.
3. If true, it extends the current cell's value to the right until it encounters a non-zero cell or the edge of the grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost_j, width(I)):
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj) or index(I, (i,j)) == 0:
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input.
2. Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. For each object, it fills the canvas with the object's color from its leftmost point to the right, either until it hits a non-zero cell in the input grid or reaches the edge of the grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        current_color = 0
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != 0:
                current_color = I[i][j]
            elif current_color != 0:
                O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each row and keeps track of the current non-zero color encountered.
2. If it finds a zero and there is a current non-zero color, it fills that zero with the current color, effectively extending the previous object.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row[:-1]):
      if value != 0 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, value, connect((i, j), (i, len(row)-1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each row and cell (except the last one).
2. If the current cell is non-zero and the cell to its right is zero, it draws a line of the current cell's color from the current position to the end of the row.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    max_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == 0:
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates over each object in the input grid.
2. Determines the leftmost and rightmost column indices of the object.
3. For each cell within the object's bounding box, if the cell is zero, it fills it with the object's color.

These are just a few examples, and many other possible solutions could be derived by combining different functions from the DSL in creative ways.
