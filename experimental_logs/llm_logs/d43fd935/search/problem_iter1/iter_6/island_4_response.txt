## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally to the right until they hit another object with a different color. 

**Input_0:**

* The '1' objects in the top and bottom rows extend rightward.
* The '3' objects extend rightward to the '1' object.
* The '6' objects remain unchanged as they are already touching other colored objects.

**Input_1:**

* The '7' objects extend rightward to the '8' objects.
* The '8' objects extend rightward to the '7' objects (or edge of the grid).
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it is already touching the '8' object.

**Input_2:**

* The '1' objects extend rightward until they encounter another '1' object or the edge of the grid.
* The '3' objects remain unchanged as they are already touching each other.


## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))}))
        break  # Move to the next row after extending an object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the grid, except the last column. If a cell is not the background color and its right neighbor is the background color, it extends the object rightward to the end of the row. The `break` statement ensures that each object in a row is extended only once.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
        rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
        for j in range(rightmost_j + 1, width(I)):
            if index(I, (uppermost(obj), j)) != mostcolor(I):
                break
            O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), k) for k in range(rightmost_j, j)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each non-background object. It identifies the rightmost column of each object. Then it extends the object horizontally to the right, cell by cell, until it encounters a non-background color.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return rot90(rot90(rot90(fbacfcdiedeheadfjjjffhaacedajjei(rot90(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the functionality of `Program_B` which extends objects downwards. It rotates the input grid by 270 degrees, applies `Program_B`, and then rotates the result by 90 degrees to achieve the desired horizontal extension.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    j = 0
    while j < width(I):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and current_color is None:
        current_color = index(O, (i, j))
      elif index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) and current_color is not None:
        O = paint(O, recolor(current_color, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))}))
        break
      j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row, keeping track of the current object color being extended.  When it encounters a background color cell and it's currently extending an object, it fills the rest of the row with that object's color and moves to the next row. 

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)-1):
            if index(I, (i,j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(I,(i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, index(I,(i, j)), product({i}, interval(j, width(I), 1)))
                break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell, except the last column. If a cell is not the background color and its right neighbor is the background color, it identifies the object's color at that cell and fills from that cell to the end of the row with the object's color. The `break` statement ensures that each object in a row is extended only once.


These are five different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version showcases a distinct approach and logic flow, demonstrating diverse solutions within the constraints of the DSL.
