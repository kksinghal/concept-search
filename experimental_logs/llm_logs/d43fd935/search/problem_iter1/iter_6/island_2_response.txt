## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of the least common color in the grid and extending them horizontally to the right until they encounter a different color or the edge of the grid.

**Input 0:**
- The least common color is 1.
- The 1 at (3,8) extends right to become (3,8), (3,9).
- The 1 at (9,4) extends right to become (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9).

**Input 1:**
- The least common color is 7.
- The 7 at (0,1) extends right to include (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5).
- The 7 at (2,3) extends right to include (2,4).
- The 7 at (9,6) extends right to include (9,7), (9,8), (9,9).

**Input 2:**
- The least common color is 1.
- The existing 1 objects are already extended as far as possible.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def jfadfficedceejeebibbdfadbeiieihf(grid):
  target_color = leastcolor(grid)
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == target_color:
        grid = fill(grid, target_color, connect((i,j), (i, width(grid)-1)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Target Color:**  The `leastcolor(grid)` function determines the least common color in the grid.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:**  The code iterates through each cell of the grid.
3. **Extend Horizontally:** If a cell contains the target color, the `fill` function, along with `connect`,  is used to extend a line of that color to the right edge of the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def jfadfficedceejeebibbdfadbeiieihf(grid):
  lc = leastcolor(grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      lc if any(v == lc for v in row[j:]) else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Least Common Color:**  `lc = leastcolor(grid)` stores the least common color for efficiency.
2. **Row-wise Processing:**  The outer `tuple( ... for row in grid)` iterates over each row.
3. **Horizontal Check:** For every cell `(i, j)`, `any(v == lc for v in row[j:])` checks if the target color `lc` exists from the current column `j` to the end of the row.
4. **Conditional Fill:** If the target color is found, the current cell is set to `lc`; otherwise, the original value `v` is retained. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def jfadfficedceejeebibbdfadbeiieihf(grid):
  def process_row(row):
    least_color = leastcolor(grid)
    found = False
    new_row = []
    for val in row:
      if val == least_color:
        found = True
      new_row.append(least_color if found else val)
    return tuple(new_row)
  return tuple(process_row(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`process_row` Function:** This helper function handles the transformation for a single row.
2. **Find Least Color:** It first finds the least common color (`least_color`) in the entire grid.
3. **Iterate and Flag:** It then iterates through the row, setting a flag (`found`) when it encounters the `least_color`.
4. **Conditional Fill:**  From the point where `least_color` is found onwards, all cells are filled with `least_color`; otherwise, the original value is kept.
5. **Apply to All Rows:** The main function applies `process_row` to each row of the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def jfadfficedceejeebibbdfadbeiieihf(grid):
  least_color = leastcolor(grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      least_color if any((i, k) in ofcolor(grid, least_color) for k in range(j, width(grid))) else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Least Color:** The `leastcolor(grid)` function finds the least common color in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Check:**  It iterates through each cell (i, j) of the grid. For every cell, it checks if there is any cell with the least color in the same row from the current column to the end of the row.
3. **Conditional Fill:** If a cell with the least color is found, the current cell is filled with the least color; otherwise, the original value is retained.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def jfadfficedceejeebibbdfadbeiieihf(grid):
    lc = leastcolor(grid)
    def process_cell(row, j, v):
        return lc if any(x == lc for x in row[j:]) else v
    return tuple(
        tuple(process_cell(row, j, v) for j, v in enumerate(row)) 
        for row in grid
    )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`process_cell` Function:** This helper function processes a single cell within a row. 
2. **Check for Least Color:** It checks if the least common color (`lc`) is present in the row from the current cell's index (`j`) onwards.
3. **Conditional Return:** If `lc` is found, the function returns `lc`; otherwise, it returns the original cell value (`v`). 
4. **Nested Iteration:** The code iterates over each row and applies `process_cell` to each cell within that row using nested comprehensions.
