## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples involves extending objects to the right until they hit another object or the edge of the grid. Here's a breakdown for each pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '1' objects are extended rightwards. The top '1' object extends to the rightmost edge, while the bottom '1' object stops when it encounters the '6' object.
* The '3' and '6' objects remain unchanged as they are already touching other objects on their right.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The '7' object in the middle row extends rightwards until it encounters the '3' object.
* The top '8' object extends rightwards to the edge of the grid.
* Other objects remain unchanged.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The '1' objects are extended rightwards.  Each extension stops upon encountering another '1' object.
* The '3' object remains unchanged. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    extension = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in product(range(height(grid)), range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(grid))) 
                          if (i, j) in backdrop(obj) 
                          and all(index(grid, (i, k)) == mostcommon(grid) for k in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, j + 1)))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj | recolor(color(obj), extension))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialize Canvas:** Create a new grid (`new_grid`) filled with the most common color from the input grid, using `canvas` and `mostcommon`.
2.  **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object (`obj`) found in the input grid using `objects`. We use parameters `True, False, True` to identify objects based on connected components of the same color, excluding the background.
3.  **Calculate Extension:** For each object, identify cells (`extension`) that meet the following:
    *   Belong to the object's backdrop (`backdrop(obj)`).
    *   Have a column index (`j`) greater than the object's rightmost column (`rightmost(obj) + 1`).
    *   All cells between the object's right edge and the current cell (same row) are the background color (`all(index(grid, (i, k)) == mostcommon(grid) ...`).
4.  **Extend Object:** Paint the object and its extension (`obj | recolor(color(obj), extension)`) onto the `new_grid` using the object's color.
5.  **Return Grid:** Return the modified `new_grid`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(grid)):
      column = {(i, j) for i in range(height(grid)) if (i, j) in backdrop(obj) and index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcommon(grid)}
      if not column.isdisjoint(toindices(obj)):
        break
      grid = fill(grid, color(obj), column)
  return grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object (`obj`) found in the input grid using `objects`. 
2. **Iterate Columns:** For each object, iterate through columns (`j`) from its rightmost column (`rightmost(obj) + 1`) to the grid's right edge (`width(grid)`).
3. **Check Column:** For each column, identify cells that belong to the object's backdrop (`backdrop(obj)`) and have the background color (`index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcommon(grid)`).
4. **Extend or Break:** If the identified cells in the column intersect with the object's indices (`not column.isdisjoint(toindices(obj))`), it means we've hit another object, so we break the column iteration. Otherwise, we fill the identified cells with the object's color (`fill(grid, color(obj), column)`.
5. **Return Grid:** Return the modified `grid`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, width(grid)):
        if (i, k) in toindices(obj) or index(grid, (i, k)) != mostcommon(grid):
          break
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(color(obj), (i, k))})
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create a new grid (`new_grid`) filled with the background color using `canvas` and `mostcommon`.
2. **Iterate Objects and Cells:** Loop through each object (`obj`) and then each cell (`i, j`) within the object.
3. **Extend Rightwards:** For each cell, iterate through columns (`k`) to the right, checking if the cell is either part of the object or not a background color. If it's a background cell, paint it with the object's color.
4. **Paint Original Object:** After extending, paint the original object onto the `new_grid`.
5. **Return Grid:** Return the modified `new_grid`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    min_row, max_row = uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)
    for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(grid)):
      if any(index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcommon(grid) for i in range(min_row, max_row + 1)):
        break
      grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(min_row, max_row + 1)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object in the grid.
2. **Get Object Boundaries:** Determine the top and bottom row indices of the object.
3. **Iterate Columns:** For each column to the right of the object, check if any cell within the object's row boundaries is not a background color. 
4. **Extend or Break:** If a non-background cell is found, stop extending the object. Otherwise, fill the entire column segment within the object's row boundaries with the object's color.
5. **Return Grid:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), (h, w))
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w):
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj):
          new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(color(obj), (i, k)) for k in range(j, w) if (i, k) in backdrop(obj) and all(index(grid, (i, l)) == mostcommon(grid) for l in range(j, k))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create a new grid (`new_grid`) filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Objects and Cells:** Loop through each object and each cell within the grid.
3. **Extend Rightwards from Cell:** For each cell belonging to an object, paint a horizontal line rightwards from the cell until encountering a non-background cell or the edge of the object's backdrop.
4. **Return Grid:** Return the modified grid.

Each of these program versions provides a different approach to achieving the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning problems.
