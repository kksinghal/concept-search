## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the least common color in the grid (excluding the background color, which is the most common) and extending objects of that color horizontally to the right edge of the grid. 

**Input_0:**

* Least common color (excluding background '0'): '1' 
* Objects with '1' are extended rightward, filling with '1's.

**Input_1:**

* Least common color (excluding background '0'): '7'
* Objects with '7' are extended rightward, filling with '7's.

**Input_2:**

* Least common color (excluding background '0'): '1'
* Objects with '1' are extended rightward, filling with '1's.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  target_color = leastcolor(grid) 
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == target_color:
        grid = fill(grid, target_color, connect((i,j), (i, width(grid)-1)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color:**  `target_color = leastcolor(grid)` determines the least common color in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  It iterates through each cell. If a cell contains the `target_color`, it uses `connect` to draw a horizontal line from that cell's position `(i, j)` to the right edge of the grid `(i, width(grid)-1)`. This line is then filled with the `target_color` using the `fill` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  target_color = leastcolor(grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      target_color if target_color in row[j:] else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color:**  Similar to Version 1, it identifies the `target_color` using `leastcolor(grid)`.
2. **Inline Replacement:** Instead of explicitly drawing lines, this version uses Python's list comprehension to achieve the transformation. It iterates through each row and checks if the `target_color` exists from the current column `j` to the end of the row `row[j:]`. If it does, the cell is replaced with `target_color`; otherwise, the original value `v` is kept.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  target_color = leastcolor(grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(any(equality(v, target_color) for v in row[j:]), target_color, v)
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* **Functional Approach:**  This version emphasizes a functional style using the `branch` function. 
* **Condition for Branching:** For every cell, it checks if the `target_color` is present from the current column to the right using `any(equality(v, target_color) for v in row[j:])`. 
* **Applying the Branch:** Based on the condition's truth value, `branch` either returns the `target_color` (if the condition is true) or the original cell value `v` (if the condition is false).

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  target_color = leastcolor(grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      v if not any(c == target_color for c in row[j:]) else target_color
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* **Inverse Logic:** This version uses an inverted condition compared to the previous versions. 
* **Checking for Absence:** It checks if the `target_color` is *absent* from the current column to the right using `not any(c == target_color for c in row[j:])`.
* **Conditional Assignment:** If the `target_color` is absent, the original value `v` is kept. Otherwise, it's replaced with the `target_color`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  target_color = leastcolor(grid)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(contained(target_color, set(row[j:])), target_color, v) 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* **Set-based Check:** It uses the `contained` function to check the presence of the `target_color` in a set created from the slice of the row `set(row[j:])`. 
* **Simplified Branching:** The `branch` function then uses this check to determine whether to return the `target_color` or the original cell value. 

Each of these versions provides a different approach to solve the problem using the DSL, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided functions.
