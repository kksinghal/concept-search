## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all input-output pairs can be described as: **"Extend each non-background object to the right, filling the space until the next non-background object or the edge of the grid is encountered."** 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '1' objects at the top and bottom rows remain unchanged.
* The '3' object extends rightward, filling the space with '1's until the rightmost '1' object.
* The '6' objects extend rightward, filling the space with '6's until the right edge of the grid. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* All objects extend rightward, filling with their respective values until encountering another object or the edge of the grid. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* All '1' objects extend rightward, filling with '1's until the next '1' or the edge of the grid.
* The '3' object remains unchanged as there are no empty spaces to its right.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL functions:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      for k in range(j+1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          I = fill(I, I[i][j], {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all non-background objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each cell of each object. For every cell, it moves rightward, filling each background cell with the object's color until it encounters a non-background cell.

**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = I[i][j]
      elif current_color is not None:
        I = fill(I, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Row-wise:** The code iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Track Current Color:** It remembers the last encountered non-background color (`current_color`).
3. **Fill Until Next Object:** If a background cell is found and `current_color` is set, it fills that cell with `current_color` until the next non-background object is encountered.

**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return rot270(fbacfcdiedeheadfjjjffhaacedajjei(rot90(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages and modifies `Program_A` to achieve the desired outcome.
1. **Rotate:** Rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90(I)`.
2. **Apply Modified Program_A:** Applies a modified version of `Program_A` that fills downwards instead of upwards.
3. **Rotate Back:** Rotates the grid 270 degrees clockwise (`rot270`) to obtain the final output.

**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    _, (i, _) = first(obj)
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I)) if index(O, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Fill:** Identifies non-background objects. For each object, it finds a representative cell and its row. It then iterates through that row, filling background cells with the object's color until reaching the end or another non-background object.

**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return dmirror(fbacfcdiedeheadfjjjffhaacedajjei(dmirror(I)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Mirror:** Mirrors the input grid diagonally using `dmirror(I)`.
2. **Apply Program_A:** Applies `Program_A` to the mirrored grid.
3. **Mirror Back:** Mirrors the result diagonally again using `dmirror` to obtain the final output.
