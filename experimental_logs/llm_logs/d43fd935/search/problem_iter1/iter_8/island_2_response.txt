## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation extends the '1' and '3' objects horizontally to the right, filling in the background ('0's) until encountering another object or the edge of the grid. The '6' objects remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The transformation extends the '7' object located at (2,3) both horizontally and vertically. Other '7' objects remain as single cells. The '8' objects are extended horizontally to the right. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The transformation extends the '1' objects vertically downwards. The other objects remain unchanged.


## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    if color(obj) == grid[i][j]:
      for k in range(j + 1, width(grid)):
        if grid[i][k] == bg:
          grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j], {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The `objects` function identifies distinct objects in the grid. 
2. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Horizontal Extension:** For each object, it extends it horizontally towards the right by filling the background until encountering a different color or the grid edge.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        current_color = None
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != mostcolor(grid) and current_color is None:
                current_color = val
            elif current_color is not None and val == mostcolor(grid):
                grid = fill(grid, current_color, {(i, j)})
            else:
                current_color = None
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** Iterates through each row in the grid.
2. **Track Color:**  While iterating, it remembers the non-background color it encounters (`current_color`).
3. **Fill Background:** It fills the background cells with the `current_color` until it hits another non-background color.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      if j < width(grid) - 1 and grid[i][j+1] == bg:
        grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j], shoot((i, j), RIGHT))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects.
2. **Extend Right:** For each cell within an object, if the cell to its right is the background, it extends the object's color to the right using the `shoot` function.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid):
                grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j], {(i, k) for k in range(j, len(grid[0])) if grid[i][k] == mostcolor(grid)})
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Cells:** Iterates over each cell in the grid.
2. **Horizontal Fill:** If a cell is not the background color, it fills all subsequent background cells in the same row with that color.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    max_j = rightmost(obj)
    grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j) for i, j in product(range(height(grid)), range(min_j, max_j + 1)) if grid[i][j] == mostcolor(grid)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to versions 1 and 3, it identifies objects.
2. **Horizontal Fill Between Extremes:** For each object, it determines the leftmost and rightmost columns and fills all background cells within that horizontal range with the object's color.
