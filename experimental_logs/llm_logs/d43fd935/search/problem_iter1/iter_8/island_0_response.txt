## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending the rightmost part of each foreground object to the right edge of the grid, effectively filling the horizontal space occupied by the object with its color. The transformation maintains the original height and vertical position of each object.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' object at the top left corner remains unchanged as it already touches the right edge. The '1' at the bottom left extends to the right, filling the entire bottom row. The '6' objects extend rightward, filling the space to the grid's edge while maintaining their original vertical positions.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, objects like '7' and '8' are extended rightward to the grid edge, preserving their vertical alignment and filling the horizontal space they occupied.
* **Input_2:**  The '1' and '3' objects follow the same pattern â€“ extending rightward to the grid's edge while keeping their original vertical placement. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), 
                                                frozenset((i, j) 
                                                          for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                                                          for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(grid)))),
                           objects(grid, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with the most common color (background).
2. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:**  Extracts foreground objects from the grid, considering them as connected components (True, False), and excluding the background (True).
3. **`apply(lambda obj: ... , objects(grid, True, False, True))`:** Applies a lambda function to each extracted object.
4. **`recolor(color(obj), frozenset((i, j) ...))`:** Recolors a set of indices with the color of the current object.
5. **`frozenset((i, j) for i in range(...) for j in range(...))`:** Generates a set of indices representing the extension area. It iterates through rows from the object's top to bottom and columns from the object's leftmost point to the grid's right edge.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the extended objects into a single object.
7. **`paint(...)`:**  Paints the merged object onto the blank canvas, resulting in the final transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    rightmost_x = rightmost(obj)
    extension = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in product(range(height(grid)), range(rightmost_x, width(grid))) if index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcommon(grid) and any(i == row and col <= j for row, col in toindices(obj)))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj | recolor(color(obj), extension))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))`:** Creates an empty canvas.
2. **`for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):`:** Iterates through foreground objects.
3. **`rightmost_x = rightmost(obj)`:** Stores the rightmost x-coordinate of the current object.
4. **`extension = frozenset(...)`:**  Calculates the extension area.
   - `product(range(height(grid)), range(rightmost_x, width(grid)))`: Generates all index pairs within the potential extension area (from the object's right edge to the grid's right edge).
   - The `if` condition checks if a cell is background and has a corresponding cell in the object on the same row and to its left.
5. **`paint(new_grid, obj | recolor(color(obj), extension))`:**  Paints the object and its extension onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    extension =  frozenset((i,j) for i, j in product(range(height(grid)), range(width(grid))) if (i, j) in backdrop(obj) and j >= rightmost(obj) and index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcommon(grid))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj | recolor(color(obj), extension))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))`:**  Initializes a blank canvas.
2. **`for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):`:** Iterates over foreground objects.
3. **`extension = frozenset(...)`:**  Determines the extension area.
   - `product(range(height(grid)), range(width(grid)))`:  Creates all possible index pairs within the grid.
   - The `if` condition checks if the index is within the object's bounding box, to the right of the object's rightmost point, and has the background color.
4. **`paint(new_grid, obj | recolor(color(obj), extension))`:** Paints the object and its extension on the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    extension = mfilter(product(range(height(grid)), range(rightmost(obj), width(grid))), lambda ij: index(grid, ij) == mostcommon(grid) and any(i == ij[0] and j < ij[1] for i, j in toindices(obj)))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj | recolor(color(obj), extension))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))`:** Creates an empty canvas.
2. **`for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):`:**  Iterates through each foreground object.
3. **`extension = mfilter(...)`:** Calculates the extension area.
   - `product(range(height(grid)), range(rightmost(obj), width(grid)))`: Generates all index pairs in the potential extension area.
   - `mfilter` filters these indices, keeping only those that are background and have a corresponding object cell on the same row to their left.
4. **`paint(new_grid, obj | recolor(color(obj), extension))`:** Paints the object and its extension onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    obj_indices = toindices(obj)
    extension = frozenset((row, col) 
                           for row, _ in obj_indices 
                           for col in range(rightmost(obj_indices), width(grid)) 
                           if (row, col) not in obj_indices and index(grid, (row, col)) == mostcommon(grid))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj | recolor(color(obj), extension))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid))`:** Creates a blank canvas.
2. **`for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):`:** Iterates through each foreground object.
3. **`obj_indices = toindices(obj)`:** Extracts the indices of the current object.
4. **`extension = frozenset(...)`:**  Calculates the extension area. 
   -  It iterates through rows where the object exists and columns from its rightmost point to the grid's edge. 
   - It includes indices that are not part of the object itself but have the background color.
5. **`paint(new_grid, obj | recolor(color(obj), extension))`:** Paints the object and its extension onto the canvas. 

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same grid transformation. They utilize various DSL functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
