## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**General Rule:** For each non-background color in the input grid, extend that color rightwards from the rightmost occurrence of that color until encountering a different non-background color or reaching the edge of the grid.

**Examples:**

* **Input 0:** The rightmost '1' is extended rightwards, filling the space previously occupied by the '6'.  Similarly, the '3's are extended rightwards.
* **Input 1:**  The '7's and '8's are extended rightwards, filling the space previously occupied by the '3's. 
* **Input 2:** The '1's are extended rightwards. The '3's remain unchanged as they are already reaching another non-background color.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    c = color(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(rightmost_j + 1, width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (uppermost(obj), j)) != bg:
        break
      grid = fill(grid, c, {(uppermost(obj), j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Identify Background:** Determine the most frequent color in the grid, representing the background.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each unique object (connected cells of the same color) excluding the background.
3. **Extend Rightwards:** Starting from the column next to the rightmost point of the object, iterate rightwards.
4. **Fill Until Non-Background:** If the current cell is the background color, fill it with the object's color. Stop extending when encountering a non-background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for x in palette(grid) - {mostcommon(grid)}:
    obj = argmax(colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, True), x), rightmost)
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(grid)):
        if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcommon(grid):
          break
        if (i, j) in backdrop(obj):
          grid = fill(grid, x, {(i, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors:** Loop through each color in the grid, excluding the background color.
2. **Find Rightmost Object:**  For each color, find the object that extends furthest to the right.
3. **Fill Within Backdrop:**  Iterate through all grid cells. If a cell lies within the backdrop of the rightmost object of the current color and is a background color, fill it with the current color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    target_j = width(grid)
    for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(grid)):
      if any(index(grid, (i, j)) != bg for i in range(height(grid))):
        target_j = j
        break
    grid = fill(grid, color(obj), product(range(height(grid)), range(rightmost(obj) + 1, target_j)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** Determine the background color.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object (excluding the background).
3. **Find Stopping Column:** Determine the first column from the rightmost object onwards that contains a non-background color.
4. **Fill Rectangular Region:**  Fill the rectangular region from the right of the object to the determined stopping column with the object's color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    c = color(obj)
    j = rightmost(obj) + 1
    while j < width(grid) and all(grid[i][j] == mostcommon(grid) for i in range(height(grid))):
      grid = fill(grid, c, {(i, j) for i in range(height(grid))})
      j += 1
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object (excluding the background).
2. **Extend Rightwards:** Starting from the column right of the object, continue as long as the entire column consists of the background color.
3. **Fill Column:** Fill the current column with the object's color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcommon(grid)
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      j = rightmost(obj) + 1
      while j < width(grid) and grid[i][j] == bg and (i, j) in backdrop(obj):
        grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})
        j += 1
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** Determine the background color.
2. **Iterate through Objects:**  Loop through each object (excluding the background).
3. **Extend from Each Row:** For each row within the object's bounding box, start from the rightmost point of the object and extend rightwards.
4. **Fill Until Non-Background or Outside Backdrop:** Fill with the object's color as long as the current cell is a background color and within the object's bounding box.
