## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to follow these rules:

* **Line Extension:**  Identify horizontal and vertical lines formed by connected cells of the same color (excluding the background color).
* **Extend Until Obstruction:** Extend these lines in their respective directions until they encounter another object (any color different from the background). 
* **No Diagonal Extension:** Lines do not extend diagonally.
* **Background Remains:** The background color remains unchanged throughout the transformation.

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's look at Input_0 and Output_0 to illustrate:

* The horizontal line of '3's is extended rightward until it hits the '1'.
* The vertical line of '1's is extended downward until it hits the '6'.
* Notice how the background of '0's remains untouched.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using functions from the provided DSL:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)  # Find objects, exclude background
    bg = mostcolor(grid)  # Identify the background color
    for obj in objs:
        if vline(obj): # Check if object is a vertical line
            for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1): 
                for i in range(lowermost(obj) + 1, len(grid)):  # Extend downwards
                    if index(grid, (i, j)) != bg:  # Stop if encountering a non-background color
                        break
                    grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})  # Fill with object color
        elif hline(obj): # Check if object is a horizontal line
            for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
                for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(grid[0])): # Extend rightwards
                    if index(grid, (i, j)) != bg:  # Stop if encountering a non-background color
                        break
                    grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j)}) # Fill with object color
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Background:**  Finds all objects (connected cells of the same color) and the background color in the grid.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:**  Loops through each identified object.
3. **Line Check and Extension:**  For each object, it checks if it's a vertical or horizontal line. 
    * **Vertical Line:** Extends the line downward cell by cell, stopping if it encounters a cell that's not the background color.
    * **Horizontal Line:** Extends the line rightward cell by cell, stopping at non-background cells.
4. **Grid Update:** The grid is updated within the loop after each line extension.


### Program Version 2: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    for direction in [DOWN, RIGHT]:  # Iterate for vertical and horizontal extension
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):  # Check for non-background color
                    current_color = index(grid, (i, j)) 
                    next_loc = add((i, j), direction)  # Calculate the next location in the direction
                    while 0 <= next_loc[0] < len(grid) and 0 <= next_loc[1] < len(grid[0]) and index(grid, next_loc) == mostcolor(grid):
                        grid = fill(grid, current_color, {next_loc})
                        next_loc = add(next_loc, direction)  # Move to the next location
    return grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Directional Iteration:** Iterates through the grid twice, once for downward extension (DOWN) and once for rightward extension (RIGHT).
2. **Non-Background Color Check:**  Identifies cells with colors different from the background.
3. **Line Extension:** From each non-background cell, extends the line in the current direction until it hits a non-background color or the grid boundary.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0])
    bg = mostcolor(grid)
    def extend_line(start, direction):
        i, j = start
        while 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and grid[i][j] == bg:  
            grid = fill(grid, color(toobject({start}, grid)), {(i, j)})
            i, j = add((i, j), direction)
        return grid
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if grid[i][j] != bg:  
                grid = extend_line((i, j), DOWN)  # Extend downwards
                grid = extend_line((i, j), RIGHT)  # Extend rightwards
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_line` Function:** Defines a helper function to extend a line from a given starting point in a specified direction until it encounters a non-background color or the grid boundary.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** Iterates through each cell, and for non-background cells, calls `extend_line` to extend lines both downwards and rightwards.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def extend(grid, is_vertical):
    new_grid = tuple(list(row) for row in grid)  # Make a mutable copy
    for i in range(len(grid) - 1) if is_vertical else range(len(grid[0]) - 1):
      for j in range(len(grid[0])) if is_vertical else range(len(grid)):
        if is_vertical:
          if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid) and grid[i + 1][j] == mostcolor(grid):
            new_grid[i + 1][j] = grid[i][j]
        else:
          if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid) and grid[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(grid):
            new_grid[i][j + 1] = grid[i][j]
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)  # Convert back to immutable tuples

  grid = extend(grid, True)  # Extend vertically
  return extend(grid, False)  # Extend horizontally 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend` Function:** Defines a helper function to handle line extensions. It takes the grid and a boolean flag (`is_vertical`) to indicate the extension direction.
2. **Mutable Grid Copy:** Creates a mutable copy of the grid to enable in-place modifications during extension.
3. **Directional Extension:**  Performs the extension either vertically or horizontally based on the `is_vertical` flag, filling background cells with the color of the preceding non-background cell.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    def fill_direction(grid, direction):
        for i in range(len(grid) - direction[0]):
            for j in range(len(grid[0]) - direction[1]):
                if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid) and grid[i + direction[0]][j + direction[1]] == mostcolor(grid):
                    grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j], {(i + direction[0], j + direction[1])})
        return grid
    grid = fill_direction(grid, (1, 0))  # Fill downwards
    grid = fill_direction(grid, (0, 1))  # Fill rightwards
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_direction` Function:** Defines a function that fills cells in a specified direction. It takes the grid and a direction tuple (e.g., (1, 0) for downwards) as input.
2. **Directional Filling:**  Iterates through the grid and fills background cells that are adjacent to non-background cells in the specified direction.


**Note:** These code examples demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. The choice of which version to use may depend on factors like readability, efficiency, or personal preference.
