## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve extending objects horizontally towards another object with the same color. The extension stops when it encounters a different colored object or the edge of the grid. 

Let's break down each example for a clearer understanding:

**Example 0:**

- The '1' objects extend rightwards until they hit the '3' and '6' objects respectively.
- The '6' objects extend rightwards until they hit the edge of the grid.

**Example 1:**

- The '7' object in the top-left corner extends rightward until it reaches the '8' object.
- The '8' objects extend rightwards until they hit the edge of the grid.
- The '7' objects on the left edge extend rightwards until they hit the '3' and '8' objects respectively.

**Example 2:**

- The '1' objects extend rightwards until they hit the edge of the grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with a detailed explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize the output grid
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False): # Iterate over each object
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj) # Find the rightmost column of the object
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # Iterate over rows containing the object
      for j in range(rightmost_j + 1, len(I[0])): # Iterate over columns to the right of the object
        if index(I, (i, j)) == 0: # Check if the cell is empty
          O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))}) # Fill the cell with the object color
        else:
          break # Stop extending if a non-zero cell is encountered
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Find the rightmost column:** For each object, it determines the rightmost occupied column.
3. **Extend horizontally:**  It then iterates over each row containing the object and checks if the cells to the right of the object are empty. If empty, it fills them with the object's color until it encounters a non-empty cell.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Initialize an empty output grid
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False): # Iterate over each object
    for i, j in toindices(obj): # Iterate over cells in the object
      O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))}) # Paint the object onto the output grid
      for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])): # Extend rightward from each cell
        if index(I, (i, k)) == 0: # Check if the cell is empty
          O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, k))}) # Fill the empty cell
        else:
          break # Stop if a non-empty cell is found
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize empty grid:** Starts with an empty canvas of the same size as the input.
2. **Paint objects onto canvas:**  Paints each object onto the canvas.
3. **Extend rightward from each cell:** Extends the object rightward from each of its constituent cells, stopping when it encounters a non-empty cell. This approach avoids iterating over rows explicitly.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output grid
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False): # Iterate over each object
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # Iterate over rows containing the object
      extension = connect((i, rightmost(obj)), (i, len(I[0]) - 1)) # Line from rightmost point to the edge
      for ex_i, ex_j in extension:
        if index(I, (ex_i, ex_j)) == 0:
          O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (ex_i, ex_j))})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and find rightmost:** Similar to previous versions, it iterates over objects and finds the rightmost point.
2. **Create extension line:**  Instead of iterating through columns, it generates a "line" of indices representing the potential extension area.
3. **Fill along the line:** It then iterates through this line, filling in cells with the object's color until it encounters a non-empty cell.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      current_j = j + 1
      while current_j < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, current_j)) == 0:
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, current_j))})
        current_j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and paint:** Iterates through objects and paints them onto the output grid.
2. **While loop for extension:** Uses a while loop to extend the object from each cell to the right. The loop continues as long as the current cell is empty and within the grid boundaries. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    right_edge =  [(i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)]
    for i, j in right_edge:
      ray = shoot((i, j), (0, 1)) # Shoot a ray rightward
      for r_i, r_j in ray:
        if r_j < len(I[0]) and index(I, (r_i, r_j)) == 0:
          O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (r_i, r_j))})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find right edge:**  Finds the right edge of each object.
2. **Shoot ray:**  From each point on the right edge, it "shoots" a ray towards the right edge of the grid. 
3. **Fill along the ray:** The ray acts as a guide, and the code fills cells with the object's color until it encounters a non-empty cell or the grid's edge.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing diverse use of the DSL functions and providing a range of potential solutions.
