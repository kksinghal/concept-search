## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally to the right, until they encounter another object or the grid border. The color of the extended cells remains the same as the original object. 

**Input 0:** 
- The '1' objects are extended rightward.
- The '3' object is extended rightward.
- The '6' objects are extended rightward.

**Input 1:** 
- The '7' objects are extended rightward.
- The '3' object is extended rightward.
- The '8' objects are extended rightward.

**Input 2:** 
- The '1' objects are extended rightward.
- The '3' object is extended rightward.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with a different approach:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program A's use of `shoot` and object manipulation)

```python
def solve_97999447(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    extended_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        extension = shoot((i, j), RIGHT)
        for ei, ej in extension:
          if 0 <= ei < height(I) and 0 <= ej < width(I) and index(I, (ei, ej)) == mostcolor(I):
            extended_objs.add((v, (ei, ej)))
          else:
            break
    return paint(I, frozenset(extended_objs))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects (connected components) in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`extended_objs = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store the extended objects.
3. **Iterate through each object and its cells:**
   - **`extension = shoot((i, j), RIGHT)`:** Generates a line of indices extending rightward from each object cell.
   - **Inner loop:** Checks each cell on the extension line.
     - If the cell is within the grid bounds and has the background color, it's added to the `extended_objs` set.
     - If the cell is outside the grid or encounters a non-background color, the extension process for that line stops.
4. **`return paint(I, frozenset(extended_objs))`:** Paints the extended objects onto the original grid and returns the result.

**Version 2:** (Using `hfrontier` for extension and set operations)

```python
def solve_97999447(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  extended_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in obj:
      _, (i, j) = cell
      extended_indices |= set(toindices(intersection(hfrontier((i, j)), asindices(I)))) - toindices(obj)
  return fill(I, mostcolor(I), extended_indices)
```

**Explanation:**
1.  Identify objects and initialize an empty set for extended indices.
2.  Iterate through objects and their cells.
3.  Use `hfrontier` to get a horizontal line of indices.
4.  Intersect the frontier with valid grid indices (`asindices(I)`) to stay within bounds.
5.  Remove the original object indices from the frontier to avoid extending onto itself.
6.  Add the remaining indices (the extension) to `extended_indices`.
7.  Fill the extended indices with the background color using `fill`.

**Version 3:** (Emphasizes grid manipulation and column-wise processing)

```python
def solve_97999447(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = [[v for v in r] for r in I] 
    for j in range(w - 1):
        for i in range(h):
            if O[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and O[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
                O[i][j + 1] = O[i][j]
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**
1. Create a copy (`O`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. Iterate through each column (except the last) from left to right.
3. For each cell in a column, check if:
   - It's not the background color.
   - The cell to its right is the background color.
4. If both conditions are true, extend the object by coloring the right cell with the current cell's color.
5. Convert the modified 2D list `O` back to a tuple of tuples (grid format) and return.

**Version 4:** (Leveraging `hsplit` for parallel processing of grid segments)

```python
def solve_97999447(I):
    segments = hsplit(I, width(I)) 
    extended_segments = []
    for segment in segments:
        if len(palette(segment)) > 1: 
            extended_segments.append(tuple(segment[0])) 
        else:
            extended_segments.append(segment[0]) 
    return hconcat(*extended_segments) 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`segments = hsplit(I, width(I))`**: Splits the input grid into individual columns.
2. **`extended_segments = []`**: Initializes an empty list to store the modified segments.
3. **Loop through each `segment`:**
   - **`if len(palette(segment)) > 1:`**: If the segment has more than one color (meaning it's not just background), extend the object in that segment to the right.
     - **`extended_segments.append(tuple(segment[0]))`**:  Adds the first row (which now contains the extended color) of the segment to `extended_segments`.
   - **`else:`**: If the segment is only background color, no extension is needed.
     -  **`extended_segments.append(segment[0])`**: Adds the segment's row as is.
4. **`return hconcat(*extended_segments)`**: Concatenates the modified segments horizontally to form the final output grid.

**Version 5:** (Focuses on object boundaries and filling)

```python
def solve_97999447(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  to_fill = set()
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      for k in range(j + 1, rightmost_col + 1):
        if (i, k) not in toindices(obj) and index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          to_fill.add((i, k))
  return fill(I, mostcolor(I), to_fill)
```

**Explanation:**
1. Identifies objects in the grid.
2. Initializes an empty set (`to_fill`) to store the indices that need to be filled.
3. For each object:
   - Finds the rightmost column index of that object.
   - For each cell in the object:
     - Iterates through the cells to the right within the object's horizontal span.
     - If a cell is not part of the object but has the background color, add its index to `to_fill`.
4. Finally, fills all the collected indices in `to_fill` with the background color. 

These five versions provide distinct solutions to the problem using different combinations of DSL functions. They demonstrate the flexibility of the DSL and the various ways to approach spatial reasoning tasks.
