## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in these examples seems to be extending objects horizontally towards the right, filling the space between the object and the next non-zero digit to the right. Let's break it down for each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '3' object extends right to fill the spaces until the '1' object. 
* The '6' objects extend right until the edge of the grid.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The '7' object in the third row extends right to reach the '3' object.
* The '8' objects in the third and seventh rows extend right to the edge of the grid.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The '1' objects extend rightward, filling the space until the next '1' or the edge.
* The '3' object extends right to the edge of the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        k = j + 1
        while k < len(I[0]) and I[i][k] == 0:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and columns:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify non-zero cells:** It checks if the current cell is non-zero (`I[i][j] != 0`).
3. **Extend rightward:**  If a non-zero cell is found, it moves to the right (`k = j + 1`) and continues as long as it encounters zero-valued cells (`I[i][k] == 0`) and hasn't reached the edge of the grid (`k < len(I[0])`).
4. **Fill with object color:** For each zero-valued cell encountered during the rightward extension, the program fills it with the color of the initial non-zero cell (`O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k)})`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, False):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})
      for k in range(leftmost_j + 1, j):
        if index(I, (i, k)) == 0:
          O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, k))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize empty canvas:** Creates a canvas `O` of the same size as the input `I` but filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate through objects:** Iterates over each object identified in the input grid (`objects(I, False, False, False)`).
3. **Get object color and leftmost column:**  Extracts the color of the current object and the column index of its leftmost cell.
4. **Paint object and extend rightward:** Paints the original object onto the canvas. Then, for each cell in the object, it extends rightward from the object's leftmost column (`leftmost_j + 1`) to the current cell's column (`j`), filling in any zero-valued cells with the object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    current_color = 0
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        current_color = I[i][j]
      elif current_color != 0:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and track color:** This version iterates through each row of the grid, maintaining a `current_color` variable. 
2. **Update color on non-zero:**  It updates this variable whenever it encounters a non-zero cell. 
3. **Fill with tracked color:** If it encounters a zero and the `current_color` is not zero, it fills that cell with `current_color`, effectively extending the previous object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, False):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    max_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(min_j, max_j):
        if I[i][j] == 0:
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:**  This version first identifies individual objects in the grid using the `objects` function.
2. **Determine object boundaries:** For each object, it determines its minimum and maximum column indices (`min_j`, `max_j`) and its row boundaries.
3. **Fill within boundaries:** It then iterates within these boundaries and fills any zero-valued cells with the object's color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    last_nonzero_j = -1
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        if last_nonzero_j != -1:
          O = fill(O, I[i][last_nonzero_j], {(i, k) for k in range(last_nonzero_j + 1, j)})
        last_nonzero_j = j
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Track last non-zero:** This version iterates through each row, remembering the column index (`last_nonzero_j`) of the last encountered non-zero cell.
2. **Fill between non-zeros:** When it finds another non-zero cell, it fills the space between the current non-zero cell and the previous one with the color of the previous cell.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Each version provides a unique perspective and demonstrates the flexibility of the DSL in solving this spatial reasoning task.
