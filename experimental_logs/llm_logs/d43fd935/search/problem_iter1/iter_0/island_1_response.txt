## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves extending specific objects horizontally to the right, effectively "filling in" the space until encountering another object or the grid's edge.  The specific rules are:

* **Object Selection:** Only certain objects are extended. The exact selection criteria isn't immediately clear, but it appears to be related to object shape and position.
* **Direction:** Objects are extended only to the right.
* **Termination:** The extension stops upon encountering another object or the grid boundary.
* **Original Object Preservation:** The original shape and position of the extended object remain unchanged. 

Let's examine each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
* The single '1' objects remain unchanged.
* The '3' object extends rightward, stopping at the right '1' object.
* The top-most '6' object remains unchanged.
* The remaining '6' objects extend rightward, stopping at the grid boundary.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The '8' objects remain unchanged.
* The top-most and bottom-most '7' objects remain unchanged.
* The remaining '7' objects extend rightward, stopping at the '3' object or the grid boundary.
* The '3' object extends rightward, stopping at the right-most '8' object.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The '3' object remains unchanged.
* All '1' objects extend rightward, stopping at the grid boundary. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Unfortunately, generating five distinct, functional programs solely based on the provided information and limited DSL functions is extremely challenging.  The exact logic for object selection remains unclear, and the DSL lacks specific functions for horizontal object extension or collision detection. 

To provide a more accurate solution, I would need additional information, such as:

* **More Examples:** Additional input-output pairs could reveal patterns in object selection.
* **Clarification of Object Selection:** Understanding which objects are chosen for extension is crucial.
* **DSL Enhancements:**  Adding functions for horizontal extension, collision detection, or object properties (e.g., connectedness) would significantly aid in program generation.

## Code Extraction:

While I cannot provide a complete solution, I can offer a program structure and potential code snippets inspired by the provided examples, assuming additional DSL functions were available:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Identify objects to be extended (requires additional logic or DSL functions)
    objects_to_extend = identify_extension_candidates(I) 

    # 2. Loop through each object to extend
    for obj in objects_to_extend:
        # 3. Extend object horizontally until collision (requires additional DSL functions)
        extended_obj = extend_right(obj, I)
        # 4. Update the grid with the extended object
        I = paint(I, extended_obj)
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **identify_extension_candidates(I):** This function would require additional logic or DSL functions to determine which objects to extend based on the desired transformation rules.
2.  **extend_right(obj, I):** This function would utilize additional DSL functions to extend the object horizontally until encountering another object or the grid boundary.

**Note:** This is a simplified representation. The actual implementation would require more complex logic and potentially the creation of helper functions using the available DSL functions.

## Similarity:

Generating five distinct versions with the current information is not feasible. Providing more context about object selection and desired behavior would be essential for achieving meaningful variations in program logic and DSL function usage.
