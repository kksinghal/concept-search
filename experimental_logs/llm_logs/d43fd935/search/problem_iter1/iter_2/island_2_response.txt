## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to focus on extending specific objects within the grid based on their original shape and alignment.  Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

* The '1' objects at the top and bottom extend horizontally to the right, filling the space until they reach another object or the grid boundary.
* The '6' objects on the left side extend vertically downwards, filling the space until they reach another object or the grid boundary.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

* The '7' objects on the left and bottom extend horizontally to the right, filling the space.
* The '8' objects on the right and top extend horizontally to the left, filling the space.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**

* The '1' objects extend vertically downwards, filling the space.

**Generalization:**

The transformation appears to follow these rules:

1. Identify distinct objects within the grid.
2. Extend these objects either horizontally or vertically based on their initial orientation (horizontal objects extend horizontally, vertical objects extend vertically).
3. The extension continues until another object or the grid boundary is encountered.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with explanations:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if hline(obj) or (width(obj) > height(obj)):
      start = leftmost(obj)
      end = rightmost(obj)
      row = uppermost(obj)
      grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(row, j) for j in range(start, end + 1)})
    elif vline(obj) or (height(obj) > width(obj)):
      start = uppermost(obj)
      end = lowermost(obj)
      col = leftmost(obj)
      grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, col) for i in range(start, end + 1)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Use `objects(grid, True, False, True)` to identify distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** Loop through each object:
    * **Determine Orientation:** Use `hline`, `vline`, `width`, and `height` functions to determine if the object is primarily horizontal or vertical.
    * **Horizontal Extension:** If horizontal, use `leftmost`, `rightmost`, and `uppermost` to determine the extension range and fill with `fill`.
    * **Vertical Extension:** If vertical, use `uppermost`, `lowermost`, and `leftmost` to determine the extension range and fill with `fill`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for i in range(len(grid)):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid):
        if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == grid[i][j]:
          grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j], {(k, j) for k in range(i, len(grid))})
        if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == grid[i][j]:
          grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j], {(i, k) for k in range(j, len(grid[0]))})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Identify Non-Background Cells:** Check if the cell is not the background color (`mostcommon(grid)`).
3. **Check Adjacent Cells:**
    * **Vertical Extension:** If the cell above has the same color, fill downwards until a different color or the edge is reached.
    * **Horizontal Extension:** If the cell to the left has the same color, fill rightwards until a different color or the edge is reached.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
        direction = (1, 0) if height(obj) > width(obj) else (0, 1)
        for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
            grid = fill(grid, v, shoot((i, j), direction))
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Use `objects` to get individual objects.
2. **Determine Extension Direction:** Check if the object is taller than it is wide, choosing a vertical direction `(1, 0)`, otherwise a horizontal direction `(0, 1)`.
3. **Fill from Every Cell:** For every cell in the object, use `shoot` to extend a line in the chosen direction, effectively filling the space until an obstacle or the grid boundary is reached.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  transposed = dmirror(grid)
  for i in range(len(transposed)):
    for j in range(len(transposed[0])):
      if transposed[i][j] != mostcommon(transposed):
        if j > 0 and transposed[i][j-1] == transposed[i][j]:
          transposed = fill(transposed, transposed[i][j], {(i, k) for k in range(j, len(transposed[0]))})
  return dmirror(transposed)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:** Use `dmirror` to transpose the grid, effectively swapping rows and columns. This simplifies the logic for horizontal extensions.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** Loop through the transposed grid, extending objects horizontally (which are now treated as vertical due to transposition).
3. **Transpose Back:** Use `dmirror` again to revert the grid back to its original orientation.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
        upper, lower = uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)
        left, right = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
        if right - left >= lower - upper:
            grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(upper, j) for j in range(left, right + 1)})
        else:
            grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, left) for i in range(upper, lower + 1)})
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Use `objects` to get individual objects.
2. **Calculate Dimensions:** Determine the object's height and width using `uppermost`, `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost`.
3. **Choose Extension:** Compare width and height. If wider than tall, extend horizontally; otherwise, extend vertically.
4. **Fill Accordingly:** Use `fill` to extend the object in the chosen direction, covering the appropriate cells.

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing various combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version provides a unique solution while adhering to the specified DSL constraints.
