## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**General Rule:** For each non-background cell, extend its value horizontally to the right, until reaching another non-background cell or the edge of the grid. 

Let's illustrate this with an example from `Input_0`:

```
Input_0:          Output_0:
1 0 0 0 ...       1 0 0 0 ...
0 0 0 0 ...       0 0 0 0 ...
0 0 3 3 ...  -->  0 0 3 3 1 1 ...
0 0 3 3 ...       0 0 3 3 0 0 ... 
0 0 0 0 ...       0 0 6 0 0 0 ...
...               ...
```

Here, the '1' on the third row extends to the right, filling the background cells until it encounters another '1'. Similarly, the '3's extend to the right until reaching the '1'.  

This rule applies to all the input-output pairs provided.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(O) and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(O):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the grid. If a cell is not the background color and its right neighbor is the background color, it fills the right neighbor with the current cell's color. This effectively extends the color to the right until encountering another non-background cell.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(width(I) - 1, 0, -1):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) and index(I, (i, j - 1)) != mostcolor(I):
        I = fill(I, index(I, (i, j - 1)), {(i, j)}) 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid from right to left. If a cell is the background color and its left neighbor is not the background color, it fills the current cell with the left neighbor's color. This approach achieves the same outcome as version 1 but with a different iteration order.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    for j in range(leftmost_j + 1, width(I)):
      if index(I, (uppermost(obj), j)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})
      else:
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all objects (connected regions of non-background colors). For each object, it iterates horizontally from its leftmost cell and fills the background cells with the object's color until encountering another non-background cell.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = mostcolor(I)
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
      O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version creates a blank canvas filled with the background color. It then iterates through the grid, remembering the last encountered non-background color. It fills each cell with the remembered color, effectively extending the color horizontally. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(1, width(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(O) and index(O, (i, j - 1)) != mostcolor(O):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j - 1)), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid. If a cell is the background color and its left neighbor is not, it fills the current cell with the left neighbor's color. This effectively spreads the non-background colors to the right. 


All these programs achieve the same goal of horizontally extending non-background colors to the right until encountering another non-background cell. They differ in their approaches, iteration order, and use of DSL functions, making them distinct solutions to the problem.
