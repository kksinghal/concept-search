## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally to the right until they hit another object or the edge of the grid. 

**Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:**  The '3' object extends right to hit the '1', the lone '6' on the 6th row extends right to hit the other '6', and so on. 
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:** The '7' objects extend right,  the top '8' extends right to hit the edge, and the bottom '7' remains unchanged as it's already touching the edge.
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:** The '1' objects remain unchanged as they are either touching other objects or the edge. The '3' objects also remain the same.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      j = leftmost(obj)
      while j < len(I[0]) and (i, j) not in toindices(obj) and index(I, (i, j)) == 0:
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})
        j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each univalued object in the input grid.
2. **Iterate through rows:** For each row within the object's bounding box.
3. **Extend right:** Starting from the object's leftmost column, move right, painting with the object's color until hitting a non-zero cell or reaching the grid's edge.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    current_color = 0
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        current_color = I[i][j]
      O = paint(O, {(current_color, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output:** Create an empty canvas of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate row-wise:** Go through each row of the input.
3. **Track current color:** Store the most recently encountered non-zero color.
4. **Paint output:** Fill the output grid with the 'current_color', effectively extending objects rightwards.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 0 and I[i][j - 1] != 0:
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j - 1], (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** Loop through each cell in the input grid (row-wise).
2. **Check for extension opportunity:** If a cell is 0 and its left neighbor is non-zero, extend the left neighbor's color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each univalued object in the input grid.
2. **Fill bounding box:**  For each object, fill its entire bounding box with its color, effectively extending it rightward.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k) for k in range(j, len(I[0]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:**  Loop through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Fill from non-zero:** If a cell is non-zero, fill all cells to its right on the same row with its color. 


These five versions provide distinct approaches using different DSL function combinations to achieve the desired object extension transformation.
