## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects in the grid and extending them horizontally to the right until they encounter another non-background object or the edge of the grid. 

**Example:**

* **Input 0:** The '1' object at (3,8) is extended rightwards, filling the spaces with '1' until it reaches the edge of the grid. The same logic applies to the '6' object at (2,8).
* **Input 1:** The '7' object at (3,4) is extended rightwards, filling with '7' until it encounters the '3' object. Similarly, the '8' objects at (3,7) and (3,8) extend rightwards until hitting the edge. 
* **Input 2:** This input demonstrates that only non-background objects are extended, as the '1' objects remain unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(grid)):
        if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcommon(grid):
          break
        if (i, j) in backdrop(obj):
          grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** Loop through each non-background object in the grid.
2. **Iterate within object bounding box:** For each object, iterate through the rows and columns within its bounding box, starting from one column to the right of its rightmost point.
3. **Check for non-background cells:** If a non-background cell is encountered, stop extending the current object in this row.
4. **Fill with object color:** If the current cell is background and within the object's bounding box, fill it with the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for x in palette(grid) - {mostcommon(grid)}:
    obj = argmax(colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, True), x), rightmost)
    grid = fill(grid, x, frozenset((i, j) 
                   for i in range(height(grid)) 
                   for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(grid))
                   if (i, j) in backdrop(obj) and index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcommon(grid)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over colors:** Loop through each non-background color in the grid.
2. **Find rightmost object:** For each color, find the object with that color having the largest rightmost coordinate.
3. **Fill area to the right:**  Fill all background cells within the object's bounding box and to the right of the object with the object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    right_edge = hfrontier((0, rightmost(obj) + 1))
    extension = right_edge & backdrop(obj)
    grid = fill(grid, color(obj), frozenset((i, j) for i, j in extension if index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcommon(grid)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** Loop through each non-background object.
2. **Define right edge:** Create a horizontal frontier starting from one column to the right of the object's rightmost point.
3. **Find extension area:** Intersect the right edge with the object's bounding box to determine the area to be filled.
4. **Fill extension area:** Fill background cells within the extension area with the object's color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    for row in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      fill_start = rightmost(obj) + 1
      for j in range(fill_start, width(grid)):
        if index(grid, (row, j)) != mostcommon(grid):
          break
        grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(row, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** Loop through each non-background object.
2. **Iterate over rows:** For each object, iterate through its rows.
3. **Find fill start:** Determine the starting column for filling by finding the rightmost point of the object in the current row.
4. **Fill until non-background:**  Fill cells with the object's color starting from the fill start column until encountering a non-background cell.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    fill_area = frozenset()
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(grid)):
        if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcommon(grid):
          break
        fill_area = fill_area | {(i, j)}
    grid = fill(grid, color(obj), fill_area)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** Loop through each non-background object.
2. **Determine fill area:**  Find all the background cells to the right of the object within its bounding box that need to be filled.
3. **Fill the area:** Fill the entire identified fill area with the object's color in one go.


These five program versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation while utilizing the provided DSL functions. Each version leverages different combinations of functions and logic flow to highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
