## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending non-background objects horizontally to the right edge of the grid while maintaining their original shape. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The '1', '3', and '6' objects are extended to the right edge of the grid. Notice how the extension fills only the background cells (value '0') and does not overwrite existing objects.

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the objects '7', '3', and '8' are extended horizontally. The extension carefully avoids overlapping any existing non-background objects.

**Input_2:**  The pattern continues, with the '1' and '3' objects extending to the right edge. Again, the extension only occurs within the background cells.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      O = fill(O, v, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates a blank canvas (`O`) filled with the background color (`mostcolor(I)`) and having the same dimensions as the input grid (`shape(I)`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object (`obj`) detected in the input grid (`I`) using `objects` function. Objects are considered connected if they are directly adjacent (not diagonal), excluding the background color.
3. **Horizontal Extension:** For every cell (`v`, `(i, j)`) within an object, it fills the canvas (`O`) with the object's color (`v`) from the cell's column (`j`) to the rightmost edge of the grid (`width(I)`), effectively extending the object horizontally.
4. **Canvas Return:** Returns the modified canvas (`O`) as the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** Instead of creating a separate canvas, this version modifies the input grid (`I`) directly and stores the result in `O`.
2. **Row-wise Iteration:**  It iterates through each row (`i`) and then each cell (`j`) within that row.
3. **First Non-Background Cell:**  Upon encountering a non-background cell, it fills the row from that cell's column to the right edge with the cell's color.
4. **Row Break:** After extending the first non-background object in a row, it breaks the inner loop (`break`) to avoid extending any subsequent objects in the same row.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified grid (`O`) as output. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return hconcat(*[tuple(row[0] if len(set(row)) == 1 else row for row in hsplit(I, 1))])
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Horizontal Split:** The `hsplit(I, 1)` function splits the input grid (`I`) into single-column segments.
2. **Segment Extension:**  For each segment (`row`), if all cells in the segment have the same value (implying a single object or background), it creates a new segment consisting only of the first element (`row[0]`) repeated to match the original width. Otherwise, the original segment is kept.
3. **Horizontal Concatenation:** The extended segments are then horizontally concatenated using `hconcat` to form the output grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(v if (i, j) in obj else mostcolor(I) for j, v in enumerate(row))
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
      for obj in [set((i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcolor(I)][0:1] 
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inline Extension:** This version performs the extension directly within the list comprehension used to generate the output grid.
2. **Row and Object Iteration:** It iterates through each row (`i`, `row`) of the input grid (`I`). Within each row, it identifies the first non-background object and generates indices (`obj`) representing the extension of that object to the right edge.
3. **Conditional Filling:** For each cell (`i`, `j`), it checks if the cell's index is present in the generated object indices (`obj`). If yes, it retains the cell's original value (`v`); otherwise, it fills it with the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(k, j) for k in range(i, height(I))})
  return rot90(rot90(rot90(O))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotation Strategy:** This version cleverly utilizes rotation to apply the horizontal extension vertically and then rotate the result back.
2. **Vertical Extension:**  It iterates through columns (`j`) and then rows (`i`) to extend the first non-background object in each column downwards.
3. **Triple Rotation:** The resulting grid (`O`) is then rotated three times counter-clockwise using `rot90` to achieve the desired horizontal extension.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
