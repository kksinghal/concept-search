## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves extending certain objects horizontally to the right, filling in any background (most common color) cells in their path. The extension stops when it encounters another non-background cell.

**Input_0:** The '1' on row 4 and the '6's on rows 7 and 8 are extended to the right.

**Input_1:** The '7' on row 3 and the '8's on row 3 and row 7 are extended to the right.

**Input_2:** All occurrences of '1' are extended to the right.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) and I[i][j+1] == mostcommon(I):
        k = j + 1
        while k < len(I[0]) and I[i][k] == mostcommon(I):
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and columns:** The program iterates over each cell in the grid.
2. **Identify extension points:**  It checks if a cell is not the background color and its right neighbor is the background color. This identifies potential starting points for extension.
3. **Extend horizontally:** It extends the object to the right by filling in the background cells until it encounters a non-background cell.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])):
        if (i, k) in toindices(obj) or I[i][k] != mostcommon(I):
          break
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** It identifies all objects in the grid excluding the background using the `objects` function.
2. **Iterate within objects:** For each object, it iterates through its cells.
3. **Extend horizontally:**  It extends the object horizontally from each cell to the right, filling background cells until reaching another object cell or a non-background cell.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1, 0, -1):
      if I[i][j] == mostcommon(I) and I[i][j - 1] != mostcommon(I):
        k = j - 1
        while k >= 0 and I[i][k] == mostcommon(I):
          O = fill(O, I[i][j - 1], {(i, k)})
          k -= 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate in reverse:** This version iterates through the grid rows from left to right and columns from right to left.
2. **Identify extension points:** It checks if a cell is the background color and its left neighbor is not.
3. **Extend horizontally (reversed):** It fills in background cells with the color of the left neighbor, effectively extending the object to the right.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    current_color = None
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != mostcommon(I) and current_color is None:
        current_color = value
      elif value == mostcommon(I) and current_color is not None:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
      else:
        current_color = None
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and track color:** This version iterates row-wise, keeping track of the last encountered non-background color.
2. **Fill background cells:** If it encounters a background cell while tracking a color, it fills it with that color.
3. **Reset tracking:** If it encounters a non-background cell different from the tracked color, it resets the tracked color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(tuple(v if v != mostcommon(I) else next((I[i][k] for k in range(j-1, -1, -1) if I[i][k] != mostcommon(I)), v) 
                 for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List comprehension:** Uses nested list comprehension for a more compact representation.
2. **Find closest left color:**  For each background cell, it searches for the closest non-background color to its left.
3. **Fill or retain:**  It fills the cell with the found color or retains its value if it's not a background cell.

These five distinct versions all achieve the required transformation by employing different logic and function combinations from the provided DSL.
