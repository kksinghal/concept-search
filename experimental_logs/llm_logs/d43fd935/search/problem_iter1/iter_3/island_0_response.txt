## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected horizontally or vertically) of the same color, excluding the background color (most frequent color). Then, for each object, the transformation extends the object horizontally to the right until it encounters another object or the edge of the grid.

**Input 0:**
- The '1' objects at the top and bottom are extended to the right.
- The '3' object is extended to the right.
- The '6' objects are not extended as they are already touching other objects or the edge.

**Input 1:**
- The '7' and '8' objects are extended to the right until they hit another object.
- The '3' object is already touching another object, so it's not extended.

**Input 2:**
- The vertical '1' object is extended to the right until it reaches the other '1' object.
- The '3' object is not extended as it's already touching the edge.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1**

```python
def dgieicbadifeeidajbefaeffbjdcddai(I):
  for x in palette(I):
    if x == mostcommon(I): continue
    obj = argmax(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), x), rightmost)
    I = fill(I, x, {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I)) if (i, j) in backdrop(obj)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors:** The code iterates through each distinct color (`x`) present in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Skip Background:** If the current color is the most common color (background), it's skipped.
3. **Find Rightmost Object:** For each color, it finds the object (`obj`) located furthest to the right using `argmax` and `rightmost`.
4. **Extend Rightward:** The code then fills the grid (`I`) with the current color (`x`) from the right edge of the rightmost object (`rightmost(obj) + 1`) to the right edge of the grid (`width(I)`), but only within the vertical bounds of the object (`backdrop(obj)`).
5. **Return Transformed Grid:** Finally, the transformed grid (`I`) is returned.

**Version 2**

```python
def dgieicbadifeeidajbefaeffbjdcddai(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == mostcommon(I): continue
    right_edge = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(right_edge + 1, width(I)):
      for i in range(height(I)):
        if (i, j) in backdrop(obj) and I[i][j] == mostcommon(I):
          I = fill(I, c, {(i, j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`) identified in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Skip Background Objects:** If the object's color is the background color, it's skipped.
3. **Find Right Edge:** Determine the rightmost column index (`right_edge`) of the current object.
4. **Extend to the Right:**  Iterate through columns from `right_edge + 1` to the grid's right edge (`width(I)`). For each column:
    - Iterate through all rows (`height(I)`).
    - If a cell at `(i, j)` is within the object's vertical bounds (`backdrop(obj)`) and has the background color, fill it with the object's color (`c`).
5. **Return Modified Grid:** After processing all objects, return the modified grid.

**Version 3**

```python
def dgieicbadifeeidajbefaeffbjdcddai(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    x = color(obj)
    for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I)):
      I = fill(I, x, intersection(backdrop(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(height(I))}))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`) identified in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Get Object Color:** It retrieves the color (`x`) of the current object.
3. **Extend Rightward:** For each column (`j`) from the right edge of the object (`rightmost(obj) + 1`) to the grid's right edge (`width(I)`):
    - It finds the intersection (`intersection`) between the object's backdrop (`backdrop(obj)`) and the current column (`{(i, j) for i in range(height(I))}`).
    - The grid (`I`) is then filled with the object's color (`x`) at the intersection points.
4. **Return Modified Grid:**  After processing all objects and extending them rightward, the modified grid (`I`) is returned.

**Version 4**

```python
def dgieicbadifeeidajbefaeffbjdcddai(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == mostcolor(grid): continue
    j = rightmost(obj) + 1
    while j < width(grid):
      fill_indices = {(i, j) for i in range(height(grid)) if (i, j) in backdrop(obj)}
      if len(fill_indices) == 0: break
      grid = fill(grid, color(obj), fill_indices)
      j += 1
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`) found in the grid.
2. **Skip Background Objects:**  If an object's color is the same as the background color, it's skipped.
3. **Extend Rightward:** For each non-background object:
    - Initialize a column index `j` starting from the column to the right of the object's rightmost point (`rightmost(obj) + 1`).
    - Enter a loop that continues as long as `j` is within the grid's width (`j < width(grid)`):
        - Calculate `fill_indices`:  This set will contain the indices of cells in the current column (`j`) that are within the object's vertical bounds (`backdrop(obj)`).
        - Break the loop if there are no cells to fill in the current column (`len(fill_indices) == 0`).
        - Fill the cells at `fill_indices` with the object's color.
        - Move to the next column (`j += 1`).
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Finally, the modified grid is returned after processing all objects.

**Version 5**

```python
def dgieicbadifeeidajbefaeffbjdcddai(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(grid)):
        if (i, j) in backdrop(obj):
          grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})
        else:
          break  # Stop extending horizontally if outside backdrop
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object (`obj`) detected in the input grid (`grid`).
2. **Iterate within Object Bounds:**  For each object:
    - Iterate through rows (`i`) from the object's top row (`uppermost(obj)`) to its bottom row (`lowermost(obj)`).
    - For each row, iterate through columns (`j`) starting from the column to the right of the object (`rightmost(obj) + 1`) to the right edge of the grid (`width(grid)`).
3. **Conditional Filling:**  Inside the nested loops, for each cell at (`i`, `j`):
    - If the cell is within the object's bounding box (`(i, j) in backdrop(obj)`), fill it with the object's color using `fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})`.
    - If the cell is outside the object's bounding box, break the inner loop (`break`) as we don't need to extend further in this row.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** After processing all objects and potentially filling cells to their right, return the modified grid.
