## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves extending each object horizontally to the right, until it encounters another object or reaches the edge of the grid. The color of the extended cells remains the same as the original object. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The "1" objects at the top-left and bottom-left corners remain unchanged as they are already at the grid edge. The "3 3" object extends rightward to become "3 3 1 1 1 1 1". The "6" objects extend rightward, maintaining their shape until encountering another "6" or the grid edge.

**Pair 1:** Similar to Pair 0, objects extend rightward. For instance, the top-most "8" becomes "8 8 8" after encountering the rightmost "8".  The "7" objects at (1, 1) and (8, 1) extend to the right edge of the grid.

**Pair 2:** In this case, the "1" objects extending rightward encounter either another "1" or the grid edge. The "3 3" object remains unchanged as it is blocked on the right.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL functions:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])):
        if index(I, (i, k)) == 0:
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** The program iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate over object cells:**  For each cell `(i, j)` within an object:
3. **Extend rightward:** It checks for empty cells (value 0) to the right of the current cell.
4. **Fill with object color:** If an empty cell is found, it is filled with the object's color using `fill`. The process continues until encountering a non-empty cell or the grid edge.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        current_color = I[i][j]
        for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])):
          if I[i][k] == 0:
            O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, k)})
          else:
            break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over grid cells:** This version iterates directly over each cell `(i, j)` of the input grid.
2. **Check for non-empty cell:** If a cell has a non-zero value, it stores the value as `current_color`.
3. **Extend rightward:** Similar to Version 1, it checks for empty cells to the right and fills them with `current_color` until a non-empty cell or grid edge is encountered.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  extensions = frozenset({(color(obj), connect((i, j), (i, len(I[0]) - 1))) for obj in objs for (i, j) in toindices(obj)})
  O = I
  for value, extension in extensions:
    for i, j in extension:
      if index(O, (i, j)) == 0:
        O = fill(O, value, {(i, j)})
      else:
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate object extensions:** It first calculates the horizontal extensions for each object using `connect` function, creating lines from each object cell to the right edge of the grid.
2. **Iterate and fill:** It then iterates over these pre-calculated extensions and fills the grid with the corresponding object color using `fill`, stopping at non-empty cells or the grid edge.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    last_color = 0
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        last_color = I[i][j]
      O = fill(O, last_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Starts with an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid.
2. **Row-wise iteration:** Iterates over each row and maintains the `last_color` encountered. 
3. **Fill based on last color:**  Fills the canvas `O` with the `last_color` for each cell. This effectively extends the last encountered color to the right until a new non-zero value is encountered.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((i, rightmost_j), (i, len(I[0]) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find rightmost cell:** For each object, it identifies the rightmost cell's column index `rightmost_j`.
2. **Connect and fill:**  It uses the `connect` function to create a horizontal line from the `rightmost_j` to the grid edge and fills this line with the object's color using `fill`.
