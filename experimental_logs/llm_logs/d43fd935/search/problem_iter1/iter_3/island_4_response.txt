## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples seems to be the same:

**Transformation Logic:** 

1. **Identify Non-Background Objects:** Identify all objects (connected components of the same digit) on the grid, excluding the most frequent digit, which is considered the background.
2. **Horizontal Extension:** Extend each non-background object horizontally towards the right until it either reaches the edge of the grid or encounters another non-background digit.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify non-background objects
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Determine the background color
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):  # Iterate horizontally from each object cell
        if index(I, (i, k)) != bg:  # Stop extension if a non-background digit is encountered
          break
        O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})  # Fill the current cell with the object's color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object and extends it cell by cell towards the right. The `index` function is used to check if the next cell is background before filling it with the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):  # Iterate through rows
        current_color = None
        for j in range(width(I)):  # Iterate through columns
            if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):  # Check for non-background color
                current_color = index(I, (i, j))  # Update current color
            elif current_color is not None:  # Fill with current color if extending
                O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid row by row. It keeps track of the "current_color" encountered on each row. If a background cell is encountered while "current_color" is not None, it implies that the cell needs to be filled to extend the object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Start with a blank canvas of background color
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
        for v, (i, _) in obj:
            O = fill(O, v, {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost_j, width(I)) if index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first creates a blank canvas filled with the background color. Then, it iterates through each object, identifies its leftmost column, and fills all background cells from that column onwards on the same row with the object's color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
            O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), connect((i, j), (i, width(I)-1)))) # Fill horizontally from each cell to the edge
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of every object and directly paints a horizontal line from that cell to the right edge of the grid, effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
                O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))}))
                break  # Move to the next row after extending an object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 2 but instead of tracking the "current_color", it directly paints a horizontal line from the first non-background cell encountered on each row to the right edge, ensuring that only the first object encountered on each row is extended.
