## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids appears to involve **extending horizontal lines of specific digits** to the right, stopping just before a different digit is encountered. Let's analyze each input-output pair to confirm this:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
* The line of '3's is extended to the right, filling the space up to the '1'.
* The line of '6's is also extended to the right.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
*  The line of '7's in the 3rd row is extended to the right, reaching the '3's and the '8'.
*  Similarly, lines of '8's are extended to the right.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
*  The vertical line of '1's is extended horizontally to the right, stopping before the last '1' on that row. 

This pattern suggests that the transformation focuses on extending horizontal lines of non-background digits until it encounters a different digit.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") based on the transformation analysis:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
        I = fill(I, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify extendable cells:** For each cell, it checks if it's not the background color and if its right neighbor is the background color.
3. **Extend the line:** If the condition is met, it fills all subsequent background cells to the right with the current cell's value, effectively extending the line.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k)})
      else:
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** The program first identifies all non-background objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate through object cells:** For each object, it iterates through its cells starting from the leftmost one.
3. **Extend horizontally:** For each cell, it extends the object to the right by filling in background cells with the object's color until it encounters a non-background cell.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, k)) for k in range(j, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create empty canvas:** The program starts by creating an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and paint:** It iterates through the input grid, and for each non-background cell, it paints a horizontal line on the canvas from that cell's position to the right, stopping before encountering a non-background cell. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        current_color = None
        j = 0
        while j < width(I):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and current_color is None:
                current_color = index(I, (i, j))
            elif current_color is not None and index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
            else:
                current_color = None
            j += 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through rows:** This version iterates through each row while tracking the current color to be extended.
2. **Track current color:** It sets `current_color` when a non-background digit is encountered and resets it to `None` when a different digit or the end of the line is reached.
3. **Fill background:**  While `current_color` is not `None`, it fills the background cells with `current_color`, effectively extending the horizontal line.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for row in range(height(I)):
    start = None
    for col in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (row, col)) != mostcolor(I) and start is None:
        start = col
      elif start is not None and index(I, (row, col)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(I, (row, start)), {(row, col)})
      else:
        start = None
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate and track:** This version iterates through the grid, tracking the starting column (`start`) of a non-background color sequence.
2. **Fill and reset:** When a background color cell is encountered after a non-background sequence, it fills that cell with the color from the starting column. The `start` is reset to `None` when a new sequence or the end of a sequence is encountered.


These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired horizontal line extension transformation while utilizing the provided DSL functions. Each version showcases different logic flow and function combinations, highlighting the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the DSL's constraints.
