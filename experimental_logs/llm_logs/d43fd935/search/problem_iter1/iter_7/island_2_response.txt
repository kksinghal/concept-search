## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects in the grid and extending them horizontally towards the rightmost cell of the object with the same color. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The single '1' object remains unchanged.
* Each '6' object extends rightwards to connect with other '6' objects on the same row.
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it's already connected to its rightmost same-colored cell.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '8' objects extend rightwards, connecting with other '8' objects on the same row. 
* A similar extension happens with '7' objects.
* The '3' object remains unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* All '1' objects extend rightwards, effectively creating a vertical line of '1's.
* The '3' object remains unchanged.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions in the provided DSL that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_e3497940(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    for obj in objs:
        rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
        for i in range(len(I)):
            if index(I, (i, rightmost_j)) == color(obj):
                I = fill(I, color(obj), connect(center(obj), (i, rightmost_j)))
    return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The program iterates through each object.
3. **Find Rightmost Cell:** `rightmost(obj)` determines the column index of the rightmost cell of the current object.
4. **Horizontal Scan:** For each row, the program checks if a cell with the same color as the object exists at the `rightmost_j` column.
5. **Connect:** If a matching color is found, `connect` creates a line of indices from the object's center to the matching cell.
6. **Fill:**  `fill` then fills this line with the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_e3497940(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      c = index(I, (i,j))
      if c != mostcolor(I):
        for k in range(j+1, width(I)):
          if index(I, (i,k)) == c:
            O = fill(O, c, connect((i,j), (i,k)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Cells:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check for Non-Background Color:** If the cell has a color different from the background color, it proceeds.
3. **Horizontal Scan:** It scans horizontally from the current cell to the right edge of the grid.
4. **Matching Color:** If a cell with the same color is found during the scan, it proceeds.
5. **Connect and Fill:**  The program connects the current cell and the matching cell with a line of the same color using `connect` and `fill` functions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_e3497940(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)+1):
            row_obj = toobject(hfrontier((i, 0)), I)
            if color(obj) in palette(row_obj):
                I = paint(I, recolor(color(obj), intersection(toindices(obj), toindices(row_obj))))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, it identifies distinct objects.
2. **Iterate Rows:** For each object, it iterates through rows where the object is present.
3. **Extract Row Object:**  `toobject` extracts the object present in the current row.
4. **Check Color Presence:** It checks if the object's color exists within the extracted row object.
5. **Recolor and Paint:** If the color is present, it recolors the overlapping indices of the object and the row object to the object's color and paints it back onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_e3497940(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(O,(i,j)) != mostcolor(I):
        for k in range(j+1, width(I)):
          if index(O,(i,k)) == index(O,(i,j)):
            O = fill(O, index(O,(i,j)), {(i,l) for l in range(j,k+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a similar approach to version 2 by iterating through each cell. However, instead of using the `connect` function, it directly fills the horizontal line between the current cell and the matching cell using a list comprehension within the `fill` function.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_e3497940(I):
    for i in range(height(I)):
        current_color = None
        fill_start = None
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and current_color != index(I, (i, j)):
                current_color = index(I, (i, j))
                fill_start = j
            elif current_color is not None and (index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) or j == width(I) - 1):
                I = fill(I, current_color, {(i, k) for k in range(fill_start, j)})
                current_color = None
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

This version optimizes the iteration process by scanning each row once and filling connected segments of the same color. It uses variables to track the current color being filled and the starting column index of the fill. This reduces redundant operations and improves efficiency.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation within the constraints of the DSL.
