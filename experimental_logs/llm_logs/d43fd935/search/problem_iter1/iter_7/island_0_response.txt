## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally to the right until they reach another object of any color (including itself) or the grid edge.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The single '1' object remains unchanged.
- The '3' object extends rightward until it hits the '1' object.
- The '6' objects extend rightward to the grid edge.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '7' and '8' objects extend rightward until they hit another object or the grid edge.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The '1' and '3' objects extend rightward until they hit another object or the grid edge. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def extend_right(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True): # Iterate over each foreground object
    right_limit = width(grid) # Initialize right limit to grid edge
    for other_obj in objects(grid, True, False, True): # Iterate over other objects
      if other_obj != obj and hmatching(obj, other_obj) and leftmost(other_obj) > leftmost(obj): # If objects are on the same row and other object is to the right
        right_limit = min(right_limit, leftmost(other_obj)) # Update right limit if necessary
    grid = fill(grid, color(obj), # Fill the grid with the object's color
                   frozenset((i, j) # At coordinates
                              for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) # For all rows the object occupies
                              for j in range(leftmost(obj), right_limit))) # From object's left edge to the calculated right limit
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
- This version iterates through each foreground object and determines its rightward extension limit by checking for other objects on the same row. 
- It then fills the grid with the object's color from its left edge to the calculated right limit.

**Version 2:**

```python
def extend_right(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid)) # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True): # Iterate over foreground objects
    extension = frozenset((i, j)
                   for i in range(height(grid))
                   for j in range(rightmost(obj), width(grid))
                   if index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcommon(grid)
                   and len({(i1, j1) for i1, j1 in toindices(obj) if i == i1 and j1 <= j}) > 0) # Find extension area
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj | recolor(color(obj), extension)) # Paint the object and its extension
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**
- This version creates a new grid initialized with the background color. 
- For each object, it calculates an "extension" area representing the empty cells to its right within the same row.
- It then paints both the original object and its extension onto the new grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def extend_right(grid):
  for x in palette(grid) - {mostcommon(grid)}: # Iterate over foreground colors
    obj = argmax(colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, True), x), rightmost) # Find the rightmost object of the color
    if obj is not None: # Check if an object of that color exists
        grid = fill(grid, x, # Fill with the color
                       frozenset((i, j) 
                                  for i in range(height(grid)) # For every row
                                  for j in range(rightmost(obj), width(grid)) # From the object's rightmost column to the grid edge
                                  if index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcommon(grid))) # If the cell is background
  return grid 
```

**Explanation:**
- This version focuses on each foreground color and finds its rightmost object. 
- It then fills the grid from that object's right edge to the grid's edge with the corresponding color, only if the cell is part of the background. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def extend_right(grid):
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid)), # Create a blank canvas
               merge([shift(obj, (0, width(grid) - rightmost(obj) - 1))  # Shift each object to the right edge
                     for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True)])) # Iterate over foreground objects
```

**Explanation:**
- This version uses a different approach by first creating a blank canvas. 
- It then shifts each object to the right edge of the grid and merges them onto the canvas, effectively achieving the desired extension.

**Version 5:**

```python
def extend_right(grid):
  bg = mostcommon(grid) # Store background color
  return tuple(tuple(bg if j < rightmost(extract(objects(grid, True, False, True), lambda obj: v == color(obj)), default= -1) else v 
                     for j, v in enumerate(row)) # Fill with background color if left of the rightmost object of the same color
                 for row in grid) # Iterate over each row
```

**Explanation:**
- This version iterates over each cell in the grid. 
- For each cell, it finds the rightmost object of the same color and checks if the current cell is located to the left of it.
- If so, it fills the cell with the background color; otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.
