## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally towards the right, stopping just before encountering another object or reaching the edge of the grid. 

**Example Breakdown:**

- **Input 0:** The '1's at (0,0) and (9,4) remain unchanged as they are already touching the left edge. The '3' objects extend right to become '3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1' and the '6' objects each extend to the right edge of the grid.
- **Input 1:** The '7' objects at (0,1) and (8,1) and '8' at (0,6) remain unchanged. Other objects ('7' at (9,6), '8' objects at (2,9), (6,1) and '3' object) extend right until encountering the edge or another object. 
- **Input 2:** The transformation essentially fills the rows with the leftmost non-zero value in that row.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each using different logic and DSL function combinations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1):
      if index(I,(i,j)) != 0 and index(I,(i,j+1)) == 0:
        O = fill(O,index(I,(i,j)),{(i,k) for k in range(j+1,width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Check for extendable object:** For each cell in the row, it checks if the current cell is non-zero and the cell to its right is zero. If true, this indicates an object that needs to be extended.
3. **Extend the object:** If an extendable object is found, the program uses the `fill` function to fill the row from the current column (j+1) to the right edge with the object's color. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    first_non_zero = next((j for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] != 0), None)
    if first_non_zero is not None:
      O = fill(O, I[i][first_non_zero], {(i,k) for k in range(first_non_zero, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Start with a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Find first non-zero:** For each row, find the column index of the first non-zero element.
3. **Fill from first non-zero:**  If a non-zero element is found, fill the row on the canvas from that column to the right edge with the color of the non-zero element.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), k) for k in range(leftmost_j, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid using `objects` function.
2. **Find leftmost point:** For each object, find its leftmost column index.
3. **Extend horizontally:** Fill the row containing the object from the leftmost column to the right edge with the object's color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != 0:
        O = fill(O, value, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
        break # Move to the next row after encountering the first non-zero value
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Fill:** This version iterates through each cell, and upon encountering a non-zero value, it fills the row from that point onwards with the non-zero value and then proceeds to the subsequent row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(row[j] if row[j] != 0 else row[k] for j in range(len(row))) 
                 for k, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension Magic:** This version leverages Python's list comprehension for a concise solution. It checks if a cell is 0; if so, it replaces it with the value at the start of its row, otherwise keeps the original value.

Each of these programs implements the described transformation using different approaches and DSL function combinations.
