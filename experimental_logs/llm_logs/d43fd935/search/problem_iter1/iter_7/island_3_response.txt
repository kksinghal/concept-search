## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all the examples follows a consistent pattern:

**For each distinct object in the input grid (identified by a unique digit):**

1. **Identify the object's rightmost column.**
2. **Extend the object horizontally to the right, filling all empty cells (value 0) with the object's color (digit).** 
3. **Stop extending when another object or the grid boundary is encountered.**

Let's illustrate this with **Input_1** and **Output_1**:

* The '7' object at the top left remains unchanged as there are no empty cells to its right.
* The top right '8' object extends to the right until it reaches the grid boundary.
* The central '7' object extends rightward until it encounters the '3' object. 
* Similarly, the other '8' objects extend to their right until they hit other objects or the grid border.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      j = rightmost(obj) + 1
      while j < len(I[0]) and I[i][j] == 0:
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
        j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Similar to `Program_B`, this iterates through each unique object in the input grid.
2. **Iterate through rows:** For each row of an object, it finds the rightmost column (`j`).
3. **Extend rightward:** It then enters a loop, incrementing `j` and filling cells with the object's color as long as it encounters empty cells and remains within the grid boundaries. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        ray = shoot((i, j), (0, 1))
        for r_i, r_j in ray:
          if r_j < len(I[0]) and I[r_i][r_j] == 0:
            O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(r_i, r_j)})
          else:
            break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** It iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Shoot a ray:** If a cell is not empty, it shoots a ray rightward from that cell.
3. **Fill along the ray:**  The ray fills all consecutive empty cells with the source cell's color until it hits a non-empty cell or the grid boundary.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    obj_right = rightmost(obj)
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, val in enumerate(row):
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj) or (j > obj_right and j <= obj_right + colorcount(obj, color(obj)) and val == 0):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** It initializes an output grid filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate through objects:**  It iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Calculate fill range:** It determines the object's rightmost column and the number of cells to fill based on its color count.
4. **Fill cells:** It iterates through all cells and fills those belonging to the object or falling within the calculated fill range with the object's color.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      k = j + 1
      while k < len(I[0]) and I[i][k] == 0:
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, k))})
        k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects and their cells:**  It iterates through each object and then each cell belonging to that object.
2. **Extend rightward from each cell:** For every object cell, it extends rightward, filling empty cells with the object's color until encountering a non-empty cell or the grid boundary.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    current_color = 0
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        current_color = I[i][j]
      elif current_color != 0:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate row-wise:** It iterates through each cell of the grid row by row.
2. **Track current color:** It keeps track of the most recently encountered non-empty cell's color (`current_color`).
3. **Fill if empty and color exists:** If it encounters an empty cell and `current_color` is not zero, it fills that cell with `current_color`.

These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation using the DSL functions. Each version leverages different combinations of functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
