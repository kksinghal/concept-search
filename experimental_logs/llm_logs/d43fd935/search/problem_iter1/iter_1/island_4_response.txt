## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to extend objects to the right until they hit another object. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The '1' objects remain unchanged.
* The '3' object extends rightwards, filling with '1's until it reaches the existing '1' object.
* The '6' objects extend rightwards, filling with '6's until they hit another '6' object or the grid border.

**Input_1:**

* Objects generally extend rightwards, filling with their own value until they reach another object.
* Notably, the '7' object at (2, 3) extends to meet the '3' object, and the rightmost '8' object extends to the edge.

**Input_2:**

* The '1' objects remain unchanged.
* The '3' object remains unchanged.

This suggests a consistent rule: **Objects expand rightwards, filling with their own value, until they encounter another object.** 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through object cells:** For each cell `(i, j)` in the current object `obj`, it enters a loop that iterates horizontally to the right (`k` from `j+1` to grid width).
3. **Check for background:**  It checks if the current cell `(i, k)` is the background color (`mostcolor(I)`). 
4. **Fill if background:** If the cell is background, it fills it with the object's color `v`.
5. **Stop at non-background:** If a non-background color is encountered, the loop breaks, preventing the object from extending through other objects.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  filled = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      filled |= {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I) and not any(intersection({(i, k)}, toindices(o)) for o in objs - {obj})}
  return fill(I, mostcolor(I), filled)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify fillable cells:** This version first identifies all cells that can be filled. It iterates through each object and cell like Version 1, but instead of directly filling, it adds the fillable cells to the `filled` set.
2. **Check for object intersection:** The condition for a cell to be fillable is that it must be background and not intersect with any other object.
3. **Fill in one step:** Finally, it fills all the identified cells in the `filled` set with the background color, effectively extending the objects.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and current_color is None:
        current_color = index(O, (i, j))
      elif current_color is not None and index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
      else:
        current_color = None
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate row-wise:**  This version iterates directly through grid rows. 
2. **Track current color:** It uses `current_color` to keep track of the object color being extended in the current row.
3. **Fill background cells:** If a background cell is encountered and a `current_color` is active, it fills that cell with the `current_color`.
4. **Reset at object boundaries:** When a new object or the end of a row is reached, `current_color` is reset to `None`, stopping the extension.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), asobject(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create base canvas:** This version first creates a blank canvas filled with the background color and then paints the input objects onto it.
2. **Extend objects:** The remaining logic is identical to Version 1, extending the objects on this new canvas. 

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, v, {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and fill:** This version simplifies the logic by directly iterating through the grid and for each non-background cell, it fills all subsequent background cells in that row with the current cell's color.


These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, each utilizing different DSL functions and logic flow.
