## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and extending them horizontally to the right until they encounter a different object. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**
- The '1' at (0,0) doesn't change as there are no 0s to its right.
- The '6' at (1, 8) extends to the left edge of the grid.
- The '3's at (3,2) and (4,2) extend to the right edge of the grid, merging with the '1' at (3,8).
- The '6's at (6,7), (7,6), and (8, 5) all extend to the left edge of the grid. 
- The '1' at (9,4) doesn't change.

**Pair 1:**
- The '7's at (0,1) and (8,1) extend to the right until they hit '8'.
- The '8's at (0,6), (1,6), and (2,8) extend to the left edge of the grid.
- The '7' at (2,3) extends to the left until it hits the '8' at (2,8).
- The '3's at (2,5) and (3,5) extend to the right until they hit '8'.
- The '7's at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), and (9,5) all extend to the left and right until they hit an '8'.
- The '8's at (6,8) and (7,3) don't change.
- The '7' at (9,6) doesn't change.

**Pair 2:**
- The '1's at (1,4), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), and (9,1) extend to the right edge of the grid.
- The '3's at (6,4) and (7,4) don't change.
- The '1' at (5,9) doesn't change.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    target_value = color(obj)
    for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(grid)):
      column = {(i, j) for i in range(height(grid))}
      if len(sfilter(toobject(column, grid), lambda x: x[0] != target_value and x[0] != 0)) > 0:
        break
      grid = fill(grid, target_value, column & backdrop(obj))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through objects:** We loop over each object in the grid.
2. **Get target color:** We store the color of the current object.
3. **Extend to the right:** We iterate through each column to the right of the object.
4. **Check for collision:** We check if the column contains any non-target and non-background cells.
5. **Fill if no collision:** If the column is clear or contains only background cells, we fill the column within the object's bounding box with the target color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    start_j = rightmost(obj) + 1
    end_j = next((j for j in range(start_j, width(grid)) 
                  if len(sfilter(toobject({(i, j) for i in range(height(grid))}, grid), 
                                 lambda x: x[0] != color(obj) and x[0] != 0)) > 0), width(grid))
    grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(start_j, end_j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through objects:**  Loop over each object.
2. **Find extension range:** Determine the column range (start_j, end_j) where the object should extend to by finding the first non-target, non-background cell.
3. **Fill the extension:**  Fill the grid with the object's color within the calculated range.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    right_limit = width(grid)
    for other_obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
      if other_obj != obj and hmatching(obj, other_obj) and leftmost(other_obj) > leftmost(obj):
        right_limit = min(right_limit, leftmost(other_obj))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(color(obj), (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                              for j in range(leftmost(obj), right_limit)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create new grid:**  Initialize a new grid with the background color.
2. **Iterate through objects:** Loop over each object in the original grid.
3. **Find rightmost limit:** For each object, find the leftmost position of other objects on the same row that are to the right of the current object.
4. **Paint to the limit:** Paint the new grid with the object's color from its leftmost position to the calculated rightmost limit.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    current_color = None
    current_j = 0
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] != current_color:
        if current_color != 0:
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, current_color, {(i, k) for k in range(current_j, j)})
        current_color = grid[i][j]
        current_j = j
    if current_color != 0:
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, current_color, {(i, k) for k in range(current_j, width(grid))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create new grid:** Initialize a new grid with the background color.
2. **Iterate row-wise:** Loop through each row of the original grid.
3. **Track color changes:** Track the current color and its starting column index while traversing each row.
4. **Fill on color change:** When a new color is encountered or the end of the row is reached, fill the new grid with the previous color from its starting column to the current column.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    j = 0
    while j < width(grid):
      current_color = grid[i][j]
      if current_color != 0:
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(grid) and grid[i][k] == 0:
          grid = fill(grid, current_color, {(i, k)})
          k += 1
        j = k
      else:
        j += 1
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate row-wise:** Loop through each row of the grid.
2. **Find non-background cells:**  For each row, identify non-background cells.
3. **Extend color to the right:** Extend the color of the non-background cell to the right until a non-background cell or the end of the row is encountered.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages different functions and strategies, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
