## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to each input grid extends objects horizontally to the right, up to but not including cells of a different value.  Here's a breakdown for each example:

**Input 0:**

* The '1's are not extended because they are bordered by '0's.
* The '3' objects are extended to the right until they reach a '1'.
* The '6' objects are extended to the right until they reach the edge of the grid.

**Input 1:**

* The '7' objects are extended to the right until they reach a '3' or an '8'.
* The '8' objects are extended to the right until they reach the edge of the grid.
* The '3' objects are not extended because they are bordered by '7's and '8's.

**Input 2:**

* The '1' objects are extended to the right until they reach a '3' or the edge of the grid.
* The '3' objects are not extended because they are bordered by '1's and '0's.

## Program & Explanations:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations for each:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            for k in range(j+1, width(I)):
                if (i, k) not in toindices(obj) and index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
                    I = fill(I, v, {(i, k)})
                else:
                    break
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate through objects and cells:** The code iterates through each object and then each cell within the object.
3. **Extend horizontally:** For every cell, it checks if there are empty cells (`mostcolor(I)`) to the right. If so, it fills them with the object's color (`v`) until it encounters a non-empty cell or the grid edge. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      for j in range(width(I) - 1):
        if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
          I = fill(I, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid cells:** The code iterates through each row and column of the grid.
2. **Check for extension condition:** For each cell, it checks if it's not background color and if the cell to its right is background color.
3. **Extend object:** If the condition is met, it fills the cell to the right with the color of the current cell, effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, False):
    for x in range(1, width(I)):
      I = paint(I, shift(intersection(obj, shift(obj, (0, -x))), (0, x)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, False, False, False)` gets all objects in the grid.
2. **Shift and intersect:** For each object and increasing offset `x`, it shifts the object to the left and finds the intersection with the original object. This identifies portions that can be extended.
3. **Shift back and paint:**  The intersected portion is shifted back to the right by `x` and painted onto the grid, effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I) - 1):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns then rows:** This version iterates through each column and then each cell in that column.
2. **Extend horizontally:** If a cell is not the background color and the cell to its right is, it fills the right cell with the current cell's color.
3. **Use a copy:**  It operates on a copy of the grid (`O`) to avoid extending already extended parts within the same iteration. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for x in range(width(I) - 1):
        I = cellwise(I, shift(I, (0, 1)), mostcolor(I))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through shifted grids:**  The program iterates through shifted versions of the input grid.
2. **Cellwise comparison and fill:** It compares the current grid with the shifted grid using `cellwise`. If a cell in the current grid is not the background color and the corresponding cell in the shifted grid is, it fills that cell in the current grid with its own color, effectively extending the object.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same goal, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Remember to thoroughly test any code generated using this approach to ensure it achieves the desired results across all potential input grids.
