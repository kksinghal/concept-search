## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves identifying the object composed of '1's and extending it horizontally to the right, filling the space until it reaches the rightmost '1' cell in the input grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The transformation identifies the objects composed of '7's and '8's and extends them horizontally to the right. The extension continues until it reaches the rightmost cell of the same value within the object's row in the input grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The transformation identifies the object composed of '1's and extends it vertically downwards, filling the space until it reaches the bottommost '1' cell in the input grid. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in obj:
      i, (row, col) = cell
      for j in range(col + 1, width(grid)):
        if (row, j) in toindices(obj):
          break
        if grid[row][j] == bg:
          grid = fill(grid, i, {(row, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  The code first identifies all objects in the grid using `objects(grid, True, False, True)`.
2. **Iterate and extend:** It iterates through each object and its cells. For every cell, it checks cells to its right.
3. **Extend or stop:** If a cell to the right is background (`bg`) and doesn't reach the rightmost cell of the same value within the object's row, it fills the cell with the object's color using `fill(grid, i, {(row, j)})`. If it encounters another cell of the same object or a non-background cell, it stops extending.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcolor(grid):
        for k in range(j + 1, width(grid)):
          if grid[i][k] == val:
            grid = fill(grid, val, connect((i,j), (i,k)))
            break
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for object color:** If a cell doesn't have the background color, it searches for the next occurrence of the same color in that row.
3. **Connect and fill:** If found, it uses `connect` to create a line of indices between the two cells and fills it with the object color using `fill`.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
      row = uppermost(obj)
      left, right = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
      grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(row, j) for j in range(left, right + 1)})
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** This version identifies objects like the previous ones.
2. **Determine object boundaries:** For each object, it finds the top row (`uppermost`), leftmost column (`leftmost`), and rightmost column (`rightmost`).
3. **Fill horizontally:** It then fills the entire horizontal space occupied by the object within its bounding row using `fill`.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  transposed = dmirror(grid)
  transposed = solve_version_1(transposed)
  return dmirror(transposed)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose grid:** This version leverages an existing solution (`solve_version_1`) which potentially solves the vertical extension. It first transposes the grid using `dmirror` to turn the problem into a vertical extension task.
2. **Apply existing solution:** It applies `solve_version_1` on the transposed grid.
3. **Transpose back:** Finally, it transposes the result back to the original orientation using `dmirror`.

**Note:** This version assumes the existence of a working solution (`solve_version_1`) that handles vertical extension. 

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  for j in range(width(grid)):
    for i in range(h):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid):
        for k in range(i + 1, h):
          if grid[k][j] == grid[i][j]:
            grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j], connect((i,j), (k,j)))
            break
        break
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate column-wise:**  This version focuses on vertical extension by iterating through each column first and then the rows. 
2. **Check for object color:** Similar to version 2, it checks for a non-background color and searches for the next occurrence of the same color in that column.
3. **Connect and fill:**  If found, it connects the two cells vertically using `connect` and fills the connection with the object color using `fill`.

Each version leverages different strategies and DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation. While some versions utilize object detection, others perform cell-wise operations. Version 4 cleverly utilizes code reuse by adapting an existing solution for a slightly different scenario.
