## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending lines of digits horizontally to the right, until they encounter a different non-zero digit. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '3's on row 4 extend right to become '1 1 1 1 1', and the '6's on rows 7, 8, and 9 extend to meet the existing '6' on the right.
* **Input_1:**  The '7' on row 3 extends right to meet the '3', and the '8's on the same row extend to the right edge. Similar extensions happen with the '7's in the bottom rows and the '8's in the rightmost columns.
* **Input_2:** The most noticeable change is the line of '1's from top to bottom, extending rightward until they hit the rightmost '1'. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I  # Initialize the output grid
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False): # Iterate over each object
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj) # Find the leftmost column of the object
    for i, j in toindices(obj): # Iterate over cells in the object
      O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))}) # Paint current cell to output
      for k in range(leftmost_j + 1, len(I[0])): # Iterate over cells to the right
        if index(I, (i, k)) == 0: # Check if the cell is empty
          O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, k))}) # Fill the cell with the object color
        else:
          break # Stop extending if a non-zero cell is encountered
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Starts with the output grid `O` identical to the input `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the input using `objects(I, True, False, False)`, considering objects formed by connected cells of the same value, ignoring diagonals and background.
3. **Horizontal Extension:**  For each object, it finds its leftmost column (`leftmost_j`). Then, it iterates through the cells to the right, filling them with the object's color (`color(obj)`) if they are empty (`index(I, (i, k)) == 0`). The extension stops when a non-zero cell is encountered.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != 0:
                k = j + 1
                while k < len(I[0]) and I[i][k] == 0:
                    O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k)})
                    k += 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Starts with the output grid `O` identical to the input `I`.
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid `I`.
3. **Line Extension:** If a cell is not empty (`I[i][j] != 0`), it starts extending a line to the right. 
4. **Filling Empty Cells:**  The line extends by filling empty cells (`I[i][k] == 0`) with the value of the starting cell (`I[i][j]`).
5. **Encountering Non-Zero:** The extension halts when it encounters a non-zero cell (`I[i][k] != 0`).

**Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
        O = paint(O, obj)
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])):
                if index(I, (i, k)) == 0:
                    O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, k))})
                else:
                    break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:**  Begins by creating an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input grid `I` using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
2. **Object Painting:** It iterates through each object in the input grid `I`, identified using `objects(I, True, False, False)`. For each object, it directly paints the object onto the canvas `O`.
3. **Extension from Objects:** For every cell within each object, it tries to extend a line to the right.
4. **Conditional Filling:** The line extends by filling empty cells with the object's color, stopping at the first non-zero cell encountered.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        current_color = 0
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != 0:
                current_color = I[i][j]
            elif current_color != 0:
                O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **In-Place Modification:**  Operates directly on a copy of the input grid `O`, modifying it to produce the output.
2. **Row-wise Tracking:** Iterates through the grid row by row. `current_color` variable keeps track of the non-zero color encountered in the current row. 
3. **Color Extension:** If a zero is encountered (`I[i][j] == 0`) and a `current_color` is active, the cell is filled with the `current_color`. 
4. **Color Reset:** When a new non-zero value is encountered, the `current_color` is updated.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      j = leftmost(obj)
      while j < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j)) != other(palette(obj), 0):
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})
        j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Grid Modification:** Works directly on a copy of the input grid `O`.
2. **Object-Based Iteration:** Iterates through objects in the input using `objects(I, True, False, False)`.
3. **Row-Wise Extension:** For each row within an object's bounding box (`uppermost(obj)` to `lowermost(obj)`), it starts from the object's leftmost column (`leftmost(obj)`) and extends rightward.
4. **Boundary Detection:**  The extension continues as long as it encounters either empty cells (`index(I, (i, j)) == 0`) or cells containing the object's color. It utilizes `other(palette(obj), 0)` to cleverly identify the object's color while considering the possibility of the background also being 0.
5. **Line Termination:**  The extension stops when it encounters a cell containing a different non-zero value.
