## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending objects horizontally towards the right, but only if the object's color matches the color of a cell directly above it in the same column. The extension stops upon encountering a non-background cell.

**Input 0:** 
- The '1' at (0,0) doesn't extend because there's no cell above it.
- The '6' at (1,8) doesn't extend because the cell above is background (0).
- The '1' at (4,8) extends rightwards to the edge, filling with '1' because the cells above are also '1'.
- The '3's at (3,2) and (4,2) extend rightwards until encountering the '1' at (3,8).
- The '6's at (6,7), (7,6), (8,5) extend rightwards until encountering the original object boundary.

**Input 1:**
- The logic applies similarly to Input 0. Noteworthy cases:
  - The '8' at (2,9) extends rightwards because the cells above are '8'. 
  - The '7' at (9,6) remains unchanged because the cell above is '0'.

**Input 2:**
-  The logic applies similarly to previous inputs. The '1's at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) and (5,1) extend rightwards because the cells above are also '1'. 

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i - 1, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i - 1, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(O))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Starts with output `O` as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through rows (from the second row) and columns.
3. **Condition:** Checks if a cell is background, the cell above is not background, and the cell to the right is background.
4. **Filling:** If the condition holds, it fills the background cells to the right with the color of the cell above.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj) + 1):
      j = leftmost(obj)
      while j < width(I) and index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i - 1, j)), {(i, j)})
        j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Starts with output `O` as the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the grid (excluding background).
3. **Row Iteration:** For each row within the object's bounding box (excluding the top row):
4. **Horizontal Filling:**  Starts from the object's leftmost column and fills background cells with the color of the cell above, moving rightwards until encountering a non-background cell.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(1, height(I)):
      if index(O, (i - 1, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i - 1, j)), {(i, j)})
        i += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Starts with output `O` as the input grid `I`.
2. **Column Iteration:** Iterates through columns.
3. **Vertical Filling:**  For each column, it iterates through rows (from the second row) and fills background cells with the color of the cell above as long as the condition continues to hold.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    current_color = None
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
      if current_color is not None:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates an output grid `O` filled with the background color, having the same shape as the input.
2. **Column-wise Painting:**  Iterates through columns, maintaining a `current_color`.
3. **Color Tracking:** If a non-background cell is encountered, it updates `current_color`.
4. **Painting:** Paints the current cell with `current_color` if it's not None.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i - 1, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        k = j
        while k < width(I) and index(O, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, index(O, (i - 1, j)), {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Starts with output `O` as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through rows (from the second row) and columns.
3. **Horizontal Extension:**  If a background cell is found below a non-background cell, it triggers a horizontal extension.
4. **Filling:** It extends rightwards, filling background cells with the color of the cell above until encountering a non-background cell.
