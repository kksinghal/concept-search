## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of the same color and extending one of them horizontally or vertically to connect with the nearest object of the same color.

**Input_0:** The '1' object extends right to connect with the other '1'. The '6' objects extend upwards to connect with the other '6' objects.

**Input_1:** The '8' objects extend downwards to connect with other '8's. The '7' objects extend right to connect with other '7's.

**Input_2:** The '1' objects extend upwards to connect with other '1's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    color_val = color(obj)
    same_color_objs = colorfilter(objs, color_val) - {obj}
    if same_color_objs:
      closest_obj = argmin(same_color_objs, lambda x: manhattan(obj, x))
      direction = gravitate(obj, closest_obj)
      while not adjacent(obj, closest_obj):
        obj = shift(obj, direction)
        I = paint(cover(I, obj), obj)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, False, False, True)` finds all objects (connected components) in the grid excluding the background.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The program iterates through each identified object (`obj`).
3. **Find closest object of the same color:** 
    - `color(obj)` retrieves the color of the current object.
    - `colorfilter(objs, color_val)` filters objects with the same color.
    - `argmin(same_color_objs, lambda x: manhattan(obj, x))` finds the closest object of the same color based on Manhattan distance.
4. **Determine direction and extend:**
    - `gravitate(obj, closest_obj)` calculates the direction to move the object to connect with the closest one.
    - The `while` loop shifts the object one step at a time in the determined direction until it's adjacent to the closest object, painting over the grid in each iteration.
5. **Return the transformed grid:** The final transformed grid `I` is returned as `O`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:
    objs = colorfilter(objects(I, False, False, True), v)
    if len(objs) > 1:
      obj1 = first(objs)
      rest_objs = objs - {obj1}
      closest_obj = argmin(rest_objs, lambda x: manhattan(obj1, x))
      I = paint(
        I,
        recolor(
          v,
          connect(centerofmass(obj1), centerofmass(closest_obj))
        )
      )
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:** This version iterates through each color (`v`) present in the grid except the background color.
2. **Find objects of the current color:**
   - `objects(I, False, False, True)` finds all objects.
   - `colorfilter(objs, v)` filters objects of the current color.
3. **Connect closest objects:**
   - If there are multiple objects of the same color:
     - `first(objs)` selects one object.
     - `argmin` finds the closest object to the first one.
     - `connect(centerofmass(obj1), centerofmass(closest_obj))` creates a line connecting their centers of mass.
     - `recolor(v, ...)` assigns the current color to the line.
     - `paint(I, ...)` paints the line on the grid.
4. **Return the transformed grid:** The final grid `I` with the connected objects is returned as `O`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    c = color(obj)
    other_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, False, False, True), c) - {obj}
    if other_objs:
      closest = argmin(other_objs, lambda x: manhattan(obj, x))
      if hmatching(obj, closest):
        direction = (sign(uppermost(closest) - uppermost(obj)), 0)
      else:
        direction = (0, sign(leftmost(closest) - leftmost(obj)))
      while not adjacent(obj, closest):
        obj = shift(obj, direction)
        I = paint(cover(I, obj), obj)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Similar to Version 1, the program iterates through each object.
2. **Find closest object of the same color:** Same logic as Version 1.
3. **Determine direction based on alignment:**
   - `hmatching(obj, closest)` checks if objects share a row.
   - If they do, the direction is vertical (0, ±1) based on the relative vertical position.
   - Otherwise, the direction is horizontal (±1, 0) based on the relative horizontal position.
4. **Extend object:**  Same logic as Version 1, the object extends in the determined direction until adjacent to the closest object.
5. **Return the transformed grid:** The modified grid `I` is returned as `O`.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:
    objs = colorfilter(objects(I, False, False, True), v)
    while size(objs) > 1:
      obj1 = first(objs)
      objs = objs - {obj1}
      closest_obj = argmin(objs, lambda x: manhattan(obj1, x))
      conn = connect(centerofmass(obj1), centerofmass(closest_obj))
      I = paint(I, recolor(v, conn))
      objs = colorfilter(objects(I, False, False, True), v)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 2 but uses a `while` loop to iteratively connect objects of the same color until only one connected component remains for each color.

1. **Iterate through colors:** Same as Version 2.
2. **Connect objects of the same color:**
   - The `while` loop continues as long as there are multiple objects of the current color.
   - It selects one object (`obj1`) and finds the closest object.
   - A line connecting their centers of mass is drawn and painted with the current color.
   - Objects are re-identified after each connection to account for merging.
3. **Return the transformed grid:** The final grid `I` is returned as `O`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for i in range(size(objs)):
    for obj1 in objs:
      c = color(obj1)
      other_objs = colorfilter(objs, c) - {obj1}
      if other_objs:
        closest_obj = argmin(other_objs, lambda x: manhattan(obj1, x))
        if manhattan(obj1, closest_obj) == 2:
          I = paint(I, recolor(c, connect(centerofmass(obj1), centerofmass(closest_obj))))
          break
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate through objects multiple times:**  The outer `for` loop iterates a fixed number of times (equal to the initial number of objects).
3. **Connect objects at distance 2:**
   - For each object, it finds the closest object of the same color.
   - If the Manhattan distance between them is exactly 2, it connects their centers of mass with a line of the same color.
   - It breaks the inner loop after each connection and re-identifies objects.
4. **Return the transformed grid:** The modified grid `I` is returned as `O`.

These are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL functions, each with a different approach to achieve the desired transformation.
