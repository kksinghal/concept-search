## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to extend objects horizontally towards other objects of the same color, stopping just before touching them. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The '1' objects remain unchanged as they are isolated.
* The '3' objects extend rightward, filling the space until the rightmost '1'.
* The '6' objects extend both leftward and rightward, filling the space until encountering other '6' objects.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The '7' objects at the top and bottom extend rightward until encountering the '8' object.
* The central '7' object extends both leftward and rightward until encountering other '7' or '8' objects.
* The '8' objects extend rightward until encountering other '8' objects.
* The '3' objects remain unchanged as they are enclosed by '8' objects.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* The '1' objects extend upwards and downwards to meet other '1' objects, effectively forming a continuous vertical line.
* The '3' objects remain unchanged as they are isolated.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for dj in range(1, width(I)):
        if j + dj < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + dj)) == bg:
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j + dj)})
        else:
          break
      for dj in range(1, width(I)):
        if j - dj >= 0 and index(I, (i, j - dj)) == bg:
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j - dj)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** 
    * Identifies objects in the input grid ('I') using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
    * Determines the background color using `mostcolor(I)`.
    * Creates a copy of the input grid as the output grid ('O').
2. **Iteration:**
    * Iterates through each object ('obj') in the identified objects.
    * For each cell ('i', 'j') within the object:
        * Extends the object horizontally to the right by iterating through increasing column indices ('j + dj').
        * Uses `index(I, (i, j + dj)) == bg` to check if the current cell is the background color.
        * If it's background, fills that cell with the object's color using `fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j + dj)})`.
        * Stops extending when encountering a non-background color.
        * Repeats the same extension process horizontally to the left (decreasing column indices 'j - dj').
3. **Output:**
    * Returns the modified output grid 'O'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    O = hstretch(O, i)
  for i in range(height(I)-1, -1, -1):
    O = hstretch(O, i)
  return O

def hstretch(grid, i):
  row = grid[i]
  for j in range(len(row)-1):
    if row[j] != mostcommon(grid) and row[j+1] == mostcommon(grid):
      grid = fill(grid, row[j], {(i, j+1)})
  for j in range(len(row)-1,0,-1):
    if row[j] != mostcommon(grid) and row[j-1] == mostcommon(grid):
      grid = fill(grid, row[j], {(i, j-1)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** 
    * Creates a copy of the input grid as the output grid ('O').
2. **Horizontal Stretching:**
    * Iterates through each row index ('i') of the grid.
    * Applies the `hstretch` function to each row.
3. **`hstretch` function:**
    * Takes the grid and the row index as input.
    * Iterates through the row from left to right and right to left, filling background cells with the color of the nearest non-background cell. 
4. **Output:**
    * Returns the modified output grid 'O'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    for i in range(ul[0], lr[0]+1):
      O = hstretch_segment(O, i, ul[1], lr[1])
  return O

def hstretch_segment(grid, i, start_j, end_j):
  bg = mostcommon(grid)
  for j in range(start_j, end_j):
    if grid[i][j] != bg and grid[i][j+1] == bg:
      grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j], {(i, j+1)})
  for j in range(end_j, start_j, -1):
    if grid[i][j] != bg and grid[i][j-1] == bg:
      grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j], {(i, j-1)})
  return grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** 
    * Creates a copy of the input grid as the output grid ('O').
2. **Object-based Stretching:**
    * Iterates through each object ('obj') in the identified objects.
    * Finds the upper-left ('ul') and lower-right ('lr') corners of the object.
3. **`hstretch_segment` function:**
    * Takes the grid, row index ('i'), and starting and ending column indices ('start_j', 'end_j') as input.
    * Stretches the object horizontally within the specified row segment.
4. **Output:**
    * Returns the modified output grid 'O'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = I[i]
    for j in range(len(row)-1):
      if row[j] != row[j+1] and row[j+1] == mostcommon(I):
        O = fill(O, row[j], {(i, k) for k in range(j+1, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcommon(I)})
    for j in range(len(row)-1, 0, -1):
      if row[j] != row[j-1] and row[j-1] == mostcommon(I):
        O = fill(O, row[j], {(i, k) for k in range(j-1, -1, -1) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcommon(I)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** 
    * Creates a copy of the input grid as the output grid ('O').
2. **Row-wise Stretching:**
    * Iterates through each row ('i') of the grid.
3. **Filling:**
    * For each cell in the row, if it's different from its right neighbor and the right neighbor is the background color, it fills all consecutive background cells to the right with the current cell's color.
    * Repeats the process for the left side.
4. **Output:**
    * Returns the modified output grid 'O'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    O = paint(O, hstretch_object(I, obj))
  return O

def hstretch_object(grid, obj):
  new_obj = set(obj)
  for v, (i, j) in obj:
    for dj in range(1, width(grid)):
      if j + dj < width(grid) and index(grid, (i, j + dj)) == mostcommon(grid):
        new_obj.add((v, (i, j+dj)))
      else:
        break
    for dj in range(1, width(grid)):
      if j - dj >= 0 and index(grid, (i, j - dj)) == mostcommon(grid):
        new_obj.add((v, (i, j-dj)))
      else:
        break
  return frozenset(new_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** 
    * Creates a copy of the input grid as the output grid ('O').
2. **Object-based Stretching and Painting:**
    * Iterates through each object ('obj') in the input grid.
    * Applies the `hstretch_object` function to each object.
    * Paints the stretched object onto the output grid.
3. **`hstretch_object` function:**
    * Takes the input grid and the current object as input.
    * Creates a new object set ('new_obj').
    * For each cell in the object, it expands horizontally in both directions, adding the background cells to the 'new_obj'.
    * Returns the stretched object ('new_obj').
4. **Output:**
    * Returns the modified output grid ('O').


Each of these versions utilizes different approaches and DSL functions to achieve the same horizontal stretching transformation observed in the input-output examples. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in tackling spatial reasoning tasks.
