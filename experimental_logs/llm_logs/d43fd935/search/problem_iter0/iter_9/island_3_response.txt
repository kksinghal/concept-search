## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally towards the right until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. The extension uses the color of the leftmost cell of the object. 

**Input_0:** 
* The '1' object at (3,8) extends right to become {(3,8), (3,9)}.
* The '1' object at (9,4) extends right to become {(9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)}.
* The '3' object at (3,2) extends right to become {(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)}.
* The '6' objects at (6,2), (7,6), (8,2) extend right to reach the edge of the grid.

**Input_1:**
* The '7' object at (2,3) extends right to become {(2,3), (2,4)}.
* The '8' objects at (2,6), (2,9) extend right to reach the edge of the grid.
* The '7' object at (9,5) extends right to reach the edge of the grid.

**Input_2:**
* The '1' objects at (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (9,0) extend right to reach the edge of the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    obj_color = color(obj)
    for j in range(rightmost_j + 1, width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (uppermost(obj), j)) == mostcolor(grid):
        obj = insert((obj_color, (uppermost(obj), j)), obj)
      else:
        break
    new_objs.add(obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Find all objects on the grid excluding the background using `objects(grid, True, False, True)`.
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  For each object:
   - Determine its leftmost and rightmost column indices (`leftmost`, `rightmost`).
   - Get the object's color (`color`).
   - Iterate from the column right of the rightmost column to the grid's edge.
   - If the current cell is background (`mostcolor`), fill it with the object's color and add the new cell to the object.
   - Stop extending if a non-background color is encountered.
3. **Paint to Grid:** Create a blank canvas (`canvas`) and paint the extended objects onto it (`paint`, `merge`).

### Program Version 2:

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), frozenset((i, j) for i, j in product(range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1), range(leftmost(obj), width(grid))) if index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcolor(grid) or (i, j) in toindices(obj))), objects(grid, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Find all objects on the grid excluding the background using `objects(grid, True, False, True)`.
2. **Extend Objects:**  For each object:
   - Get the object's color (`color`).
   - Create a new object using `recolor` that includes all cells from the object's bounding box that are either background or part of the original object. This effectively extends the object rightward.
3. **Paint to Grid:** Paint the extended objects onto the original grid (`paint`, `merge`).

### Program Version 3:

```python
def program_v3(grid):
    out_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
    for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
            for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(grid)):
                if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):
                    out_grid = fill(out_grid, index(grid, (i, j)), {(i, j)})
                    break
                out_grid = fill(out_grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})
    return out_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** Create a canvas filled with the background color (`canvas`, `mostcolor`, `shape`).
2. **Iterate and Fill:** For each object:
   - Iterate through each row within the object's bounding box.
   - For each cell in the row, starting from the leftmost column:
     - If the cell is not background in the original grid, fill the corresponding cell in the output grid with the same color and move to the next row.
     - Otherwise, fill the cell in the output grid with the object's color.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def program_v4(grid):
    out_grid = grid
    for i in range(height(grid)):
        j = 0
        while j < width(grid):
            if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):
                current_color = index(grid, (i, j))
                k = j + 1
                while k < width(grid) and index(grid, (i, k)) == mostcolor(grid):
                    out_grid = fill(out_grid, current_color, {(i, k)})
                    k += 1
                j = k
            else:
                j += 1
    return out_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Row-wise:**  Iterate through each row of the grid.
2. **Extend Objects:** For each row:
   - Iterate through each column.
   - If a non-background color is encountered, store the color and extend it rightward until another non-background color or the edge is reached.
   - Update the loop index (`j`) to skip over the extended region in the next iteration.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(lambda obj: toobject(product(range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1), range(leftmost(obj), next((j for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(grid)) if index(grid, (uppermost(obj), j)) != mostcolor(grid)), width(grid)))), grid), objects(grid, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects excluding the background (`objects`).
2. **Determine Extension:** For each object:
    - Find the rightmost column to extend to. This is done by finding the first non-background color in the object's row starting from the object's leftmost column.
    - Create a new object (`toobject`) that includes all cells within the object's bounding box up to the determined column. 
3. **Paint to Grid:** Paint the extended objects onto a blank canvas (`paint`, `canvas`, `merge`).


These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity possible within the DSL.
