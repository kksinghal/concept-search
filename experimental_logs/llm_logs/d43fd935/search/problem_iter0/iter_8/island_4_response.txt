## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves connecting objects of the same color horizontally. However, there are some key nuances:

* **No diagonal connections:** Only directly adjacent cells of the same color are connected.
* **Directional preference:** The connection process prioritizes connecting objects to the right. If an object cannot be extended to the right, it remains unchanged.
* **Background remains:** The most frequent color in the input grid is considered the background and is not affected by the transformation.

**Input 0:**

* The '1' objects remain unchanged as there are no '1's to their right.
* The '3' object extends rightwards to connect with the adjacent '1'.
* The '6' objects remain unchanged as there are no '6's to their right.

**Input 1:**

* The top-most '7' object remains unchanged.
* The bottom-most '7' object extends rightwards to connect with the other two '7's.
* The '3' object remains unchanged.
* The '8' objects remain unchanged.

**Input 2:**

* All '1' objects remain unchanged.
* The '3' object remains unchanged. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def connect_horizontally(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(O)):
    for j in range(width(O) - 1):
      if index(O, (i, j)) == index(O, (i, j + 1)) and index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), {(i, j), (i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Check for same-color neighbors:** For each cell, it checks if the cell to its right has the same color and is not the background color.
3. **Connect if true:** If both conditions are met, it fills both cells with the shared color.

**Version 2:**

```python
def connect_horizontally(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued = True, diagonal = False, without_bg = True)
  for obj in objs:
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      if (v, (i, j + 1)) in obj:
        I = fill(I, v, connect((i, j), (i, j + 1)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  It first identifies all non-background objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate through objects:**  For each object, it checks for horizontally adjacent cells belonging to the same object.
3. **Connect:** If adjacent cells are found, it connects them by filling the line between them with the object's color. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def connect_horizontally(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(O)):
    current_color = None
    start_j = None
    for j in range(width(O)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and (current_color is None or current_color != index(O, (i, j))):
        current_color = index(O, (i, j))
        start_j = j
      elif current_color is not None and index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, k) for k in range(start_j, j)})
        current_color = None
    if current_color is not None:
      O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, k) for k in range(start_j, width(O))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Track color and start:** Iterates through each row, tracking the current color being connected and its starting column.
2. **Fill until background:** When encountering the background color, it fills all cells from the starting column with the current color. 
3. **Handle end of row:**  Fills the remaining cells of the row if the color extends to the edge.

**Version 4:**

```python
def connect_horizontally(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    max_j = rightmost(obj)
    i = uppermost(obj)
    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Creates a new grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through objects:**  Identifies non-background objects in the input grid.
3. **Draw connected lines:** For each object, it determines the leftmost and rightmost columns and fills a horizontal line on the canvas with the object's color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def connect_horizontally(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(O)):
    for j in range(width(O) - 1):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        next_j = j + 1
        while next_j < width(O) and index(O, (i, next_j)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), {(i, next_j)})
          next_j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and extend:** Iterates through each cell, and if it's not the background color, it extends the color rightwards until it encounters a non-background color. 
2. **Fill during extension:** The extension process fills each encountered background cell with the extending color. 

These five versions utilize various strategies and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the desired transformation, demonstrating diverse solutions within the constraints of the provided DSL.
