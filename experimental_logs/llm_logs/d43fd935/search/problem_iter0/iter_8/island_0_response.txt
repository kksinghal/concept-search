## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to connect separate occurrences of the same digit within each row, effectively extending them horizontally until they hit another digit or the grid's edge. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '1's in the top and bottom rows extend to fill their respective rows.
* The '6's in the 2nd and 7th-9th rows extend to fill their respective rows.
* The '3's in the 4th and 5th rows extend to connect, forming a single horizontal line of '3's. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '7's in the 1st, 3rd, and 9th-10th rows extend to connect horizontally.
* The '8's in the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 8th rows extend to connect horizontally.
* The '3's in the 4th row connect horizontally.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* A vertical line of '1's is formed by connecting the individual '1's across rows 2-6.

## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = index(O, (i, j))
        # Extend right
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and index(O, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each cell in each row of the grid.
2. **Identify Non-Background Cells:** If a cell doesn't contain the background color (most common color), it's considered part of an object.
3. **Extend Right:** The code extends the object's color to the right until it encounters a non-background color or the grid's edge.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for row in range(height(I)):
    objs = objects(crop(I, (row, 0), (1, width(I))), True, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(row, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows and Objects:** This version iterates through each row, identifying objects within that row using the `objects` function.
2. **Fill Entire Object Span:** It then fills the entire horizontal span of each object with its color, effectively connecting separate occurrences.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        start = j
        while j < width(I) and index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
          j += 1
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, start)), {(i, k) for k in range(start, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Empty Canvas:** This version starts with an empty canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Find and Fill Objects:** It iterates through each row, finding contiguous segments of non-background colors and filling them in the canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    line = crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I)))
    for j in range(width(line)):
      if index(line, (0, j)) != mostcolor(line):
        O = fill(O, index(line, (0, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(line))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** The code iterates through each row.
2. **Find First Non-Background Cell:** It finds the first non-background cell in the row.
3. **Fill from that Cell:**  It fills the row with that cell's color from that cell's position to the end of the row.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
        color_to_extend = index(O, (i, j))
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and index(O, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, color_to_extend, {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Extend:** This version specifically looks for a non-background color followed by a background color.
2. **Extend Color:** It then extends the non-background color to the right until hitting a different color or the edge. 

These five program versions showcase diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation within the DSL constraints, highlighting the flexibility and problem-solving capabilities required for this task.
