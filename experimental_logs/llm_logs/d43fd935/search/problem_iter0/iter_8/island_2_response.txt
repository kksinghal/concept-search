## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be summarized as follows:

* **Extend specific colored objects:**  Certain colored objects in the input grid are extended either horizontally or vertically until they reach a border.
* **Maintain object shape:** The extension process preserves the original shape of the object. 
* **Background color:** The background color of the grid remains unchanged.

Here's a detailed breakdown for each color:

* **Color 1:** Objects are extended downwards.
* **Color 3:** Objects are extended rightwards.
* **Color 7:** Objects are extended rightwards.
* **Color 8:** Objects are extended downwards.
* **Other Colors:** Objects with colors other than 1, 3, 7, and 8 remain unchanged.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code that implement the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def faegdfhahddiebbajbbjaaffdgjijacf(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Initialize with background
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    c = mostcolor(obj)
    if c == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, backdrop(shift(obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj), 0)))))  # Extend down
    elif c in (3, 7):
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, backdrop(shift(obj, (0, width(I) - leftmost(obj)), 0))))  # Extend right
    elif c == 8:
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, backdrop(shift(obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj), 0)))))  # Extend down
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Keep other colors unchanged
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid `O` filled with the background color of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid `I`.
3. **Identify Color:**  Determine the most common color `c` of the current object.
4. **Extend Based on Color:**
   * If `c` is 1 or 8, extend the object downwards by shifting it and then calculating the backdrop of the shifted object.
   * If `c` is 3 or 7, extend the object rightwards using a similar shifting and backdrop calculation.
   * If `c` is not any of the above, paint the object directly onto the output grid without any modification.
5. **Return Output:** After processing all objects, return the transformed output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def dcabeahcjaccecchbabdbeibfgfaeddb(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Initialize with background
  for c in (1, 3, 7, 8):  # Iterate over specific colors
    for obj in objects(I, True, True, True):
      if color(obj) == c:
        if c in (1, 8):
          O = paint(O, recolor(c, connect(ulcorner(obj), (height(I) - 1, ulcorner(obj)[1]))))  # Extend down
        elif c in (3, 7):
          O = paint(O, recolor(c, connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], width(I) - 1))))  # Extend right
        break  # Move to the next color after processing one object of the current color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, initialize output grid `O` with the background color.
2. **Iterate Colors:** Loop through specific colors (1, 3, 7, 8).
3. **Find Object:** For each color, find the first object in the input grid that matches that color.
4. **Extend Object:**
   * If the color is 1 or 8, connect the upper-left corner of the object to the bottom row of the grid at the same column index.
   * If the color is 3 or 7, connect the upper-left corner to the rightmost column at the same row index.
5. **Continue to Next Color:** After processing one object of the current color, move on to the next color in the loop.
6. **Return Output:** Finally, return the modified output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def fbfaaigddffcejagahgcbdihbeajgdah(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Initialize with background
    for obj in objects(I, True, True, True):
        c = color(obj)
        if c in (1, 3, 7, 8):
            start_point = ulcorner(obj)
            end_point = (start_point[0] + (height(I) - 1) * (c in (1, 8)), 
                         start_point[1] + (width(I) - 1) * (c in (3, 7)))
            O = paint(O, recolor(c, connect(start_point, end_point)))  # Extend based on color
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)  # Keep other colors unchanged
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the output grid `O` with the background color, similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
3. **Check Color:** Determine the object's color `c`.
4. **Calculate End Point:** Based on the color:
   * If `c` is 1 or 8, set the end point to the bottom row of the grid at the same column as the object's upper-left corner.
   * If `c` is 3 or 7, set the end point to the rightmost column at the same row as the object's upper-left corner.
5. **Extend Object:** Connect the object's upper-left corner (`start_point`) to the calculated `end_point` and paint this connected line onto the output grid.
6. **Handle Other Colors:** For colors other than 1, 3, 7, and 8, paint the object directly onto the output grid without any modification.
7. **Return Output:** Return the transformed output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def gdhjijhcgbcegccgbeafffbgbhhaadj(I):
  O = I  # Start with input grid
  for c in (1, 8):
    for obj in objects(I, True, True, True):
      if color(obj) == c:
        O = underfill(O, c,  {(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I))})  # Extend down
  for c in (3, 7):
    for obj in objects(I, True, True, True):
      if color(obj) == c:
        O = underfill(O, c, {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I))})  # Extend right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Unlike previous versions, initialize the output grid `O` directly with the input grid `I`.
2. **Extend Downwards:** Loop through colors 1 and 8. For each object with a matching color, extend downwards using `underfill` from the object's uppermost row to the bottom of the grid.
3. **Extend Rightwards:** Loop through colors 3 and 7. For each matching object, extend rightwards using `underfill` from the object's leftmost column to the right edge of the grid.
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def eddaabffccgggajhhddabbfhcgjhfehc(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
        c = mostcolor(obj)
        if c == 1:
            O = paint(O, recolor(c, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}))
        elif c == 3 or c == 7:
            O = paint(O, recolor(c, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I))}))
        elif c == 8:
            O = paint(O, recolor(c, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}))
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Create an output grid `O` filled with the background color of the input grid.
2. **Iterate Objects:**  Loop through each object in the input grid.
3. **Color-Specific Actions:**
   * If the object's most common color (`c`) is 1 or 8, extend the object downwards by creating a new object that spans from the object's uppermost row to the bottom of the grid, maintaining the object's original width.
   * If `c` is 3 or 7, extend the object to the right by creating a new object that spans from the object's leftmost column to the right edge of the grid, maintaining the object's original height.
   * If `c` doesn't match any of the above, paint the object onto the output grid without modification.
4. **Return Output:**  Return the modified output grid.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same grid transformation. Each version leverages different DSL functions and logic to extend specific colored objects while preserving other objects and the background.
