## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each object in the grid:**

1. **Identify the object's bounding box:** Determine the uppermost, lowermost, leftmost, and rightmost points of the object.
2. **Extend the object horizontally:** Starting from the leftmost point of each row within the bounding box, extend the object to the right until it encounters a non-background cell or reaches the bounding box's rightmost point.

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' objects are extended rightwards until they hit the '6' object or the edge of the grid. The '3' object is extended rightwards until it hits the '1' object.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, objects are extended rightwards until they hit another object or the grid edge.
* **Input_2:** The '1' objects are extended rightwards until they hit the '3' object or the grid edge.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background
  bg = mostcolor(grid)  # Determine background color
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(grid)) # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # Iterate through rows within the object's bounding box
      for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(grid)): # Iterate from the object's leftmost point to the right edge of the grid
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj) or index(new_grid, (i, j)) != bg: # Check if the cell is already part of the object or not a background cell
          break
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, j)}) # Fill the cell with the object's color
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object, identifies its bounding box, and extends it rightwards. It utilizes the `objects` function to extract objects, `toindices` to check cell membership, and `fill` to modify the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  O = grid
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid) - 1):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid) and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(grid):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), connect((i, j), (i, width(grid) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the process by directly iterating through the grid and identifying object edges based on color differences between adjacent cells. It then extends the object using the `connect` function to draw a line from the edge to the grid's right boundary.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for x, y in asindices(I):
    if index(O, (x, y)) != mostcolor(I):
      O = fill(O, index(O, (x, y)), {(x, k) for k in range(y, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version further simplifies the logic by iterating through all grid cells and immediately extending objects rightwards from any non-background cell using a list comprehension within the `fill` function.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(color(obj), (i, j)) for i, j in toindices(obj)})
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost_j, width(grid)):
        if index(new_grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):
          break
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version first paints all objects onto a blank canvas. Then, it iterates through each object and extends it rightwards, ensuring that existing objects are not overwritten.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    out_grid = grid
    for y in range(height(grid)):
        x = 0
        while x < width(grid) and index(out_grid, (y, x)) == mostcolor(grid):
            x += 1
        if x < width(grid):
            target_color = index(out_grid, (y, x))
            while x < width(grid):
                if index(out_grid, (y, x)) == mostcolor(grid):
                    out_grid = fill(out_grid, target_color, {(y, x)})
                x += 1
    return out_grid

```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row of the grid, identifying the first non-background cell. It then extends that object's color rightwards until encountering a non-background cell or the grid edge.


These are just a few examples of how the "Program_to_be_generated" can be implemented using the provided DSL. By combining and modifying the functions in different ways, you can create a wide variety of solutions that achieve the desired transformation.
