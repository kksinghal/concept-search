## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects each non-background color pixel to the bottom-right corner of the grid with a line of that color.

**Input_0:**

- Each '1', '3', and '6' pixel is connected to the bottom-right corner with a line of the same color. 

**Input_1:**

-  Similar to Input_0, each non-zero pixel is connected to the bottom-right corner.

**Input_2:**

-  Again, we observe the same pattern of connecting non-zero pixels to the bottom-right corner using their respective colors. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    for loc in ofcolor(I, v):
      O = fill(O, v, connect(loc, lrcorner(toindices(O)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over colors:** We loop through each unique color `v` in the input grid `I`, excluding the background color.
2. **Find pixel locations:** For each color, we find all pixel locations `loc` with that color.
3. **Connect to corner:** We connect each `loc` to the bottom-right corner of the grid using `connect` and fill the line with color `v`.
4. **Update grid:** The grid `O` is updated with the filled line.
5. **Return modified grid:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = fill(O, color(obj), connect(ulcorner(obj), lrcorner(toindices(O))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition objects:** We partition the input grid `I` into objects based on color, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate over objects:** We loop through each object `obj`.
3. **Connect corner to object:** We find the top-left corner of the object and connect it to the bottom-right corner of the grid using `connect` and fill the line with the object's color.
4. **Update grid:** The grid `O` is updated with the filled line.
5. **Return modified grid:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), asobject(I))
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    O = fill(O, v, connect(first(ofcolor(I, v)), lrcorner(toindices(O))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:** We create a blank canvas `O` of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **Paint existing objects:** We paint the existing objects from the input grid `I` onto the canvas.
3. **Iterate over colors:** We loop through each unique color `v` in the input grid `I`, excluding the background color.
4. **Connect corner to first pixel:** We find the first pixel location of color `v` and connect it to the bottom-right corner of the grid, filling the line with color `v`.
5. **Update grid:** The grid `O` is updated with the filled line.
6. **Return modified grid:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = I
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    for i, j in ofcolor(I, v):
      O = fill(O, v, {(k, l) for k in range(i, h) for l in range(j, w)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get grid dimensions:** We get the height `h` and width `w` of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate over colors:** We loop through each unique color `v` in the input grid `I`, excluding the background color.
3. **Fill rectangle from pixel:** For each pixel location `(i, j)` of color `v`, we fill a rectangle starting from that pixel and extending to the bottom-right corner of the grid.
4. **Update grid:** The grid `O` is updated with the filled rectangle.
5. **Return modified grid:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    target = lrcorner(toindices(O))
    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), target[0] + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj), target[1] + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition objects:** We partition the input grid `I` into objects based on color, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate over objects:** We loop through each object `obj`.
3. **Get target corner:** We get the bottom-right corner `target` of the grid.
4. **Fill rectangle from object bounds:** We fill a rectangle starting from the top-left corner of the object and extending to the target corner, using the object's color.
5. **Update grid:** The grid `O` is updated with the filled rectangle.
6. **Return modified grid:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches using various DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired transformation. Each program effectively connects non-background pixels to the bottom-right corner, highlighting the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
