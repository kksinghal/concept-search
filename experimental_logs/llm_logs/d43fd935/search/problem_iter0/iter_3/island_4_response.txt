## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending horizontally objects (groups of connected, same-valued digits) towards the right, but only until they encounter another object with a different value. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '1' at (0,0) remains unchanged as there's no space to extend right.
* The '3' object extends right to fill the space until the '1' object. 
* The '6' objects remain unchanged as they are either blocked by other objects or the grid edge.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The '7' objects extend right until encountering '8' or '3' objects.
* The '8' objects remain unchanged, blocked by the grid edge or other objects.
* The '3' object remains unchanged, enclosed by '7' objects.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The '1' objects extend right until encountering the grid edge.
* The '3' object remains unchanged, blocked by the grid edge.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
        current_color = index(O, (i, j))
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and index(O, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The program iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Find extendable cells:**  It checks if a cell is not the background color and its right neighbor is the background color.
3. **Extend color:** If found, it extends the current cell's color to the right until it encounters a non-background color or the grid edge.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    max_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == color(obj):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  It identifies all objects (connected components) in the input grid.
2. **Create empty canvas:**  A new grid filled with the background color is created.
3. **Extend objects:**  For each object, it determines the leftmost and rightmost occupied columns. It then fills the canvas with the object's color in the corresponding rows, extending from the leftmost to the rightmost column.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)):
      if index(O, (uppermost(obj), j)) != mostcolor(I):
        fill_color = index(O, (uppermost(obj), j))
        k = j + 1
        while k <= rightmost(obj) and index(O, (uppermost(obj), k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, fill_color, {(uppermost(obj), k)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** The program iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Check for extendable cells:** For each object, it checks if a cell in the uppermost row is not the background color.
3. **Extend color:** If found, it extends the color to the right until encountering a non-background color or reaching the rightmost column of the object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and current_color is None:
        current_color = index(O, (i, j))
      elif current_color is not None and index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
      else:
        current_color = None
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Track current color:** It keeps track of the current color being extended.
3. **Extend color:**  It fills cells with the current color if they are background colored and following a non-background cell. The current color is reset upon encountering another non-background color.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(1, width(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j - 1)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j - 1)), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** The program iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check left neighbor:** It checks if the left neighbor of a cell is not the background color and the cell itself is the background color.
3. **Extend color:** If found, it fills the cell with the color of its left neighbor.

These five programs provide distinct approaches to achieve the same grid transformation. Each leverages different DSL functions and strategies to analyze and manipulate the input grid, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL and the creativity involved in program synthesis.
