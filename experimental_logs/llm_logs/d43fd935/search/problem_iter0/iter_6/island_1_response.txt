## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally towards the right, connecting them to other objects of the same color if they exist on the same row. 

**Input_0:**

* The '1' objects remain unchanged as there are no other '1' objects on the same row.
* The top-most '6' object remains unchanged.
* The remaining '6' objects extend rightwards to connect with the right-most '6' object. 
* The '3' objects extend rightwards to connect with the right-most '1' object.

**Input_1:**

* The lone '7' objects remain unchanged.
* The '7' object at (3,3) extends rightwards to connect with the '7' object at (3,5).
* The top-most '8' object extends rightwards to connect with the '8' object at (3,8).
* The bottom-most '8' object extends leftwards to connect with the '8' object at (7,1).

**Input_2:**

* All objects remain unchanged as there are no other objects of the same color on the same row.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if size(obj) > 1:
            for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
                right_indices = frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I)))
                for (i2, j2) in right_indices:
                    if index(I, (i2, j2)) == v:
                        O = fill(O, v, connect((i, j), (i2, j2)))
                        break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
2. **For each cell in the object:** Loop through each cell within the current object.
3. **Check for same-colored cells to the right:**  Identify cells to the right on the same row.
4. **Connect if match found:** If a cell with the same color is found, connect the current cell to it by filling the intermediate cells.
5. **Break inner loop:** Stop searching for a match after connecting to one. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        for (i, j) in ofcolor(I, v):
            for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
                if index(I, (i, k)) == v:
                    O = fill(O, v, connect((i, j), (i, k)))
                    break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:** Loop through each color in the input grid (excluding the background).
2. **Iterate through cells of the color:** Loop through each cell having the current color.
3. **Check for same-colored cells to the right:** Check for cells to the right on the same row with the same color.
4. **Connect if match found:** If found, connect the current cell to it by filling the intermediate cells.
5. **Break inner loop:** Stop searching after connecting.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, v in enumerate(row):
            if v != mostcolor(I):
                for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
                    if I[i][k] == v:
                        O = fill(O, v, connect((i, j), (i, k)))
                        break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** Loop through each row in the input grid.
2. **Iterate through cells in the row:** Loop through each cell in the current row.
3. **Check if not background:** If the cell is not the background color...
4. **Check for same-colored cells to the right:** Check for cells to the right on the same row with the same color.
5. **Connect if match found:** If found, connect the current cell to it.
6. **Break inner loop:** Stop searching after connecting.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if size(obj) > 1:
            min_j = min(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
            max_j = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
            i = next(i for _, (i, j) in obj)  # All cells in an object have the same row index
            O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((i, min_j), (i, max_j)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
2. **Find leftmost and rightmost cells:** For each object, find the column indices of its leftmost and rightmost cells. 
3. **Connect leftmost and rightmost:** Connect these two cells by filling the cells in between. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    h, w = shape(I)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            v = I[i][j]
            if v != mostcolor(I):
                for k in range(j + 1, w):
                    if I[i][k] == v:
                        O = fill(O, v, frozenset((i, l) for l in range(j, k + 1)))
                        break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:**  Directly iterate through each cell in the grid using row and column indices.
2. **Check if not background:** If the cell is not the background color...
3. **Check for same-colored cells to the right:**  Check for cells to the right with the same color.
4. **Fill cells between:** If found, directly fill all cells between the current cell and the matching cell.
5. **Break inner loop:** Stop searching after filling.
