## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects of certain colors in specific directions, filling the space between the original object and the edge of the grid.

* **Color 1 objects:** Extend downwards.
* **Color 3 objects:** Extend rightwards.
* **Other color objects:** Remain unchanged.

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The single '1' object extends downwards to the bottom of the grid.
* The '3' object extends rightwards to the edge of the grid. 
* The '6' objects remain unchanged.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

*  All '7' objects extend downwards to the bottom of the grid.
*  The '3' object extends rightwards to the '8' object.
*  The '8' objects remain unchanged.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

*  All '1' objects extend downwards to the bottom of the grid.
*  The '3' object extends rightwards to the edge of the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Initialize with background
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    c = mostcolor(obj)
    if c == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, connect(ulcorner(obj), (height(I)-1, ulcorner(obj)[1])))) # Extend down
    elif c == 3:
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], width(I)-1)))) # Extend right
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj) # Keep other colors unchanged
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Initializes an empty canvas with the background color.
2. Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. If the object's color is 1, it draws a vertical line from the object's upper-left corner to the bottom edge of the grid, filling it with color 1.
4. If the object's color is 3, it draws a horizontal line from the object's upper-left corner to the right edge of the grid, filling it with color 3.
5. For other colors, it paints the original object onto the canvas without modification.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    c = mostcolor(obj)
    if c == 1:
      O = underfill(O, c, {(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I))}) # Fill downwards
    elif c == 3:
      O = underfill(O, c, {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I))}) # Fill rightwards
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Starts with the input grid as the initial output.
2. Iterates through each object in the input.
3. For color 1 objects, it fills downwards from the object's uppermost row to the bottom of the grid, only overwriting background cells.
4. For color 3 objects, it fills rightwards from the object's leftmost column to the right edge of the grid, overwriting only background cells.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
        c = mostcolor(obj)
        if c == 1:
            O = paint(O, recolor(c, backdrop(shift(obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj), 0)))))
        elif c == 3:
            O = paint(O, recolor(c, backdrop(shift(obj, (0, width(I) - leftmost(obj))))))
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates an empty canvas filled with the background color.
2. Iterates through each object in the input.
3. If the object's color is 1, it shifts the object downwards beyond the grid boundary and then calculates the backdrop (bounding box) of this shifted object. Finally, it paints this backdrop onto the canvas with color 1.
4. If the object's color is 3, it follows a similar process, but shifts the object to the right beyond the grid boundary before calculating and painting the backdrop with color 3.
5. For other colors, it paints the original object onto the canvas directly.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    c = mostcolor(obj)
    if c == 1:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I)):
        O = paint(O, {(c, (i, j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1) if index(I, (i, j)) == mostcommon(I)}) # Fill downwards
    elif c == 3:
      for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I)):
        O = paint(O, {(c, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) if index(I, (i, j)) == mostcommon(I)}) # Fill rightwards
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Begins with the input grid as the initial output.
2. Iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. For each object with color 1:
    * It iterates through each row from the object's uppermost row to the bottom of the grid.
    * For each row, it iterates through the columns within the object's horizontal span.
    * If a cell in this range corresponds to the background color in the input grid, it paints that cell with color 1 in the output grid.
4. It follows a similar logic for objects with color 3, but iterates through columns first and then rows within the object's vertical span.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
        c = mostcolor(obj)
        if c == 1:
            O = paint(O, recolor(c, {(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(O))}))
        elif c == 3:
            O = paint(O, recolor(c, {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(O))}))
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a canvas initialized with the background color of the input grid.
2. Iterates through each object in the input.
3. If the object's color is 1:
    - It identifies the leftmost column of the object.
    - It paints a vertical line with color 1 on the canvas, starting from the uppermost row of the object and extending down to the bottom of the canvas, all along the identified column.
4. If the object's color is 3:
    - It identifies the uppermost row of the object.
    - It paints a horizontal line with color 3 on the canvas, starting from the leftmost column of the object and extending rightwards to the right edge of the canvas, all within the identified row.
5. For any other color, the program simply paints the object onto the canvas without any modifications.

These five versions utilize different approaches and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diverse solutions within the provided language.
