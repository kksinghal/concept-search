## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** Extend all objects to the right until reaching another object or the grid boundary.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:** Extend objects diagonally downwards and to the right until reaching another object or the grid boundary.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:** Extend objects vertically downwards until reaching another object or the grid boundary.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def extend_objects(I, direction):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      current = (i, j)
      next_cell = add(current, direction)
      while index(O, next_cell) == mostcolor(I) and next_cell in asindices(I):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {next_cell})
        current = next_cell
        next_cell = add(current, direction)
  return O

def program_version_1(I):
  return extend_objects(I, RIGHT)

# Example usage for Input 0:
# output_0 = program_version_1(input_0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_objects(I, direction)` Function:**
   - Takes the input grid `I` and a direction tuple `direction` as arguments.
   - Iterates through each object in the grid using `objects(I, True, False, False)`.
   - For each cell in the object, it keeps extending in the specified `direction` as long as the next cell is the background color and within the grid boundaries.
2. **`program_version_1(I)` Function:**
   - Takes the input grid `I` as an argument.
   - Calls `extend_objects(I, RIGHT)` to extend objects to the right.

### Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
        k = j + 1
        while index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I) and k < width(I):
          O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O

# Example usage for Input 0:
# output_0 = program_version_2(input_0)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Iterates through each cell in the grid row by row.
2.  If a cell is not the background color, it stores the cell's color and starts extending it to the right.
3.  The extension continues as long as the next cell is the background color and within the grid's bounds.
4.  This effectively extends all objects to the right until they encounter another object or the grid's edge.

### Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  transposed = dmirror(I)
  extended = program_version_2(transposed)
  return dmirror(extended)

# Example usage for Input 0:
# output_0 = program_version_3(input_0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:** Uses `dmirror(I)` to transpose the input grid, effectively swapping rows and columns. This allows reusing the horizontal extension logic for vertical extension.
2. **Extend:**  Applies `program_version_2` to the transposed grid, extending objects horizontally, which translates to vertical extension in the original grid.
3. **Transpose Back:** Uses `dmirror` again to transpose the grid back to its original orientation.

### Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    min_row, min_col = ulcorner(obj)
    max_row, max_col = lrcorner(obj)
    for i in range(min_row, height(I)):
      for j in range(min_col, width(I)):
        if (i, j) not in toindices(obj) and index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
        else:
          break
  return O

# Example usage for Input 0:
# output_0 = program_version_4(input_0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Loops through each object in the grid using `objects`.
2. **Find Object Boundaries:**  Determines the top-left and bottom-right corners of the object using `ulcorner` and `lrcorner`.
3. **Extend Right and Downwards:** Iterates from the object's top-left corner downwards and rightwards.
4. **Fill Background Cells:** If a cell is not part of the object and is the background color, it gets filled with the object's color.
5. **Stop at Non-Background:** The extension stops for a given row if a non-background cell is encountered.

### Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    min_col = leftmost(obj)
    max_col = max(width(I) - 1, max([j for _, (i, j) in obj if i == uppermost(obj)]))
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(min_col, max_col + 1):
        if j < width(I):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return O

# Example usage for Input 0:
# output_0 = program_version_5(input_0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** Initializes an output grid `O` filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate through Objects:**  Loops through each object in the input grid using `objects`.
3. **Determine Column Range:** Finds the leftmost column (`min_col`) and rightmost column (`max_col`) of the object. The `max_col` is determined by considering both the object's rightmost cell and the grid's boundary.
4. **Fill Rows:** For each row within the object's height, it fills cells from `min_col` to `max_col` with the object's color. This ensures the object is extended rightwards until it hits the grid boundary or another object.
