## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves extending objects horizontally towards the right until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The '1' objects at the top and bottom are extended rightwards.
* The '3' object is extended rightwards.
* The '6' objects remain unchanged as they are already touching other objects on their right.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The '7' objects are extended rightwards.
* The '3' object is extended rightwards.
* The '8' objects are extended rightwards.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The '1' objects are extended rightwards.
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it is already touching another object on its right.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(I)):
      for j in range(width(I)):
        if index(I, (i,j)) == color(obj):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == bg})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Background:** The code identifies all distinct objects in the grid (`objs`) and the background color (`bg`).
2. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates over each cell in the grid. If a cell belongs to an object, it fills all background cells to the right with the object's color until reaching another object or the edge.

**Program Version 2**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1,-1,-1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  Starts with an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Reverse Iteration and Fill:** It iterates over each row from right to left. Upon finding a non-background cell, it fills all cells to the right (including the current cell) with that color and breaks the inner loop, moving to the next row.

**Program Version 3**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = mostcolor(I)
    filling = False
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and not filling:
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
        filling = True
      if filling:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize and Iterate:** Begins with the output initialized as the input. It iterates through each row.
2. **Track Filling and Color:** It uses a flag (`filling`) to indicate if it's currently filling and stores the current object's color (`current_color`). 
3. **Fill Based on Flag:** If the flag is active, it fills the current cell with `current_color`. The flag is activated when encountering a non-background color and deactivated at the end of each row.

**Program Version 4**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
    rightmost_j = rightmost_cell[1][1]
    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(rightmost_cell[1][0], j) for j in range(rightmost_j, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Rightmost Cell:** For each object, it finds the rightmost cell within that object.
2. **Fill to the Right:** It then fills all cells to the right of the rightmost cell with the object's color.

**Program Version 5**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(I, (i, j+1)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j+1, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:**  Iterates through each cell in the grid (except the last column).
2. **Fill on Condition:** If a cell contains a non-background color and the cell to its right is the background, it fills all cells to the right with the current cell's color.
