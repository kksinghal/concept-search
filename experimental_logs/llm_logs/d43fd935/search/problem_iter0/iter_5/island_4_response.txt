## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects objects of the same color that are on the same row. It extends the object to the rightmost cell before encountering a different colored object or the edge of the grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '1' objects in rows 0 and 9 remain unchanged.
* The '3' object in rows 3 and 4 remain unchanged.
* The '6' objects in rows 1, 6, 7, 8 get connected to the rightmost cell before encountering a different colored object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '7' objects in rows 0, 2, 8, 9 get connected to the rightmost cell before encountering a different colored object.
* The '8' objects in rows 0, 2, 6, 7 get connected to the rightmost cell before encountering a different colored object.
* The '3' object in rows 3 and 4 remain unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The '1' objects in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 get connected to the rightmost cell before encountering a different colored object.
* The '3' object in rows 6 and 7 remain unchanged.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I):
          break
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output Grid:** Creates an output grid (`O`) filled with the background color, having the same shape as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** Loops through each object (`obj`) in the input grid, identified as contiguous areas of the same color.
3. **Paint Initial Object:**  Paints the current object (`obj`) onto the output grid (`O`).
4. **Extend Object Rightwards:** For each cell within the object, it checks for background color cells to the right and fills them with the object's color until a different color or the grid edge is encountered.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and current_color is None:
        current_color = index(O, (i, j))
      elif current_color is not None and index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
      else:
        current_color = None
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output Grid:** The output grid (`O`) is initially a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate Through Rows:**  The code iterates through each row (`i`) of the grid.
3. **Track Current Color:** A `current_color` variable is used to keep track of the color of the object being extended.
4. **Extend Rightwards:**  If a cell is encountered with the background color and a `current_color` is set, the cell is filled with `current_color`, effectively extending the object. 
5. **Reset Current Color:** If a cell is not the background color and `current_color` is not set, the `current_color` is updated to this new color. If a cell is not the background color and `current_color` is already set, then `current_color` is reset to `None`.

**Program Version 3:** (This version utilizes a slightly different logic and may require further tweaking to perfectly match the desired output)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for obj in objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I))), True, False, False):
            O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i, 0)))
            rightmost_cell = rightmost(obj)
            O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost_cell + 1, width(I))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output Grid:** Creates an output grid (`O`) filled with the background color, having the same shape as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate Through Rows:** Iterates through each row (`i`) of the input grid.
3. **Extract Row Objects:**  For each row, it extracts objects present in that row using `crop` and `objects`. 
4. **Paint and Extend:**  It paints the extracted object to the output grid at the correct row position using `shift`. Then, it fills the grid cells to the right of the object with the object's color up to the edge of the grid.

**Program Version 4:** (This version focuses on identifying the rightmost non-background cell of each row and then filling towards the left)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):
            if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
                fill_color = index(O, (i, j))
                O = fill(O, fill_color, {(i, k) for k in range(j, -1, -1) if index(O, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)})
                break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output Grid:** The output grid (`O`) is initially a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate Through Rows (Reverse):** The code iterates through each row (`i`) of the grid from right to left. 
3. **Find Rightmost Object Cell:** It searches for the first non-background cell (`fill_color`) from the right edge of the row.
4. **Fill Leftwards:** Once a non-background cell is found, it fills all background cells to the left of it with `fill_color` until it reaches a non-background cell or the left edge of the grid.

**Program Version 5:** (This version uses a combination of `hsplit` and list comprehension for a more functional approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    rows = hsplit(I, height(I))
    modified_rows = tuple(
        tuple(color if j <= max([idx for idx, val in enumerate(row) if val != mostcolor(I)] + [-1]) else mostcolor(I) for j, color in enumerate(row)) 
        for row in rows
    )
    return vconcat(*modified_rows)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split into Rows:** The input grid is split into individual rows using `hsplit`.
2. **Modify Each Row:** For each row:
   - It finds the index of the rightmost non-background cell.
   - It creates a new row where all cells up to and including the rightmost non-background cell retain their original color, and all cells after are filled with the background color.
3. **Recombine Rows:** The modified rows are vertically concatenated using `vconcat` to form the final output grid.


**Note:** These are five distinct approaches to solve the problem. You may need to adjust or further refine these programs based on additional test cases or specific nuances in the transformation logic.
