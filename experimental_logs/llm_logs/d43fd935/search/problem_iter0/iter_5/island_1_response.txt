## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending horizontally any object that has another object of the same color directly below it. The extension continues until it encounters another object (of any color) or reaches the edge of the grid.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**  The '1's, '3's, and '6's all get extended to the right because they have another object of the same color directly below them.
* **Input_1:** The '7's and '8's extend rightward for the same reason. Note that the isolated '7' at the bottom right doesn't extend because it has no '7' below it.
* **Input_2:**  Only the middle '1' extends because it's the only object with a matching color directly below.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I  # Initialize the output grid
    for v in palette(I):  # Iterate over each color in the input
        for i in range(len(I) - 1):  # Iterate over rows (except the last one)
            for j in range(len(I[0])):  # Iterate over columns
                if I[i][j] == v and I[i + 1][j] == v:  # Check if current and below cell have the same color
                    k = j + 1  # Start from the cell to the right
                    while k < len(I[0]) and I[i][k] == 0:  # Extend right until a non-zero cell or edge is encountered
                        O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})  # Fill the cell with the current color
                        k += 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors:**  The program iterates through each unique color (`v`) present in the input grid.
2. **Row-wise Check:** For each color, it scans the grid row by row (except the last row).
3. **Color Match and Extension:**  If a cell and the cell directly below share the same color, it starts extending to the right from the next column. 
4. **Filling and Boundary:**  The extension continues, filling cells with the current color (`v`), until it encounters a non-zero cell or reaches the grid's right edge.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Initialize output with all 0s
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Get all objects in the input
    for obj in objs:
        for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
            O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})  # Paint the original object
            if i < len(I) - 1 and I[i + 1][j] == v:  # If there's a same-color object below
                k = j + 1
                while k < len(I[0]) and I[i][k] == 0:
                    O = paint(O, {(v, (i, k))})  # Extend the object rightward
                    k += 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object-Based Approach:** This version identifies individual objects within the input grid using `objects`.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object, it paints the original object onto the output canvas and checks if a same-color object exists directly below. If so, it extends the object horizontally to the right on the canvas.

---

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I) - 1):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != 0 and I[i][j] == I[i + 1][j]:  # Matching colors vertically
                O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), (i, len(I[0]) - 1)))  # Fill rightward from current cell
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Extension:**  This version directly fills the output grid by identifying cells with matching colors directly below and extending them horizontally to the grid's right edge.
2. **Connect for Filling:** It leverages the `connect` function to draw a horizontal line (representing the extension) from the current cell to the rightmost edge.

---

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      connected = False
      for i in range(len(I) - 1, 0, -1):  # Iterate rows from bottom to top
        if I[i][j] == v and I[i - 1][j] == v:  # Check if current and above cell have the same color
          connected = True
        if connected and I[i][j] == v:
          O = fill(O, v, {(i, j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Bottom-up Approach:**  This version iterates through the grid columns and within each column, it traverses rows from bottom to top.
2. **Connect and Propagate:** If it finds two consecutive cells with the same color, it sets a 'connected' flag. As long as this flag is set and the current cell matches the target color, the cell is filled in the output grid, effectively extending the object downwards.

---

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(1, len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == I[i - 1][j]:  # Check for same color above
                O = fill(O, I[i][j], hfrontier((i, j)))  # Fill the entire row with that color
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Filling:** This version simplifies the logic by directly filling entire rows in the output grid.
2. **Color Matching:**  It iterates through rows from the second row onwards. If a cell has the same color as the cell directly above it, it fills the entire row in the output grid with that color using `hfrontier`.
