## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects in the input grid and extending them horizontally or vertically, based on their color, until they hit another object or the edge of the grid. 

**Object Identification:** Each object is a connected group of cells with the same color, considering diagonal connections.

**Color-Based Extension:**
- Objects with color **1** are extended **vertically downwards**.
- Objects with color **3** are extended **horizontally to the right**.
- Other colored objects remain unchanged.

**Extension Logic:** The extension continues until it encounters a non-background cell or reaches the grid boundary. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def extend_objects(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Initialize output with background color
    for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):  # Iterate over objects in input
        if mostcolor(obj) == 1:
            direction = DOWN
        elif mostcolor(obj) == 3:
            direction = RIGHT
        else:
            direction = (0, 0)  # No extension for other colors
        
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            k = 0
            while True:
                new_i, new_j = i + k * direction[0], j + k * direction[1]
                if 0 <= new_i < height(I) and 0 <= new_j < width(I) and index(I, (new_i, new_j)) == 0:
                    O = paint(O, {(mostcolor(obj), (new_i, new_j))})
                    k += 1
                else:
                    break  
        O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint the original object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty output grid filled with the background color of the input grid.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate over each object in the input grid.
3. **Direction Determination:** Determine the extension direction based on the object's color (down for 1, right for 3, no extension otherwise).
4. **Extension Loop:** For each cell in the object, extend in the determined direction by painting the output grid with the object's color until it hits another object or the grid boundary.
5. **Original Object Painting:** After extending, paint the original object onto the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def extend_objects(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    c = mostcolor(obj)
    if c == 1:
      O = paint(O, {(c, (i, rightmost(obj))) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I)) if index(I, (i, rightmost(obj))) == 0})
    elif c == 3:
      O = paint(O, {(c, (bottommost(obj), j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I)) if index(I, (bottommost(obj), j)) == 0})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate over each object in the input grid.
3. **Color-Specific Extension:**
    - If the object's color is 1, extend it downwards from its bottommost row by painting a vertical line.
    - If the object's color is 3, extend it rightwards from its rightmost column by painting a horizontal line.
4. **Conditional Painting:** Ensure that each cell being painted during the extension is originally a background cell (color 0).


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def extend_objects(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
        if mostcolor(obj) in (1, 3):
            start = (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)) if mostcolor(obj) == 1 else (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))
            direction = DOWN if mostcolor(obj) == 1 else RIGHT
            line = {(mostcolor(obj), (start[0] + k * direction[0], start[1] + k * direction[1])) 
                    for k in range(width(obj) if mostcolor(obj) == 1 else height(obj))  
                    if 0 <= start[0] + k * direction[0] < height(I) and 0 <= start[1] + k * direction[1] < width(I)}
            O = paint(O, obj | line)
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate over each object.
3. **Color-Based Action:** If the object's color is 1 or 3, determine the starting point and direction for the extension line. Create a set of cells representing the extension line, ensuring they fall within the grid boundaries. Combine the original object and the extension line and paint them onto the output grid. If the object's color is not 1 or 3, directly paint the object onto the output grid without extension.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def extend_objects(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    if mostcolor(obj) == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)), (height(I) - 1, rightmost(obj)))))
    elif mostcolor(obj) == 3:
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((bottommost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (bottommost(obj), width(I) - 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through each object in the input grid.
3. **Color-Specific Extension:** 
   - For objects with color 1, create a vertical line connecting the top-right corner to the bottom edge of the grid at the same column. Recolor this line to 1 and paint it on the output.
   - For objects with color 3, create a horizontal line connecting the bottom-left corner to the right edge of the grid at the same row. Recolor this line to 3 and paint it on the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def extend_objects(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    if mostcolor(obj) == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, lr[1]) for i in range(ul[0], height(I))}))
    elif mostcolor(obj) == 3:
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(lr[0], j) for j in range(ul[1], width(I))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterating through Objects:** The code then iterates through each object in the input grid, which are identified using the `objects` function.
3. **Color-Based Extension:**
   -  If `mostcolor(obj)` is 1 (meaning the object is primarily composed of the color 1), the code creates a vertical line extending downwards from the bottom of the object to the bottom of the grid, effectively extending the object vertically.
   - If `mostcolor(obj)` is 3, it creates a horizontal line extending rightwards from the right edge of the object to the right edge of the grid, extending the object horizontally. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation using various DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
