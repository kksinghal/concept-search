## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects to the right until they hit another object. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '3' object extends rightwards, covering the '1' to its right.
* The '6' object in the bottom left corner extends rightwards.
* The other objects remain unchanged as they are already touching other objects on their right.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The top-right '8' object extends leftwards, covering two '7's.
* The bottom-left '7' object extends rightwards.
* Other objects extend similarly, stopping upon encountering a non-background value.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The '1' objects extend rightwards.
* The '3' object remains unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program implementing the described transformation:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
    bg = mostcolor(grid)  # Get background color
    for obj in objs:
        for (i, j) in toindices(obj):  # Iterate over object cells
            for k in range(j + 1, width(grid)):  # Extend rightwards
                if index(grid, (i, k)) != bg:  # Stop at non-background
                    break
                grid = fill(grid, index(grid, (i, j)), {(i, k)})  # Fill cell
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all objects within the grid.
2. **Get Background Color:** Determine the background color for identifying empty cells.
3. **Iterate and Extend:** Loop through each object and its cells. For every cell, extend it rightwards by filling cells with the object's color until a non-background color is encountered.


**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    for i in range(height(grid)):
        for j in range(width(grid) - 1):
            if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid) and index(grid, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(grid):
                grid = fill(grid, index(grid, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(grid))})
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Row-wise:** Loop through each cell in the grid row by row.
2. **Identify Extension Point:** Check if the current cell belongs to an object and the cell to its right is background.
3. **Extend Rightwards:** If the condition holds, fill all cells to the right with the object's color until the end of the row.

**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)),
               merge({extend_obj(grid, obj) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T)}))

def extend_obj(grid, obj):
  return frozenset(
      (index(grid, (i, j)), (i, k)) for (i, j) in toindices(obj)
      for k in range(j, width(grid))
      if any(index(grid, (i, l)) != mostcolor(grid) for l in range(j, k)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify individual objects in the grid.
2. **Extend Objects:** For each object, calculate the extended version where it fills the space to its right until reaching another object.
3. **Combine and Paint:** Merge the extended objects and paint them onto a blank canvas of the original grid's size and background color.

**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return dmirror(extend_grid(dmirror(grid)))

def extend_grid(grid):
  for j in range(width(grid) - 1):
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):
        grid = fill(grid, index(grid, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(grid))})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mirror Grid:** Mirror the input grid diagonally.
2. **Extend Objects:** Extend objects in the mirrored grid downwards (which translates to rightwards in the original orientation) until they encounter another object.
3. **Mirror Back:** Mirror the extended grid diagonally again to obtain the final output.

**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    current_color = mostcolor(grid)  # Reset color for each row
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid) and current_color == mostcolor(grid):
        current_color = index(grid, (i, j))  # Update current color
      elif current_color != mostcolor(grid):
        grid = fill(grid, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Row-wise:** Loop through each cell in the grid row by row.
2. **Track Current Color:** Keep track of the current object color encountered in each row. 
3. **Extend Objects:** If the current cell is background but the `current_color` is set to an object color, fill the current cell with the `current_color`, effectively extending the object.
4. **Reset Color:** If a new object color is encountered or the row ends, reset the `current_color` to the background color.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version might have different performance characteristics depending on the specific input grid.
