## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-single cell objects and extending them horizontally to connect with other objects of the same color. Here's a breakdown:

**Input 0:**
* The '3' object extends rightward to connect with the single '1' cell.
* The '6' object extends rightward to connect with the other '6' objects.

**Input 1:**
* The '7' object in the center extends rightward to connect with the '3' object and further to the rightmost '8' object. 
* Other objects remain unchanged as they are already connected or single cells.

**Input 2:**
* The '1' objects remain unchanged as they are already connected vertically.
* The '3' object remains unchanged. 

Essentially, the transformation "pulls" objects horizontally towards others of the same color, creating a more connected output.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      for other_obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        if obj != other_obj and color(obj) == color(other_obj):
          if hmatching(obj, other_obj):
            O = fill(O, color(obj), connect(lrcorner(obj), llcorner(other_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through non-background objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` retrieves non-background objects.
2. **Check object size:**  Only objects larger than one cell are considered for extension.
3. **Find matching objects on the same row:**  Iterate through other objects to find those with the same color and sharing a row (`hmatching`).
4. **Connect horizontally:** If a matching object is found, connect the rightmost point of the current object (`lrcorner`) to the leftmost point of the matching object (`llcorner`) using `connect` and `fill`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I):
    if colorcount(I, v) > 1:
      obj_indices = ofcolor(I, v)
      while True:
        rightmost_points = [lrcorner(obj) for obj in objects(fill(I, 0, difference(asindices(I), obj_indices)), True, False, True) if color(obj) == v]
        connection_made = False
        for p1 in rightmost_points:
          for p2 in obj_indices:
            if p1[0] == p2[0] and p2[1] == p1[1] + 1:
              O = fill(O, v, connect(p1, p2))
              obj_indices = obj_indices | {p2}
              connection_made = True
        if not connection_made:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:**  Process each color separately.
2. **Find color occurrences:**  `ofcolor(I, v)` identifies indices of cells with the current color.
3. **Iterative extension:**
   - Find the rightmost points of connected components of the current color.
   - Check if any of these points can be connected to the existing object by moving one cell to the right.
   - If a connection is made, update the object indices and repeat the process.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 1:
      for other_obj in objs:
        if obj != other_obj and color(obj) == color(other_obj) and hmatching(obj, other_obj):
          min_dist = width(I)
          closest_point = None
          for i, j in toindices(other_obj):
            dist = abs(lrcorner(obj)[1] - j)
            if dist < min_dist:
              min_dist = dist
              closest_point = (i, j)
          O = fill(O, color(obj), connect(lrcorner(obj), closest_point))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through non-background objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Find matching objects on the same row:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Find closest point:** Instead of connecting to the leftmost point, find the closest point within the matching object to minimize unnecessary extension.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I):
    connected_components = objects(fill(I, 0, difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, v))), True, False, True)
    for i in range(len(connected_components) - 1):
      for j in range(i + 1, len(connected_components)):
        if color(connected_components[i]) == v and color(connected_components[j]) == v and hmatching(connected_components[i], connected_components[j]):
          O = fill(O, v, connect(lrcorner(connected_components[i]), llcorner(connected_components[j])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:** Similar to Version 2.
2. **Identify connected components:** Treat all cells of other colors as background and identify connected components of the current color.
3. **Connect components on the same row:** Connect any two components of the same color sharing a row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      right_frontier = {(lrcorner(obj)[0], lrcorner(obj)[1] + 1)}
      while True:
        intersection = right_frontier & asindices(I)
        if not intersection:
          break
        for i, j in intersection:
          if index(I, (i, j)) == color(obj):
            O = fill(O, color(obj), connect(lrcorner(obj), (i, j)))
            right_frontier = {(i, j + 1)}
            break
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through non-background objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Extend right frontier:**  Start from the right edge of the object and iteratively extend a frontier one cell to the right.
3. **Check for connection:**  If the frontier intersects with a cell of the same color, connect them and update the frontier.
