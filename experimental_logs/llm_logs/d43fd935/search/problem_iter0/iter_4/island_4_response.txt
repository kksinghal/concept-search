## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects objects of the same color along the horizontal axis. However, it only extends the object to the right until it hits another object.  Here's a breakdown for each example:

**Input 0:**

* The lone '1's remain unchanged.
* The '3' object extends right to connect with the '1' object.
* The '6' objects extend right to connect with each other or the edge of the grid. 

**Input 1:**

*  Lone '7's at (0,1), (9,9), and (9,6) remain unchanged.
*  The '7' object at (0,0) extends right to the edge.
*  The '7' object at (2,3) extends right to connect with the '3' object, which also extends right to connect with the '8' object. 
*  The '8' objects at (0,6) and (2,9) extend right to the edge.
*  Other lone '8's remain unchanged. 

**Input 2:**

* No objects are horizontally adjacent, so no changes occur.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I)):
        if index(O, (i, j)) == color(obj) and (i, j) not in toindices(obj):
          break
        if index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Iterate over Rows:** For each object, it iterates over its rows.
3. **Extend Rightward:** For each cell in a row, it extends the object's color to the right until it encounters a non-background cell or a cell already belonging to the object.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I):
          break
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  Start with a blank canvas of the input's size filled with the background color.
2. **Paint Original Objects:** Paint each object from the input onto the canvas.
3. **Extend Rightward:** For each cell in an object, extend its color rightward on the canvas until it encounters a non-background cell in the input.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and current_color is None:
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
      elif index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) and current_color is not None:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
      else:
        current_color = None
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Row-wise:** The code iterates over each row of the grid.
2. **Track Current Color:** It keeps track of the current object color being extended.
3. **Extend Color:** If the current cell is the background color and there's a current color being tracked, it fills the current cell with that color. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    max_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(min_j, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and j > max_j:
          break
        if j >= min_j and j <= max_j:
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
        else:
          if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
            break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Object Boundaries:** For each object, it determines its leftmost and rightmost column indices.
2. **Extend within Boundaries:** It iterates within these boundaries, filling cells with the object's color.
3. **Extend Beyond Boundaries:** It extends the object's color rightward beyond its original boundary until it encounters a non-background cell.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      k = j + 1
      while k < width(I) and index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k)})
        k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each cell within each object, it extends the object's color rightward as long as it encounters background cells. 


Each of these five versions provides a distinct approach to solving the given transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the DSL.
