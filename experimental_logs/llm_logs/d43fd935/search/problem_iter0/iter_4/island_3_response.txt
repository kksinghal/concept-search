## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to extend objects horizontally towards the right until they encounter another object or the grid boundary. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '1' objects at the top and bottom extend rightwards filling the empty spaces.
* The '3' object extends rightwards, stopping before the '1' object.
* The '6' objects remain unchanged as they either touch the grid boundary or another object on their right.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The '7' objects extend rightwards, stopping before the '8' objects or the boundary.
* The '8' objects remain unchanged, as they are blocked on the right.
* The '3' object extends rightwards until it hits the '8' object.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* All '1' objects extend rightwards until they encounter another '1' object or the boundary.
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it is blocked on its right.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_178fcbfb(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)  # Identify all objects in the grid
  extended_objs = frozenset({extend_right(grid, obj) for obj in objs}) # Extend each object to the right
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(extended_objs))  # Paint the extended objects onto a blank canvas
  return O

def extend_right(grid, obj):
  """Extends an object to the right until it encounters an obstacle."""
  obj_indices = toindices(obj)
  max_j = rightmost(obj_indices) 
  for j in range(max_j + 1, len(grid[0])):
    collision = False
    for i in range(uppermost(obj_indices), lowermost(obj_indices) + 1):
      if (i, j) in asindices(grid) and index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):
        collision = True
        break
    if collision:
      break
    obj_indices = obj_indices | frozenset({(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj_indices), lowermost(obj_indices) + 1)})
  return recolor(color(obj), obj_indices) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(grid, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Extend Right:** `extend_right` extends each object cell by cell to the right until it encounters another object or the grid boundary.
3. **Paint Objects:** A new canvas is created using `canvas` and `shape`. Then, the extended objects are painted onto this canvas using `paint` and `merge`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_178fcbfb(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
  extended_objs = mapply(rbind(extend_line, RIGHT), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), extended_objs)
  return O

def extend_line(obj, direction):
  """Extends an object in a given direction."""
  obj_indices = toindices(obj)
  for loc in obj_indices:
    current = loc
    while True:
      next_loc = add(current, direction)
      if next_loc not in asindices(grid) or index(grid, next_loc) != mostcolor(grid):
        break
      obj_indices = obj_indices | {next_loc}
      current = next_loc
  return recolor(color(obj), obj_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, `objects` is used.
2. **Extend Line:** `extend_line` extends the object in a specified direction (`RIGHT`) until it encounters a non-background cell or boundary. `rbind` is used to fix the direction argument.
3. **Paint Objects:** Similar to version 1, extended objects are painted on a new canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_178fcbfb(grid):
  return paint(grid, merge({extend_obj(grid, obj) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T)}))

def extend_obj(grid, obj):
  """Extends an object to the right by identifying its rightmost column and filling cells to the right."""
  rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
  new_cells = set()
  for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
    for j in range(rightmost_col + 1, len(grid[0])):
      if index(grid, (i,j)) == mostcolor(grid):
        new_cells.add((i, j))
      else:
        break  
  return recolor(color(obj), obj | frozenset(new_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects` like previous versions.
2. **Extend Object:** `extend_obj` determines the rightmost column of the object and iterates over cells to its right, adding background cells to the object until encountering a non-background cell.
3. **Paint Objects:** Directly paints the extended objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_178fcbfb(grid):
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(rbind(extend_obj_frontier, grid), objects(grid, T, F, T))))

def extend_obj_frontier(obj, grid):
  """Extends an object to the right using its right frontier."""
  frontier = {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j + 1 < len(grid[0]) and index(grid, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(grid)}
  while frontier:
    new_frontier = set()
    for i, j in frontier:
      if j + 1 < len(grid[0]) and index(grid, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(grid):
        new_frontier.add((i, j + 1))
    frontier = new_frontier
    obj = obj | recolor(color(obj), frozenset(frontier))
  return obj 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Uses `objects` as before.
2. **Extend Object Frontier:**  `extend_obj_frontier`  identifies the right frontier of the object and iteratively expands it to the right as long as it encounters background cells.
3. **Paint Objects:** Similar to version 3, directly paints the extended objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_178fcbfb(grid):
  extended_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    extended_grid = paint(extended_grid, extend_obj_line(grid, obj))
  return extended_grid

def extend_obj_line(grid, obj):
  """Extends each row of an object individually."""
  for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(grid[0])):
      if (i, j) in toindices(obj) or index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcolor(grid):
        obj = obj | {(color(obj), (i, j))} 
      else:
        break 
  return obj
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects` like previous versions.
2. **Extend Object Line:**  `extend_obj_line` iterates through each row of the object and extends it rightward until hitting a non-background cell or grid boundary. 
3. **Paint Objects:**  Paints the extended objects one by one onto a new canvas.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to the object extension problem within the constraints of the DSL, showcasing the flexibility and potential for creative solutions within the language.
