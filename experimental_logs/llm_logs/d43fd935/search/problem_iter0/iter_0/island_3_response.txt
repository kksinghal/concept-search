## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and extending them horizontally to the right until they hit another object or the edge of the grid. 

**Input_0:** 
- The '1' objects at (0,0) and (9,4) extend right to the edge.
- The '3' object extends right until it hits the extended '1' object. 
- The '6' objects extend right until they hit the edge or another '6' object.

**Input_1:** 
- Similar to Input_0, objects extend right until they encounter an obstacle.
- Notice how the '8' object at (2,8) doesn't extend into the '7' object on its right.

**Input_2:** 
- This example showcases that the extension doesn't "jump over" existing objects. The '1' objects remain separate. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions implementing the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(grid))
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      for j in range(leftmost_j, width(grid)):
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj) or index(new_grid, (i, j)) != bg:
          break
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return new_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(grid, T, F, T)` finds all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Prepare New Grid:** `canvas(bg, shape(grid))` creates an empty grid filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object:
   -  Find its `leftmost` column (`leftmost_j`).
   -  Iterate through each cell in the grid from `leftmost_j` to the right edge.
   -  If the cell is part of the object or already filled in the `new_grid`, stop extending on that row.
   -  Otherwise, fill the cell in `new_grid` with the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return paint(grid, merge({extend_right(grid, obj) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T)}))

def extend_right(grid, obj):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  extended_obj = set(obj)
  for i, j in toindices(obj):
    for k in range(j + 1, width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, k)) != bg:
        break
      extended_obj.add((color(obj), (i, k)))
  return frozenset(extended_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function `extend_right`:**
   - Takes the grid and an object as input.
   - Creates a copy of the object (`extended_obj`).
   - For each cell in the object:
      - Iterates to the right until it encounters a non-background cell.
      - Adds the traversed cells to `extended_obj`.
   - Returns the `extended_obj`.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Finds all objects using `objects(grid, T, F, T)`.
   - Uses `extend_right` to extend each object to the right.
   - Merges all extended objects using `merge`.
   - Paints the merged objects onto the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    grid = paint(grid, extend_object(grid, obj))
  return grid

def extend_object(grid, obj):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  new_obj = set(obj)
  for i, j in toindices(obj):
    k = j + 1 
    while k < width(grid) and index(grid, (i, k)) == bg:
      new_obj.add((color(obj), (i, k)))
      k += 1
  return frozenset(new_obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 2 but uses a `while` loop within `extend_object` for extension.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(w):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):
        current_color = index(grid, (i, j)) 
      if current_color is not None:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through the grid row by row.
- Tracks the `current_color` encountered on each row. 
- If a non-background color is found, it becomes the `current_color`.
- Fills the `new_grid` with the `current_color` until another non-background color or the end of the row is reached.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(extend_row(row, mostcolor(grid)) for row in grid))

def extend_row(row, bg):
  new_row = list(row)
  current_color = None
  for j, val in enumerate(row):
    if val != bg:
      current_color = val
    if current_color is not None:
      new_row[j] = current_color
  return tuple(new_row) 
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses a helper function `extend_row` to process each row individually.
-  `extend_row` extends the color similar to Version 4 but works directly on a single row. 
- Applies `extend_row` to each row in the grid using nested `tuple` comprehensions.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired grid transformation, showcasing the flexibility and power of the DSL. Each version leverages different functions and logic, providing diverse solutions to the problem.
