## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be connecting specific digit pairs within the grid by drawing a line of the same digit between them. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The two '3' digits are connected horizontally by a line of '1's, and the scattered '6' digits are connected vertically by a line of '6's.
**Input_1 to Output_1:** The '7' digits are connected diagonally by a line of '7's, and the '8' digits are connected horizontally by a line of '8's.
**Input_2 to Output_2:** The '1' digits are connected vertically by a line of '1's.

Essentially, the transformation identifies pairs or groups of identical digits and "fills in" the space between them with the same digit, creating connected components.


## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects without background
    x2 = lambda x: size(x) > 1  # Define condition for size > 1
    x3 = sfilter(x1, x2)  # Filter objects with size > 1
    x4 = lambda x: ulcorner(x)[0]  # Define key function for uppermost row
    x5 = order(x3, x4)  # Order objects based on uppermost row
    x6 = lambda obj: connect(centerofmass(first(obj)), centerofmass(last(obj)))
    O = fold(lambda acc, obj: fill(acc, color(obj), x6(obj)), I, x5)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid (excluding background).
2. **Filter by Size:** Filter objects to keep only those with a size greater than 1 (meaning more than one cell).
3. **Order Objects:** Order the remaining objects based on the row index of their uppermost cell.
4. **Connect Objects:** Iterate through the ordered objects and connect the center of mass of the first and last cells within each object using a line of the same color.
5. **Fill Grid:** Fill the input grid with the connected components, effectively drawing the lines.

## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for v in palette(I):
        x1 = ofcolor(I, v)  # Find indices of the current color
        x2 = size(x1)
        if x2 > 1:
            x3 = ulcorner(x1) 
            x4 = lrcorner(x1)
            O = fill(O, v, connect(x3, x4))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Colors:**  Iterate through each unique color (digit) present in the input grid.
2. **Find Indices:** Find all indices (locations) of cells containing the current color.
3. **Check Size:** If the number of indices found is greater than 1 (meaning there's more than one cell of that color), proceed.
4. **Get Corners:** Find the upper-left and lower-right corner indices of the current color group.
5. **Connect and Fill:** Connect these corners with a line of the same color and fill it on the output grid.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if size(obj) > 1:
            x1 = lambda x: x[1][0]  # Key function for sorting by row
            x2 = order(obj, x1)  # Order object cells by row
            x3 = lambda x: x[1][1]  # Key function for sorting by column
            x4 = order(x2, x3)  # Order object cells by column
            x5 = first(x4)
            x6 = last(x4)
            O = fill(O, color(obj), connect(x5[1], x6[1]))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Iterate:** Extract all objects from the grid and iterate through them.
2. **Filter by Size:**  Only process objects with more than one cell.
3. **Order Cells:** Order the cells within each object first by row index and then by column index. 
4. **Get Extreme Cells:** Get the first and last cells after ordering, representing the extremes of the object.
5. **Connect and Fill:** Connect these extreme cells' indices with a line of the object's color and fill it on the output grid.

## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    x2 = lambda obj: (size(obj) > 1, -ulcorner(obj)[0])  # Tuple for sorting: (size > 1, -uppermost row)
    x3 = order(x1, x2)  # Order by size and uppermost row
    O = fold(lambda acc, obj: fill(acc, color(obj), connect(ulcorner(obj), lrcorner(obj))), I, x3)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract all objects from the grid (excluding the background).
2. **Prioritize by Size and Location:** Create a sorting key that prioritizes objects with size greater than 1 and then orders them based on their uppermost row index (in descending order).
3. **Connect and Fill:** Iterate through the sorted objects and connect their upper-left and lower-right corners with a line of the same color on the output grid.

## Program Version 5

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    x1 = palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}  # Get colors excluding background
    for v in x1:
        indices = ofcolor(I, v)  # Get indices of the current color
        while size(indices) > 1:
            x2 = lambda x: x[0] * 100 + x[1]  # Custom key for sorting indices
            x3 = order(indices, x2)  # Order indices to find extremes
            start = first(x3)
            end = last(x3)
            O = fill(O, v, connect(start, end))  # Connect extremes with the color
            indices = remove(start, indices)  # Remove connected indices 
            indices = remove(end, indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Foreground Colors:** Iterate through each unique color in the input grid, excluding the background color.
2. **Find and Connect Extremes:** For each color, repeatedly:
    - Find the "extreme" indices (farthest apart) of that color.
    - Connect these extreme points with a line of the same color on the output grid.
    - Remove the connected indices to find new extremes in the remaining set.
3. **Continue Until Connected:** This process continues until all indices of the same color are connected into a single component. 

**Note:** These are just a few examples, and many other valid programs could be constructed using the provided DSL functions. The key is to break down the transformation logic into steps that can be expressed using the available functions.
