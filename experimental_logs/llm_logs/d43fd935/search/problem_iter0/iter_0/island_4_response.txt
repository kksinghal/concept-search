## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects based on color connectivity and extending them horizontally to the right until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** The '1' objects at the top and bottom remain unchanged. The '3' object extends right to become '3 3 1 1 1 1 1 0'. The '6' objects extend right to the edge of the grid. 
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:** The '7' objects on the left and bottom right remain unchanged. The top '8' object extends right to the edge. The '7' object in the middle extends right to meet the '3' object. The '8' objects in the right middle and bottom middle extend right to the edge.
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:** All the '1' objects extend right until they reach another '1' object or the edge. The '3' object remains unchanged. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with a detailed explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    new_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        ul = ulcorner(obj)
        right_extension = frozenset((color(obj), (ul[0], j)) for j in range(ul[1], width(I)))
        new_objs.add(obj | intersection(right_extension, delta(obj)))
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Extend Right:** For each object, we calculate a `right_extension` set of indices extending from the object's right edge to the grid's right edge.
3. **Intersect with Delta:** We intersect the `right_extension` with the `delta` of the object. The delta contains indices surrounding the object but not part of it. This ensures we only fill empty space.
4. **Combine and Paint:** We combine the original object with the valid extension and paint it onto a blank canvas of the original grid's size.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I) - 1):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I) and index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Fill:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid, moving column by column. 
2. **Check Condition:** If a cell's right neighbor is the background color (`mostcolor(I)`) and the cell itself is not the background, we fill the right neighbor with the cell's color.
3. **In-Place Modification:** This version modifies the grid in-place, iteratively filling cells.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    start = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))
    color = color(obj)
    for j in range(start[1], width(I)):
      if index(I, (start[0], j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, color, {(start[0], j)})
      else:
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** This version iterates through each object.
2. **Extend Line:** For each object, it draws a horizontal line from the object's leftmost point (`start`) to the right. 
3. **Stop at Non-Background:**  The line drawing stops when it encounters a non-background color in the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        current_color = None
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and current_color is None:
                current_color = index(I, (i, j))
            if current_color is not None:
                O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** This version iterates row by row.
2. **Track Color:** It tracks the current `current_color` encountered in each row.
3. **Fill Until End:** If a non-background color is encountered, it fills subsequent cells with that color until the end of the row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      start_j = leftmost(shift(obj, (i, 0)))
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i + uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(start_j, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects and Rows:**  Iterates through each object and then each row within the object's bounding box.
2. **Find Starting Point:** Determines the leftmost point of the object in that specific row.
3. **Fill to the Right:**  Fills from the starting point to the right edge of the grid. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages distinct logic and function combinations, showcasing diverse solutions to the problem.
