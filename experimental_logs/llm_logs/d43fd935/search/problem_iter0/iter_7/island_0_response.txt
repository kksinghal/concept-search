## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending objects horizontally towards the edges of the grid, but only if the path is clear (i.e., filled with the background color). It does not extend objects vertically.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
* The '1' objects at the top and bottom are extended to the edges of the grid.
* The '3' object is extended to the right until it hits the '1' object. 
* The '6' objects are extended to the left and right edges.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The '7' objects on the left and right edges are extended vertically to the top and bottom edges.
* The '8' objects at the top and bottom are extended to the edges.
* A '7' object is inserted between the two '8' objects on the right side.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The '1' objects on the left and right are extended vertically, but stop before hitting the '3' object.
* The '3' object remains unchanged. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Identify objects excluding background
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, -1, -1): # Extend left
      if index(I, (uppermost(obj), j)) != bg:
        break
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})
    for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, w): # Extend right
      if index(I, (uppermost(obj), j)) != bg:
        break
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies distinct objects in the input grid (excluding the background) using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterates over each identified object.
3. **Horizontal Extension:** For each object:
    * **Extend Left:** Extends the object leftward by filling cells with the object's color (`fill`) until it encounters a non-background cell or reaches the grid boundary.
    * **Extend Right:** Similarly, extends the object rightward.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != bg:
        current_color = index(O, (i, j))
        # Extend left
        k = j - 1
        while k >= 0 and index(O, (i, k)) == bg:
          O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, k)})
          k -= 1
        # Extend right
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and index(O, (i, k)) == bg:
          O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Horizontal Extension:** If a cell is not the background color:
    * **Extend Left:**  Extends the color leftward until it hits a non-background cell or the grid boundary.
    * **Extend Right:**  Extends the color rightward similarly.
3. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    uppermost_i = uppermost(obj)
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if leftmost_j <= j <= rightmost_j or index(I, (uppermost_i, j)) != bg:
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost_i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Background:** Identifies objects and background color.
2. **Create Blank Canvas:** Creates a blank grid filled with the background color.
3. **Process Objects:**  Iterates through each object:
   * **Horizontal Filling:**  Fills the entire row occupied by the object on the blank canvas, extending it horizontally.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the modified canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  for i in range(height(I)):
    start_j = -1
    end_j = -1
    current_color = bg
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != bg:
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
        if start_j == -1:
          start_j = j
        end_j = j
    if start_j != -1:
      O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j) for j in range(start_j, end_j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** Iterates through each row.
2. **Find Object Boundaries:**  Finds the starting and ending column indices of objects (non-background colors) in the row.
3. **Fill Row Segment:** If an object is found, fills the entire row segment between the starting and ending indices with the object's color.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  for row in range(height(I)):
    for col in range(width(I)):
      if index(O, (row, col)) != bg:
        # Extend left
        left_col = col - 1
        while left_col >= 0 and index(O, (row, left_col)) == bg:
          O = fill(O, index(O, (row, col)), {(row, left_col)})
          left_col -= 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:**  Iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Extend Left:** If a cell is not the background color, it extends the color leftward, filling cells with the object's color until it reaches a non-background cell or the grid boundary.
3. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid.
