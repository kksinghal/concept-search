## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as **extending objects horizontally towards the right until they encounter another object with a different color.** The background color should not be extended.

Here are the specific transformations observed for each input-output pair:

**Input 0:**

* The '1's and '6's are extended rightward until they encounter the next '1' or '6'.
* The '3's are extended rightward until they encounter the '1'.

**Input 1:**

* The '7's and '8's are extended rightward until they encounter the next '7' or '8'. 

**Input 2:**

* The '1's are extended rightward until they encounter the next '1'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)  # Identify all foreground objects
  bg = mostcolor(grid)  # Identify background color
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(grid)) # Create a blank canvas filled with background color
  for obj in objs:
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj): # Iterate over each cell of the object
      for k in range(j, width(grid)): # Extend horizontally to the right
        if index(grid, (i, k)) != bg and (i, k) not in toindices(obj): # Stop if encountering another object (different color)
          break
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, k)}) # Fill the cell on the new grid
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:** This program identifies all foreground objects and iterates through each cell of every object. It then extends the color of that cell to the right until it encounters a cell with a different color than the background and the current object.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)  # Identify all foreground objects
  new_grid = paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(objs)) # Create canvas and paint objects
  for obj in objs:
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, width(grid)):
        if index(new_grid, (i, k)) != mostcolor(grid):
          break
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, k)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:** This version first paints all the objects onto a blank canvas. Then it iterates through each object and extends its color to the right until it encounters a cell that is not the background color.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid):
        current_color = grid[i][j]
      if current_color is not None:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**  This version simplifies the logic by iterating through each row and keeping track of the "current_color". If a cell is not the background, its color becomes the "current_color" and gets filled in the new grid until another non-background color is encountered.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          next((v for v in row[j:] if v != mostcolor(grid)), mostcolor(grid))
          for j in range(len(row))
      )
      for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:** This version uses a more functional approach, using nested generator expressions. It iterates over each row and, for each cell, finds the next non-background color in the remaining part of the row, or uses the background color if none is found.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = list(list(row) for row in grid)  # Create a mutable copy of the grid
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid):
        k = j + 1
        while k < w and grid[i][k] == mostcolor(grid):
          new_grid[i][k] = grid[i][j]  # Extend the color rightward
          k += 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)  # Convert back to immutable tuples
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through the grid and, when it encounters a non-background color, it extends that color to the right in a mutable copy of the grid until it hits another non-background color. 

These five program versions all achieve the desired transformation using different logic and DSL function combinations. Each version provides a unique approach to solving the problem.
