## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**  Objects of color "1" extend rightwards to connect with other objects of the same color. Objects of color "6" extend downwards to connect with other objects of the same color.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**  Objects of color "7" extend rightwards and downwards to connect with other objects of the same color. Objects of color "8" extend rightwards to connect with other objects of the same color.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**  Objects of color "1" extend downwards to connect with other objects of the same color. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

We can observe a pattern: objects extend either horizontally or vertically to connect with other objects of the same color. We can achieve this by iterating through each object and checking for the same colored objects in its horizontal and vertical directions. If found, we fill the space between them with the object's color.

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for direction in [RIGHT, DOWN]:
      O = efbadbheidebebecaegaajabjgicfbfh(O, direction)
  return O

def efbadbheidebebecaegaajabjgicfbfh(I, direction):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      current = (i, j)
      next_cell = add(current, direction)
      while index(O, next_cell) == mostcolor(I) and next_cell in asindices(I):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {next_cell})
        current = next_cell
        next_cell = add(current, direction)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Program_to_be_generated(I):**
   - Iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
   - Calls the helper function `efbadbheidebebecaegaajabjgicfbfh` for both rightward and downward directions.
2. **efbadbheidebebecaegaajabjgicfbfh(I, direction):**
   - Iterates over each cell of each object.
   - Checks for the same colored object in the given `direction`.
   - If found, fills the space between them with the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    O = extend_object(O, obj, RIGHT)
    O = extend_object(O, obj, DOWN)
  return O

def extend_object(grid, obj, direction):
  for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
    k = 1
    while True:
      next_cell = add((i, j), multiply(direction, k))
      if index(grid, next_cell) == color(obj):
        grid = fill(grid, color(obj), connect((i, j), next_cell))
        break
      elif index(grid, next_cell) != mostcolor(grid) or not(next_cell in asindices(grid)):
        break
      k += 1
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Program_to_be_generated(I):**
   - Iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
   - Calls the helper function `extend_object` for both rightward and downward directions.
2. **extend_object(grid, obj, direction):**
   - Iterates over each cell of the object.
   - Extends a line from the cell in the given `direction`.
   - If the line encounters another cell of the same color, it fills the space between them.
   - If the line encounters a different color or the grid boundary, it stops extending.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    O = connect_same_color(O, obj, lambda x, y: (x, y + 1))  # Connect horizontally
    O = connect_same_color(O, obj, lambda x, y: (x + 1, y))  # Connect vertically
  return O

def connect_same_color(grid, obj, next_cell_func):
  for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
    current = (i, j)
    while True:
      next_cell = next_cell_func(*current)
      if next_cell in asindices(grid) and index(grid, next_cell) == color(obj):
        grid = fill(grid, color(obj), connect(current, next_cell))
        current = next_cell
      else:
        break
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Program_to_be_generated(I):**
   - Iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
   - Calls the helper function `connect_same_color` twice - once for horizontal connection and once for vertical connection.
2. **connect_same_color(grid, obj, next_cell_func):** 
   - Takes an additional argument `next_cell_func` which is a lambda function defining how to move to the next cell (horizontally or vertically). 
   - For each cell of the object, it connects it to the next cell of the same color in the specified direction using the `next_cell_func`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for d in [RIGHT, DOWN]:
    O = connect_objects(O, d)
  return O

def connect_objects(grid, direction):
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):
        k = 1
        while True:
          next_cell = add((i, j), multiply(direction, k))
          if next_cell in asindices(grid) and index(grid, next_cell) == index(grid, (i, j)):
            grid = fill(grid, index(grid, (i, j)), connect((i, j), next_cell))
            break
          elif next_cell not in asindices(grid) or index(grid, next_cell) != mostcolor(grid):
            break
          k += 1
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Program_to_be_generated(I):** 
   - Iterates through both rightward and downward directions.
   - For each direction, it calls the `connect_objects` function.
2. **connect_objects(grid, direction):**
   - Iterates through each cell of the grid.
   - If the cell is not a background color, it tries to connect it to other cells of the same color in the given `direction`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    O = extend_and_connect(O, obj, RIGHT)
    O = extend_and_connect(O, obj, DOWN)
  return O

def extend_and_connect(grid, obj, direction):
  new_cells = set()
  for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
    k = 1
    while True:
      next_cell = add((i, j), multiply(direction, k))
      if next_cell in asindices(grid):
        if index(grid, next_cell) == color(obj):
          for l in range(1, k):
            new_cells.add(add((i, j), multiply(direction, l)))
          break
        elif index(grid, next_cell) != mostcolor(grid):
          break
      else:
        break
      k += 1
  return fill(grid, color(obj), frozenset(new_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Program_to_be_generated(I):**
   - Iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
   - Calls the helper function `extend_and_connect` for both rightward and downward directions.
2. **extend_and_connect(grid, obj, direction):**
   - Iterates over each cell of the object.
   - Extends a line from the cell in the given `direction` until it encounters either the grid boundary or a cell with a different color.
   - If the line encounters another cell of the same color before encountering a different color or the boundary, it marks all the cells between the starting cell and the encountered cell to be filled.
   - Finally, it fills all the marked cells with the object's color.


These are five distinct code versions that implement the desired transformation in the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different logic or function combinations to achieve the same output.
