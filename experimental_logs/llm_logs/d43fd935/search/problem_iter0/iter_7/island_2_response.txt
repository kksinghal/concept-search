## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending objects of specific colors horizontally or vertically until they hit another object or the edge of the grid.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- Objects with color '1' are extended downwards.
- Objects with color '3' are extended rightwards.
- Other colored objects remain unchanged.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Objects with color '7' are extended rightwards.
- Objects with color '8' are extended downwards.
- Other colored objects remain unchanged.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Objects with color '1' are extended downwards.
- Other colored objects remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def extend_objects(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Initialize with background
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    c = mostcolor(obj)
    if c == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, backdrop(shift(obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj) - 1, 0)))))  # Extend down
    elif c == 3:
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, backdrop(shift(obj, (0, width(I) - leftmost(obj) - 1)))))  # Extend right
    elif c == 7:
        O = paint(O, recolor(c, backdrop(shift(obj, (0, width(I) - leftmost(obj) - 1)))))  # Extend right for color 7
    elif c == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(c, backdrop(shift(obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj) - 1, 0)))))  # Extend down for color 8
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Keep other colors unchanged
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a canvas `O` with the background color of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Color Check:**  Identifies the color `c` of the current object.
4. **Extension Logic:**
    - If `c` is 1, extends the object downwards using `backdrop` and `shift` to fill the entire column below the object.
    - If `c` is 3, extends the object rightwards using `backdrop` and `shift` to fill the entire row to the right of the object.
    - Similarly, handles extension for colors 7 and 8.
    - Otherwise, keeps the object unchanged.
5. **Painting:** Paints the modified object onto the canvas `O`.
6. **Return:** Returns the transformed canvas `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def extend_objects(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    c = mostcolor(obj)
    if c == 1:
      O = underfill(O, c, {(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I))})
    elif c == 3 or c == 7:
      O = underfill(O, c, {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I))})
    elif c == 8:
        O = underfill(O, c, {(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `underfill` for a more efficient painting process. It directly modifies the input grid `I` to generate the output `O`. The logic for extending objects based on color remains the same as in Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def extend_objects(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for c in palette(I):
    if c == mostcommon(I): continue
    obj = next(ob for ob in objects(I, True, True, True) if color(ob) == c)
    if c == 1 or c == 8:
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, connect(ulcorner(obj), (height(I) - 1, ulcorner(obj)[1]))))
    elif c == 3 or c == 7:
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], width(I) - 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each unique color in the input grid and extends objects of that color. It uses `connect` and `recolor` to create the extended objects directly. This approach might be less efficient for grids with many small objects of the same color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def extend_objects(I):
  O = I
  for c in (1, 3, 7, 8):  # Directly specify colors to extend
    for obj in sfilter(objects(I, True, True, True), lambda x: color(x) == c):
      if c in (1, 8):
        O = underfill(O, c, {(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I))})
      else:  # c is 3 or 7
        O = underfill(O, c, {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly specifies the colors to extend (1, 3, 7, 8) and iterates through objects of those colors. This avoids unnecessary checks for other colors. It uses `sfilter` to efficiently select objects of the desired color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def extend_objects(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, True, True, True):
        c = color(obj)
        extension_direction = {1: DOWN, 3: RIGHT, 7: RIGHT, 8: DOWN}.get(c, (0, 0))
        if any(extension_direction):
            start_point = ulcorner(obj)
            end_point = (start_point[0] + extension_direction[0] * (height(I) - 1),
                         start_point[1] + extension_direction[1] * (width(I) - 1))
            O = paint(O, recolor(c, connect(start_point, end_point)))
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a dictionary to map colors to their corresponding extension directions. It simplifies the code by avoiding repetitive conditional statements. It uses `connect` to create the extended lines and efficiently handles object extension based on the defined direction.

These are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided. Each version implements the same transformation logic but employs different functions and approaches. Choosing the most efficient version depends on factors like the size of the input grid and the distribution of object colors.
