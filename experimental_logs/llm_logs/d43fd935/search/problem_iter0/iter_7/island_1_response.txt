## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes all non-background objects and extends them diagonally towards the lower right corner of the grid until they hit another object or the edge of the grid.  

**Let's break it down for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' object extends right and down, the '3' object extends down, and the '6' objects extend down and right. 
* **Input_1:** The '7' objects extend down and right, the '3' object extends down, and the '8' objects extend right.
* **Input_2:** The '1' objects extend down and right, and the '3' object extends down.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, index(I,(i,j)), connect((i, j), (len(I)-1, len(I[0])-1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each non-background object in the grid.
2. **Extend Diagonally:** For each cell within the object, it draws a line from the cell's location to the lower right corner of the grid.
3. **Fill with Original Color:** The line is filled with the object's original color, effectively extending the object diagonally.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        for loc in ofcolor(I, v):
            O = fill(O, v, connect(loc, lrcorner(I))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors:** This version iterates through each color in the grid except the background color.
2. **Iterate through Cells of Color:** For each color, it iterates through all cells with that color.
3. **Extend Diagonally:**  A line is drawn from each cell to the lower right corner, effectively extending the object diagonally.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = underfill(O, color(obj), backdrop(shift(obj, (1,1))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:**  The code iterates through each non-background object.
2. **Shift and Get Backdrop:** It shifts the object diagonally down-right by one cell and calculates the backdrop (bounding box indices) of the shifted object. 
3. **Underfill:** It then fills the backdrop with the object's color, but only where the background color is present. This creates the diagonal extension.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        obj = ofcolor(I, v)
        target = lrcorner(obj)
        for loc in obj:
            O = fill(O, v, connect(loc, target))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Non-Background Colors:** This version iterates through all colors present in the grid that are not the background color.
2. **Find Target Corner:** For each color, it finds the lower right corner of the object formed by cells of that color.
3. **Extend to Target:**  It then iterates through each cell of that color and draws a line from the cell to the identified target corner.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    direction = (1,1)
    for cell in obj:
      current = cell[1]
      while True:
        next_cell = add(current, direction)
        if next_cell[0] >= height(I) or next_cell[1] >= width(I) or index(I, next_cell) != mostcolor(I):
          break
        O = fill(O, cell[0], {next_cell})
        current = next_cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate over Non-Background Objects:** The code starts by iterating over each non-background object identified in the input grid.
2. **Diagonal Extension:** For every cell within an object, the code enters a loop that progressively checks cells in a diagonal direction (down and to the right).
3. **Fill Until Boundary:**  If the next diagonal cell is within the grid's boundaries and has the background color, it gets filled with the current object's color. This process effectively extends the object diagonally until it hits either another object or the grid's edge. 

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired diagonal extension transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic.
