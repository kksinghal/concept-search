## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve extending objects horizontally to the right until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The "1" object at (0,0) remains unchanged.
* The "1" object at (9,4) remains unchanged.
* The "3" object at (3,2) extends right to become "3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1".
* The "6" objects at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6) and (8,5) extend right to the edge of the grid.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The "7" objects at (0,1), (8,0), (9,5) remain unchanged.
* The "8" objects at (0,6), (1,6), (6,7) and (7,3) extend right to the edge of the grid.
* The "7" object at (2,3) extends right to become "7 7".
* The "3" object at (2,5) extends right to become "3 3 8 8 8 8".

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* All "1" objects remain unchanged.
* The "3" object at (6,4) extends right to the edge of the grid.


## Code Generation:

Since I don't have access to the two specific programs mentioned in the prompt, I'll provide five distinct program versions using the provided DSL and inspired by the general approach of Program A and B, incorporating elements of object manipulation and grid operations:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify all objects
    bg = mostcolor(I)  # Determine background color
    filled_grid = I  # Initialize filled grid
    for obj in objs:
        leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
        for i in range(height(I)):
            for j in range(leftmost_j, width(I)):
                if (i, j) in toindices(obj):  # Extend object rightwards
                    filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
                elif index(filled_grid, (i, j)) == bg:  # Stop at other objects
                    break
    O = filled_grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and background:** We first identify all distinct objects in the grid and the background color.
2. **Iterate and extend:** For each object, we iterate through grid rows starting from the object's leftmost column.
3. **Extend rightward:** If a cell belongs to the current object, we fill all cells to the right with the object's color.
4. **Stop at obstacles:**  We stop filling when we encounter a non-background cell, indicating another object or the grid edge.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify all objects
    new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create empty canvas
    for obj in objs:
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            new_grid = fill(new_grid, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))}) # Fill from current position to the right
    O = new_grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to Version 1, we identify all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Create empty canvas:** We create a new grid filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input.
3. **Iterate and fill:** We iterate over each cell of each object.
4. **Fill rightward:** For each cell belonging to an object, we fill the new grid with the object's color from that cell's column to the right edge. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
        for i in range(height(I)):
            if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I): # Check for object edge
                O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))}) # Fill to the right
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** We iterate through each column of the grid from left to right.
2. **Detect object edges:** For each cell, we check if it belongs to an object and if the cell to its right is the background.
3. **Fill rightward:** If we find an object edge, we fill the grid with the object's color from that edge to the right.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    shifted_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create empty canvas
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        for x in range(width(I)):
            shifted_object = shift(obj, (0, x)) # Shift object to the right
            shifted_grid = paint(shifted_grid, toobject(shifted_object, I)) # Paint shifted object onto canvas
    O = shifted_grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and initialize canvas:** Similar to previous versions, we identify objects and create an empty canvas.
2. **Shift and paint:** For each object, we shift it horizontally to each column position and paint it onto the canvas. This effectively extends each object rightward.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create empty canvas
  for obj in objs:
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      grid = fill(grid, v, {(i, x) for x in range(j, width(grid))}) # Fill each object cell to the right edge
  O = grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** We start by getting all the objects in the input grid and creating a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterating and Filling:** For each object found, we iterate through its cells. For each cell, we obtain its color (v) and its coordinates (i, j). Then, we fill the canvas with the object's color from the current column (j) to the rightmost edge of the canvas.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation in the provided DSL. Each version utilizes various functions and logic, offering distinct approaches to solve the problem. Remember that these programs are just examples. You can always combine different functions from the DSL to create new and efficient solutions!
