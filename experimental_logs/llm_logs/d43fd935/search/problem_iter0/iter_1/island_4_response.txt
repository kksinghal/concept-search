## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves extending the horizontal lines of non-background color to the right until they encounter another non-background color or the edge of the grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The single '1' pixels remain unchanged.
- The horizontal lines of '3's extend right to the '1's.
- The horizontal line of '6's extends right to the other '6's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
-  The single '7' pixels remain unchanged.
- The horizontal line of '8's in the top right extends left to the '7'.
- The horizontal lines of '7's in the bottom left extend right to the '8's and '3's.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The horizontal lines of '1's extend right until another '1'.
- The horizontal line of '3's remain unchanged.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using functions from the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      O = fill(O, v, connect((i, j), (i, width(I) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates a canvas `O` filled with the background color of the input `I`, having the same dimensions as `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates over each object in the input `I`, excluding the background, using `objects(I, False, False, True)`. 
3. **Fill Horizontal Lines:** For each cell `(v, (i, j))` in the object, it draws a horizontal line of color `v` from the cell's column `j` to the right edge of the canvas using `fill(O, v, connect((i, j), (i, width(I) - 1)))`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Cells:** Iterates over each cell in the grid `O` except the last column.
3. **Extend Line:** If a cell is non-background and its right neighbor is background, fill the right neighbor with the cell's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
      if current_color is not None:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Iterates over each row `i` in the grid.
3. **Track Color:** Keeps track of the current non-background color encountered in the row.
4. **Fill Cells:** Fills the cells in the row with the `current_color` until encountering a different non-background color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    start = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))
    end = (start[0], rightmost(obj))
    O = fill(O, color(obj), connect(start, end))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates a canvas `O` filled with the background color of `I`, having the same dimensions.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each non-background object in `I`.
3. **Determine Line:** Finds the start and end points of the horizontal line representing the object.
4. **Draw Line:** Draws the horizontal line on the canvas using the object's color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I):
          break
        O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Initializes the output `O` as a copy of input `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each non-background object.
3. **Extend Pixels:** For each pixel in the object, extends its color horizontally until encountering another non-background color.
4. **Update Output:**  Updates the output grid `O` with the extended line. 

Each version utilizes different combinations of DSL functions and approaches the problem from a slightly different angle, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
