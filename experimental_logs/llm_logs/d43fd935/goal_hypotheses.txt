']['The transformation involves identifying the diagonal line where the red square is located in the input grid. Then, in the output grid, place a horizontal line of the same color as the red square, starting from the right edge and extending inwards towards the diagonal line. Additionally, place a vertical line of a different color, starting from the bottom edge and extending upwards towards the diagonal line. The lengths of these lines vary based on the input.', 'The output grid is filled by drawing two lines based on the position of the red square in the input grid. A horizontal line, using the same color as the red square, starts from the right edge of the output grid and moves leftwards until it aligns with the column of the red square. Simultaneously, a vertical line of a different color is drawn from the bottom edge upwards, stopping at the row of the red square.', "The transformation creates a pattern on a 10x10 output grid based on the location of the red square in the input grid. It draws a horizontal line of the same color as the red square from the right edge of the grid inwards, stopping at the column corresponding to the red square's position. A vertical line of a different color is drawn from the bottom edge upwards, ending at the row of the red square.", 'The rule involves drawing two lines on a 10x10 grid, taking cues from the position of the red square in the input grid. A horizontal line, matching the color of the red square, originates from the right edge and extends leftwards until it reaches the same column as the red square. Concurrently, a vertical line of a distinct color is drawn upwards from the bottom edge, terminating at the same row as the red square.', 'To generate the output, the transformation focuses on the diagonal containing the red square in the input. It then draws two lines on a 10x10 grid. A horizontal line, using the same color as the red square, is drawn from the right edge towards the left, stopping at the column where the red square is located. Simultaneously, a vertical line of a different color is drawn from the bottom edge upwards, ending at the row of the red square. ']
