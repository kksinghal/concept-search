## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves a combination of rotation and mirroring. 

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and then mirrored horizontally.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and then mirrored horizontally.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program `Program_to_be_generated` that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = rot90(I) 
  O = hmirror(x1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1 = rot90(I):** This line rotates the input grid `I` by 90 degrees clockwise and stores the result in `x1`.
2. **O = hmirror(x1):** This line mirrors the rotated grid `x1` horizontally and stores the final result in `O`.
3. **return O:** The transformed grid `O` is returned. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = hmirror(rot90(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **O = hmirror(rot90(I)):** This line combines the rotation and mirroring operations into a single line. The `rot90` function is applied first, followed by `hmirror`, and the final result is stored in `O`.
2. **return O:** The transformed grid `O` is returned. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = dmirror(I)
  O = rot270(x1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1 = dmirror(I):** This line mirrors the input grid `I` along the main diagonal and stores the result in `x1`.
2. **O = rot270(x1):** This line rotates the mirrored grid `x1` by 270 degrees clockwise (equivalent to 90 degrees anti-clockwise) and stores the final result in `O`.
3. **return O:** The transformed grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot270(dmirror(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **O = rot270(dmirror(I)):** This line combines diagonal mirroring and rotation into a single line. The `dmirror` function is applied first, followed by `rot270`, and the final result is stored in `O`.
2. **return O:** The transformed grid `O` is returned. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = cmirror(I)
  O = rot90(x1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1 = cmirror(I):** This line mirrors the input grid `I` along the counter-diagonal and stores the result in `x1`.
2. **O = rot90(x1):** This line rotates the mirrored grid `x1` by 90 degrees clockwise and stores the final result in `O`.
3. **return O:** The transformed grid `O` is returned.
