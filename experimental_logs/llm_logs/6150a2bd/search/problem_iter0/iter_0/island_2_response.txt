## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves rotating the entire input grid by 270 degrees counter-clockwise. 

**Example:**

Input_0:
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

Output_0:
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

Here, the input grid has been rotated 270 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. The same logic applies to Input_1 and Output_1.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the 270-degree counter-clockwise rotation:

**Version 1:** Using nested loops and direct index manipulation:

```python
def solve(grid):
  h = len(grid)
  w = len(grid[0])
  new_grid = canvas(0, (w, h))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, grid[i][j], ((w-1-j), i))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get grid dimensions:** `h` (height) and `w` (width) are determined.
2. **Create empty canvas:** `new_grid` is initialized with the rotated dimensions (w, h) and filled with 0s.
3. **Iterate and rotate:** The code iterates through the original grid. For each cell (i, j), the rotated position is calculated as ((w-1-j), i) and the cell's value is placed in the `new_grid`.

**Version 2:**  Using `rot90` function thrice:

```python
def solve(grid):
    return rot90(rot90(rot90(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `rot90` function which performs a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. Applying it thrice achieves the desired 270-degree rotation.

**Version 3:** Using `dmirror` and `hmirror` functions:

```python
def solve(grid):
  return hmirror(dmirror(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a combination of mirroring operations. `dmirror` flips the grid diagonally, and then `hmirror` flips it horizontally, resulting in a 270-degree counter-clockwise rotation.

**Version 4:** Using list comprehension and `zip`:

```python
def solve(grid):
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in zip(*grid[::-1]))[::-1]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Reverse and Transpose:** `zip(*grid[::-1])` reverses the grid (`[::-1]`) and then transposes it using `zip(*)`. This effectively rotates the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **Reverse again:**  The transposed grid is then reversed again `[::-1]` to achieve the 270-degree counter-clockwise rotation.
3. **Convert to tuple:** The result is converted back into a tuple of tuples to match the grid format.

**Version 5:**  Using `rot270` function:

```python
def solve(grid):
  return rot270(grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly employs the `rot270` function, which performs a 270-degree counter-clockwise rotation on the input grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same 270-degree counter-clockwise rotation on the input grid, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of the DSL.
