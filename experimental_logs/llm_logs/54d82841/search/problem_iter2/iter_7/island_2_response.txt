## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The transformation takes a single-color input grid and creates an output grid with four occurrences of the input object. 
* Two occurrences are upscaled versions of the input, while the other two are the original size.
* The upscaled objects are placed in the top left and bottom right corners, slightly inset.
* The original-sized objects are placed on a diagonal in the center, overlapping slightly.
* The remaining space is filled with a new color (0).
* Finally, the outer border of the output grid is removed.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The transformation identifies objects in the input grid (letters) and isolates the letter '3'.
* The '3' is duplicated and upscaled, with the copies placed in the top corners of the output grid.
* A new object with a different color (4) is created and placed in the center bottom of the output grid.
* The remaining space is filled with a new background color (0).

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* This transformation involves multiple object types (represented by different digits).
* Each object type undergoes a specific change:
    * '8': Duplicated and placed in the top corners, similar to '3' in the previous example.
    * '6': Maintains its original size and position.
    * '3': Disappears from the output.
* A new object with a different color (4) is added to the center bottom, similar to the previous example.
* The remaining space is filled with a new background color (0).


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions, each with its own logic and DSL function combinations:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = canvas(bg, (8, 8))
  
  obj_6 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 6) if any(color(obj) == 6 for obj in objs) else frozenset()
  obj_8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8) if any(color(obj) == 8 for obj in objs) else frozenset()
  obj_3 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3) if any(color(obj) == 3 for obj in objs) else frozenset()

  O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj_6, 2), (1, 1))) if len(obj_6) > 0 else O
  O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj_6, 2), (5, 5))) if len(obj_6) > 0 else O
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_8, (1, 1))) if len(obj_8) > 0 else O
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_3, (1, 1))) if len(obj_3) > 0 else O

  O = paint(O, frozenset({(4, (7, 3)), (4, (7, 7))})) 
  return trim(O) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and background:** Extract objects from the input grid (`objects`) and determine the background color (`mostcolor`).
2. **Extract specific objects:** Isolate objects with colors 6, 8, and 3 (`extract`, `colorfilter`). Handle cases where an object might not exist.
3. **Upscale and position objects:** 
    * Upscale object 6 by a factor of 2 and place copies in the top left and bottom right corners (`upscale`, `shift`).
    * Shift objects 8 and 3 to their designated positions.
4. **Add a new object:** Create a new object with color 4 and paint it at the bottom center.
5. **Final touches:** Fill the remaining space with the background color and trim the output grid's border (`trim`).


### Program Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = canvas(bg, (8, 8))
  
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 6:
      O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj, 2), (1, 1)))
      O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj, 2), (5, 5)))
    elif c in [8, 3]:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, 1)))
  
  O = paint(O, frozenset({(4, (7, 3)), (4, (7, 7))}))
  return trim(O) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object identification and canvas creation:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate and transform:** Loop through each object (`for obj in objs`):
    * If the object's color is 6, upscale and paint two copies at the designated positions.
    * If the object's color is 8 or 3, shift and paint it.
3. **Add new object and finalize:** Identical to Version 1.

This version is more concise by iterating through objects and applying transformations based on their color.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = canvas(0, (8, 8))

  six = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 6) if any(color(obj) == 6 for obj in objs) else frozenset()
  O = paint(O, shift(upscale(six, 2), (1, 1))) if len(six) > 0 else O
  O = paint(O, shift(upscale(six, 2), (5, 5))) if len(six) > 0 else O

  for c in [8, 3]:
    for obj in colorfilter(objs, c):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, 1)))

  O = paint(O, frozenset({(4, (7, 3)), (4, (7, 7))}))
  return trim(O)
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar structure to Version 2, but handles object 6 separately for clarity.
* Uses nested loops to iterate through specific color groups.


### Program Version 4:

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = canvas(0, (8, 8))

  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 6:
      O = paint(paint(O, shift(upscale(obj, 2), (1, 1))), shift(upscale(obj, 2), (5, 5)))
    elif c in [8, 3]:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, 1)))

  O = paint(O, frozenset({(4, (7, 3)), (4, (7, 7))}))
  return trim(O)
```

**Explanation:**

* This version optimizes object 6 handling by painting both upscaled copies within the same conditional branch.


### Program Version 5:

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = canvas(0, (8, 8))
  
  O = paint(O, shift(upscale(extract(colorfilter(objs, 6), lambda obj: True), 2), (1, 1)))
  O = paint(O, shift(upscale(extract(colorfilter(objs, 6), lambda obj: True), 2), (5, 5)))
  
  for c in [8, 3]:
    for obj in colorfilter(objs, c):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, 1)))
  
  O = paint(O, frozenset({(4, (7, 3)), (4, (7, 7))}))
  return trim(O)
```

**Explanation:**

* Combines object extraction and transformation for object 6 into a single line for conciseness.
* Maintains the nested loop structure from Version 3 for other objects.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version showcases a unique approach, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the DSL in solving this spatial reasoning task.
