## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:** The transformation takes the 2x3 rectangle of '6's and places it in the upper right corner of a 8x8 grid. It then adds two '4's at the bottom, spaced four cells apart. The original position of the rectangle is filled with '0's.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**  The transformation extracts the '3' shaped object and places it in the upper left corner of a 5x5 grid. A single '4' is placed in the center of the bottom row. The rest of the grid is filled with '0's.

**Input 2 - Output 2:** The transformation extracts the '8' and '6' shaped objects and places them at the top of a 5x7 grid. The '8' object is placed on the left and the '6' object on the right.  Two '4's are added to the bottom row, spaced four cells apart. The rest of the grid is filled with '0's.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation of its logic:


### Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj6 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 6), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  obj3 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 3), I)
  O = canvas(0, (8, 8))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj6, (0, 2))) if colorcount(I, 6) > 0 else O
  O = paint(O, shift(obj3, (-4, 0))) if colorcount(I, 3) > 0 else O
  O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (1, 1))) if colorcount(I, 8) > 0 else O
  O = fill(O, 4, {(7, 2), (7, 6)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extracts objects containing colors '6', '8', and '3' using `toobject` and `ofcolor`.
2. **Canvas Creation:** Creates an 8x8 canvas filled with '0's using `canvas`.
3. **Conditional Painting:** Conditionally paints the extracted objects onto the canvas using `paint` and `shift`, depending on whether the color is present in the input.
4. **Final Placement:** Adds two '4's at specific locations on the bottom row using `fill`.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj6 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 6) if colorcount(I, 6) > 0 else frozenset()
  obj8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8) if colorcount(I, 8) > 0 else frozenset()
  obj3 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3) if colorcount(I, 3) > 0 else frozenset()
  O = canvas(0, maximum((height(obj) for obj in objs)) + 2, maximum((width(obj) for obj in objs)) + 2)
  O = paint(O, shift(obj6, (0, 2)))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj3, (-4, 0))) 
  O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (1, 1)))
  O = fill(O, 4, {(height(O) - 1, 2), (height(O) - 1, width(O) - 2)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:**  Extracts all objects from the input using `objects`, then filters for specific colors using `extract` and `color`.
2. **Dynamic Canvas:** Creates a canvas dynamically sized based on the maximum height and width of extracted objects using `canvas`, `height`, and `width`.
3. **Object Placement:**  Paints the objects at specific locations on the canvas using `paint` and `shift`.
4. **Bottom Row Fill:** Adds two '4's symmetrically on the bottom row of the canvas using `fill`.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color_map = {6: (0, 2), 8: (1, 1), 3: (-4, 0)}
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, 8, 8)
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c in color_map:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, color_map[c]))
  O = fill(O, 4, {(7, 2), (7, 6)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Color Mapping:** Defines a dictionary `color_map` to store the desired offset for each object color.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Iterates through all extracted objects using a `for` loop.
3. **Color-Based Placement:** Retrieves the corresponding offset from `color_map` based on the object's color and paints it onto the canvas using `paint` and `shift`.
4. **Final Placement:**  Adds two '4's at specific locations on the bottom row using `fill`.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = canvas(0, 8, 8)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 6:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 2)))
    elif color(obj) == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-4, 0)))
    elif color(obj) == 8:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, 1)))
  O = underfill(O, 4, {(7, 2), (7, 6)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Foreground Partitioning:** Partitions the input into objects without considering the background using `fgpartition`.
2. **Iterative Painting:** Iterates through the objects and uses `if-elif` conditions to paint them at specific offsets based on their colors.
3. **Background Filling:**  Uses `underfill` to place '4's at the bottom row only if the existing color is the background color.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, valmax(objs, height) + 2, valmax(objs, width) + 2)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 6:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, 2)))
    elif color(obj) == 3:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (-4, 0)))
    elif color(obj) == 8:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (1, 1)))
  O = fill(O, 4, {(height(O) - 1, 2), (height(O) - 1, width(O) - 2)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction and Canvas:** Similar to previous versions, extracts objects and dynamically creates the canvas.
2. **Overlapping Prevention:**  Uses `cover` before each `paint` operation to ensure that previously placed objects are not overwritten.
3. **Placement and Filling:** Similar to previous versions, places objects and fills the bottom row with '4's.


These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version demonstrates different functions and logic combinations, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL in solving this task.
