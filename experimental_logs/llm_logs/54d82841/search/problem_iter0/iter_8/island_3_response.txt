## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on identifying the bottom-most points of each distinct object in the grid and placing value '4' below them in the last row. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* Two objects are identified: One formed by '6's and another by the implicit background '0's.
* The bottom-most points of these objects fall on columns 3 and 7 respectively in the last row. 
* Hence, '4' is placed in the last row at columns 3 and 7.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* Similar to Input_0, with one object of '3's and the background.
* The bottom-most point of the '3' object is on column 3 in the last row.
* '4' is placed at column 3 in the last row.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* Three distinct objects: '8's, '6's, and the background '0's.
* Bottom-most points in the last row fall on columns 3 and 7.
* '4' is placed at those columns in the last row.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_point(obj):
    return (height(I) - 1, centerofmass(obj)[1])
  bottom_points = mapply(bottom_point, objects(I, T, F, T))
  shifted_points = apply(lambda p: (p[0] + 1, p[1]), bottom_points)
  return fill(I, 4, frozenset(shifted_points))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_point(obj)` function:** This function takes an object as input and calculates the (x, y) coordinates of the point directly below its center of mass, fixed to the bottom row of the grid.
2. **`bottom_points`:** Using `mapply`, the `bottom_point` function is applied to each object identified in the input grid `I`.  This generates a set of (x, y) coordinates representing the bottom points. 
3. **`shifted_points`:** Since we want to place '4' one row below the bottom-most point, `apply` shifts each point in `bottom_points` down by one row.
4. **Final Output:**  The `fill` function takes the input grid, the value '4', and the `shifted_points` set. It places '4' at each of these calculated points on the grid, generating the final output.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_indices(obj):
    return {(len(I) - 1, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == lowermost(obj)}
  indices_to_fill = merge(mapply(bottom_indices, objects(I, T, F, T)))
  return fill(I, 4, shift(indices_to_fill, (1, 0)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_indices(obj)`:** For each object, this function identifies indices of its bottom-most cells within the input grid `I`, focusing on those sharing the same row index as the object's `lowermost` point.
2. **`indices_to_fill`:** It utilizes `mapply` to apply `bottom_indices` to each object, gathering a merged set of all bottom-most cell indices.
3. **Final Output:** `shift` moves the gathered indices one row down. Finally, `fill` places '4' at these shifted indices in the grid `I`, producing the desired output. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shifted_bottom_line(obj):
    w = width(obj)
    start = (len(I), leftmost(obj))
    return {(i + 1, j) for i, j in connect(start, (start[0], start[1] + w - 1))}
  
  lines = mapply(shifted_bottom_line, objects(I, T, F, T))
  return fill(I, 4, merge(lines))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_bottom_line(obj)`:**  This function generates a shifted horizontal line segment one row below each object. It determines the line's start point and uses `connect` to draw the segment.
2. **`lines`:** Applies `shifted_bottom_line` to each object in `I` using `mapply`, creating a collection of shifted line segments. 
3. **Final Output:** `merge` combines all line segments. Finally, `fill` uses these segments to place '4's on the grid `I`, achieving the target transformation.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def get_bottom_projection(obj):
        return frozenset((height(I), j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == lowermost(obj))

    bottom_projections = mapply(get_bottom_projection, objects(I, T, F, T))
    return fill(I, 4, merge(bottom_projections)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_bottom_projection(obj)`:** This function identifies the bottom-most cells of each object and projects them onto the row below the input grid. 
2. **`bottom_projections`:** It applies `get_bottom_projection` to all objects within the grid `I` using `mapply`, resulting in a set of projections for each object.
3. **Final Output:**  It merges all the `bottom_projections` and then uses `fill` to place '4' at each projected point on the last row of the grid `I`, producing the output.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_row_fill(obj):
    return {(height(I), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), leftmost(obj) + width(obj))}
  
  target_cells = mapply(bottom_row_fill, objects(I, T, F, T))
  return fill(I, 4, merge(target_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_row_fill(obj)`:** This function calculates the indices on the row below the grid `I` corresponding to the width and horizontal position of each input object.
2. **`target_cells`:** It utilizes `mapply` to apply `bottom_row_fill` to each object in the grid, generating a set of indices representing the cells to be filled. 
3. **Final Output:**  It merges the `target_cells` and uses the `fill` function to place the value '4' at those positions in the last row of the grid `I`. This achieves the final transformation.
