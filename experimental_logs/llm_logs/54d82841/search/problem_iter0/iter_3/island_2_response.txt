## Transformation Analysis:

The task is to identify the non-background objects in the grid and place markers below the leftmost and rightmost cells of each object on the bottom row of the grid.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '6's form two distinct objects. The markers are placed below the leftmost and rightmost '6's on the bottom row.
* **Input_1:**  There's one '3' object. Markers are placed below the leftmost and rightmost '3's on the bottom row.
* **Input_2:** Two objects exist: '8's and '6's. Markers are placed below the outermost '8's and '6's on the bottom row.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
  bottom_row = height(I) - 1
  marker_indices = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    marker_indices = marker_indices | {(bottom_row, leftmost_col), (bottom_row, rightmost_col)}
  return fill(I, 4, marker_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)` to get a set of objects (non-background connected components) in the input grid.
2. **Bottom Row:** `bottom_row = height(I) - 1` calculates the index of the bottom row.
3. **Iterate and Mark:** We iterate over each object (`obj`) and:
   - Find the leftmost (`leftmost(obj)`) and rightmost (`rightmost(obj)`) column indices.
   - Add the corresponding indices on the bottom row to the `marker_indices` set.
4. **Fill Markers:** Finally, we use `fill(I, 4, marker_indices)` to fill the cells at `marker_indices` with the value '4'.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  marker_cols = frozenset(j for j in range(w) if any(I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) for i in range(h)))
  marker_indices = frozenset((h-1, j) for j in marker_cols)
  return fill(I, 4, marker_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Dimensions:**  We obtain the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Marker Columns:** We iterate through each column (`j`) and check if any cell in that column is not the background color (`mostcommon(I)`). If a column satisfies this, its index is added to the `marker_cols` set.
3. **Create Marker Indices:** We generate the indices for placing markers by pairing each column index in `marker_cols` with the bottom row index (`h-1`).
4. **Fill Markers:** Finally, `fill(I, 4, marker_indices)` places markers ('4') at the calculated `marker_indices`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I) - 1, 0, -1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        I = fill(I, 4, {(height(I) - 1, j)})
        break 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Columns:** We iterate through each column (`j`) of the input grid `I`.
2. **Find First Non-Background Cell:** For each column, we iterate through the rows from bottom to top (`range(height(I) - 1, 0, -1)`) and check if the cell value is not the background color (`mostcommon(I)`).
3. **Place Marker:** Upon finding the first non-background cell, we place a marker ('4') on the bottom row of that column and immediately proceed to the next column using `break`.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** After processing all columns, the modified grid `I` is returned.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bottom_row = height(I) - 1
  marker_indices = frozenset()
  for j in range(width(I)):
    if any(I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) for i in range(height(I))):
      marker_indices = marker_indices | {(bottom_row, j)}
  return fill(I, 4, marker_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Bottom Row Index:**  `bottom_row = height(I) - 1` stores the bottom row's index.
2. **Iterate through Columns:** We loop through each column (`j`) of the grid `I`.
3. **Check for Non-Background:** For each column, we check if any cell in that column doesn't contain the background color (`mostcommon(I)`). 
4. **Mark Bottom Cell:** If a non-background cell is found in a column, its corresponding bottom row index is added to `marker_indices`.
5. **Fill Markers:** Finally,  `fill(I, 4, marker_indices)` places '4' at all identified `marker_indices`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 4, frozenset((height(I) - 1, j) for j in range(width(I)) if any(row[j] != mostcommon(I) for row in I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **One-liner:** This solution uses a single line of code to achieve the transformation.
2. **Generate Marker Indices:** We create a set of indices using a set comprehension:
   - It iterates through each column index (`j`).
   - For each column, it checks if any row (`row`) has a non-background color (`mostcommon(I)`) at that column index.
   - If true, it includes the index `(height(I) - 1, j)` (bottom row, current column) in the set.
3. **Fill Markers:**  Finally, `fill(I, 4, ...)` places the markers (`4`) at the generated indices on the bottom row. 

##  Note:

These five versions use different approaches and combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the versatility and flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version achieves the same desired transformation, highlighting the diverse ways to solve a problem within a given language constraint.
