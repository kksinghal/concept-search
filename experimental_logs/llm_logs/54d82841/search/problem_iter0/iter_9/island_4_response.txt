## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the topmost object in the grid (excluding the background color 0) and placing two '4's symmetrically at the bottom row of the grid, aligned with the object's left and right edges. 

**Example:**

* **Input_0:** The topmost object consists of '6's. The leftmost '6' is in column 1 and the rightmost in column 4.  The '4's are placed in the bottom row at columns 1 and 6, maintaining symmetry with the object's edges.

* **Input_1 & Input_2:**  The logic remains consistent, focusing on the topmost non-zero object and aligning the '4's in the bottom row.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def fhdddeecfidcefaeifdgbaddieeacibe(I):
  # Get the indices of the topmost object
  obj_indices = toindices(first(objects(I, T, F, T)))

  # Find the leftmost and rightmost column indices of the object
  left_j = minimum(apply(lambda x: x[1], obj_indices))
  right_j = maximum(apply(lambda x: x[1], obj_indices))

  # Calculate the column indices for the '4's
  new_left_j = left_j
  new_right_j = right_j + (len(I[0]) - right_j - 1) - (left_j - 0) 

  # Construct the new object with '4's
  new_obj = recolor(4, {(len(I) - 1, new_left_j), (len(I) - 1, new_right_j)})

  # Paint the new object onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Topmost Object:** Similar to Program A, it identifies the topmost object and extracts its indices.
2. **Calculate Left & Right Edges:**  It finds the minimum and maximum column indices (j) from the object indices to determine its left and right edges.
3. **Calculate '4' Positions:** It leverages symmetry to calculate the right '4' position based on the left edge and grid width.
4. **Create & Paint New Object:**  Creates a new object with '4's at the calculated positions and paints it onto the input grid. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def fhdddeecfidcefaeifdgbaddieeacibe(I):
  # Find the bounding box of the topmost object
  obj_box = box(first(objects(I, T, F, T)))

  # Get the leftmost and rightmost corner indices
  left_corner = ulcorner(obj_box)
  right_corner = urcorner(obj_box)

  # Extract the column indices
  left_j = left_corner[1]
  right_j = right_corner[1]

  # Calculate the column indices for the '4's on the bottom row
  new_left_j = left_j
  new_right_j = right_j + (len(I[0]) - right_j - 1) - (left_j - 0)

  # Construct the new object with '4's
  new_obj = recolor(4, {(len(I) - 1, new_left_j), (len(I) - 1, new_right_j)})

  # Paint the new object onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Bounding Box:** This version utilizes the `box` function to directly get the bounding box indices of the topmost object.
2. **Corner Extraction & '4' Positions:** It extracts corner indices to determine left and right edges and applies the same symmetry logic as Version 1 to calculate '4' positions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def fhdddeecfidcefaeifdgbaddieeacibe(I):
  # Find the topmost object in the grid
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))

  # Create a function to map column indices to the bottom row
  map_to_bottom = lambda j: (len(I) - 1, j)

  # Get the leftmost and rightmost column indices of the object
  left_j = minimum(apply(lambda x: x[1], toindices(obj)))
  right_j = maximum(apply(lambda x: x[1], toindices(obj)))

  # Construct the new object with '4's at the mapped positions
  new_obj = recolor(4, {map_to_bottom(left_j), map_to_bottom(right_j)})

  # Paint the new object onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mapping Function:** This version introduces a `map_to_bottom` function for clarity, directly mapping column indices to the bottom row.
2. **Edge Calculation & Painting:**  It calculates edges similarly to Version 1 and utilizes the mapping function for concise '4' placement.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def fhdddeecfidcefaeifdgbaddieeacibe(I):
  # Find the topmost object
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))

  # Get the width of the object
  obj_width = width(obj)

  # Calculate the center column index of the object
  center_j = leftmost(obj) + obj_width // 2 

  # Calculate positions for the '4's on the bottom row
  left_4_j = center_j - obj_width // 2
  right_4_j = left_4_j + obj_width - 1

  # Construct the new object with '4's
  new_obj = recolor(4, {(len(I) - 1, left_4_j), (len(I) - 1, right_4_j)})

  # Paint the new object onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Center Calculation:** It calculates the center column of the topmost object.
2. **Symmetric '4' Placement:**  It leverages the object's width and center to directly calculate symmetrical '4' positions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def fhdddeecfidcefaeifdgbaddieeacibe(I):
  # Directly find the indices of the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in the top row
  left_j = next((j for j, v in enumerate(I[0]) if v != 0), len(I[0]))
  right_j = len(I[0]) - next((j for j, v in enumerate(I[0][::-1]) if v != 0), 0) - 1

  # Calculate the column indices for the '4's on the bottom row
  new_left_j = left_j
  new_right_j = right_j + (len(I[0]) - right_j - 1) - (left_j - 0)

  # Construct the new object with '4's
  new_obj = recolor(4, {(len(I) - 1, new_left_j), (len(I) - 1, new_right_j)})

  # Paint the new object onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Edge Finding:** Inspired by Program B, this version directly finds the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in the top row, simplifying the process.
2. **'4' Placement and Painting:** The rest of the logic remains similar, calculating '4' positions based on symmetry and painting the new object.
