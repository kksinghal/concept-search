## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the bottom row of the grid and aims to mark specific columns with the digit '4'. These columns are determined by the presence of objects extending from the top row to the bottom row. 

* **Example 1:** The input grid has two objects (digit '6') extending vertically. The output grid marks the bottom row columns where these objects end with '4'.
* **Example 2:** The input grid has one object (digit '3') extending vertically. The output grid marks the corresponding column in the bottom row with '4'.
* **Example 3:** The input grid has two objects (digits '8' and '6') extending vertically.  The output grid marks the corresponding columns in the bottom row with '4'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  target_cols = frozenset(j for obj in objs for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == 0 and any(k == height(I) - 1 for k, l in toindices(obj)))
  target_indices = frozenset((height(I)-1, j) for j in target_cols)
  return fill(I, 4, target_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2.  **Find Target Columns:** The code iterates through each object and its indices. It checks if the object has cells in both the top row (`i == 0`) and the bottom row (`k == height(I) - 1`). If true, the column index (`j`) is added to `target_cols`.
3.  **Mark Bottom Row:** The code generates indices for the bottom row cells within the `target_cols` and uses `fill` to change their values to '4'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  marked_grid = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != 0 and i == 0:
        if any(I[k][j] != 0 for k in range(i+1, height(I))):
          marked_grid = fill(marked_grid, 4, {(height(I) - 1, j)})
  return marked_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Columns:**  The program iterates through each column (`j`) of the input grid.
2. **Check Top Row:** For each column, it checks if the top row cell is not background (`I[i][j] != 0`).
3. **Verify Vertical Extension:** If the top row cell is part of an object, it checks if the object extends to the bottom row using `any(I[k][j] != 0 for k in range(i+1, height(I)))`.
4. **Mark Bottom Cell:**  If an object extends from top to bottom in a column, the bottom row cell of that column is marked with '4'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  target_indices = set()
  for j in range(w):
    current_color = None
    for i in range(h):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        if i == 0:
          current_color = I[i][j]
        elif i == h - 1 and current_color is not None:
          target_indices.add((i, j))
  return fill(I, 4, frozenset(target_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Track:**  Iterates through each column, tracking if a non-background color is found in the top row (`current_color`).
2. **Mark if Continuous:** If a non-background color started from the top row and continues to the bottom row, the bottom row cell is marked for filling.
3. **Fill Marked Cells:** Finally, all marked cells are filled with '4'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bottom_row = {(height(I) - 1, j) for j in range(width(I))}
    obj_endpoints = mapply(lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))
    target_cols = {j for i, j in obj_endpoints if i == 0 and any(k == height(I) - 1 for k, l in obj_endpoints and l == j)}
    return fill(I, 4, {(height(I)-1, j) for j in target_cols} & bottom_row)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Bottom Row:** `bottom_row` stores indices of the bottom row.
2. **Find Object Endpoints:** `obj_endpoints` stores the top-left corner indices of each object in the grid.
3. **Identify Target Columns:** The code finds columns where an object starts at the top (`i == 0`) and another object with the same column index (`l == j`) ends at the bottom (`k == height(I) - 1`).
4. **Mark Cells:** The program marks the intersection of `target_cols` and `bottom_row` with '4'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  output_grid = I
  for j in range(w):
    if I[0][j] != 0:
      for i in range(1, h):
        if I[i][j] != 0:
          if i == h - 1:
            output_grid = fill(output_grid, 4, {(h - 1, j)})
          break
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** It iterates through columns, checking if the top cell is part of an object.
2. **Find Object Bottom:** If yes, it finds the bottom cell of that object in the column.
3. **Mark if Bottom Row:** If the object's bottom cell is in the last row, it marks that position for filling.
4. **Fill Marked Cells:** In the end, it fills all marked positions with '4'.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation while using the provided DSL functions. Each version offers a unique combination of logic and function calls, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for this task.
