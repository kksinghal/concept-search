## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost non-zero element in each row of the input grid and placing a '4' one row below and one column to the right of that element in the output grid. The original input grid remains unchanged in the output.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 3 3 3 0
0 3 0 3 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Output:

```
0 3 3 3 0
0 3 0 3 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0
```

Here, the rightmost non-zero elements are (0,3), (1,3) and placing '4' one row below and one column to the right results in (4,4).


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def iebebffabjcheabfbibfbceegibhcajc(I):
  # Find indices of all non-zero elements.
  nz_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] != 0)
  # Find the rightmost index for each row
  rightmost_indices = frozenset(valmax(sfilter(nz_indices, lambda x: x[0] == row), lambda x: x[1]) for row in range(height(I)))
  # Shift the indices down and right.
  shifted_indices = shift(rightmost_indices, (1, 1))
  # Create the output by filling '4's at the shifted indices.
  O = fill(canvas(0, (height(I) + 1, width(I))), 4, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Non-zero Indices:**  We first identify the indices of all non-zero elements in the input grid using `nz_indices`.
2. **Find Rightmost Indices:** For each row, we filter the `nz_indices` to only include indices from that row and then use `valmax` with a custom function to find the index with the maximum column value (rightmost) in that row.
3. **Shift and Fill:** These rightmost indices are then shifted down and right by one unit using `shift`. Finally, a canvas of appropriate size is created using `canvas` and filled with '4' at the shifted indices using `fill`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def iebebffabjcheabfbibfbceegibhcajc(I):
  O = canvas(0, (height(I) + 1, width(I)))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        O = fill(O, 4, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Fill:** This version iterates through each row of the input grid from the last column to the first. Upon encountering a non-zero element, it fills a '4' in the output grid at the position one row below and one column to the right and breaks the inner loop to move to the next row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def iebebffabjcheabfbibfbceegibhcajc(I):
  # Find the rightmost non-zero element in each row
  rightmost_elements = mapply(lambda row: argmax(enumerate(row), lambda x: x[1] if x[1] != 0 else -1)[0], I)
  # Create indices from these elements, shifted down and right
  shifted_indices = frozenset((i + 1, j + 1) for i, j in enumerate(rightmost_elements))
  # Create the output by filling '4's at the shifted indices.
  O = fill(canvas(0, (height(I) + 1, width(I))), 4, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Rightmost Element:** We iterate through each row and use `argmax` with a custom function to find the index of the rightmost non-zero element.
2. **Shift Indices:** We shift the obtained indices one row down and one column right.
3. **Fill Canvas:**  Finally, we create a canvas and fill '4' at the shifted indices.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def iebebffabjcheabfbibfbceegibhcajc(I):
  shifted_indices = frozenset()
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        shifted_indices = insert((i + 1, j + 1), shifted_indices)
        break
  O = fill(canvas(0, (height(I) + 1, width(I))), 4, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Collect Indices:** This version directly iterates through the input grid and collects the shifted indices of the rightmost non-zero elements in each row.
2. **Fill Canvas:** Finally, a canvas is filled with '4' at the collected indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def iebebffabjcheabfbibfbceegibhcajc(I):
  # Transpose the grid, reverse each row, find the first non-zero element's index,
  # transpose back, shift down, then fill.
  transposed = dmirror(I)
  reversed_rows = tuple(row[::-1] for row in transposed)
  first_nonzero_indices = frozenset((j, i) for i, row in enumerate(reversed_rows) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val != 0)
  shifted_indices = shift(first_nonzero_indices, (1, 0))
  O = fill(canvas(0, (height(I) + 1, width(I))), 4, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose and Reverse:** We first transpose the grid and reverse each row. This brings the rightmost non-zero elements to the beginning of each row.
2. **Find First Non-zero Index:** We find the index of the first non-zero element in each row, which represents the original rightmost non-zero element.
3. **Shift and Fill:** We then transpose back to the original orientation, shift the indices down and right, and finally fill '4' at these shifted indices on a canvas.
