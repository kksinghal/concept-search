## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies the leftmost and rightmost points on the bottom row of each distinct object in the input grid (excluding the background). It then replaces the color of these points with the value '4'. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The bottom row of the '6' objects has two extreme points on each side. These points are replaced by '4' in the output.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the bottom row of the '3' object has two extreme points replaced by '4'.
* **Input_2:** Both the '8' and '6' objects have their leftmost and rightmost points on the bottom row changed to '4'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid) - 1
  def extreme_points(obj):
    bottom_points = frozenset((i,j) for i,j in toindices(obj) if i == h)
    if bottom_points:
      return frozenset({(h, leftmost(bottom_points)), (h, rightmost(bottom_points))})
    return frozenset()
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(extreme_points, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid) - 1`**: Get the row index of the bottom row.
2. **`extreme_points(obj)` function:**
    - Finds the indices of the bottom row points belonging to the object (`bottom_points`).
    - If `bottom_points` is not empty:
        - Finds the leftmost and rightmost column indices within `bottom_points`.
        - Returns a frozenset containing the coordinates of these extreme points.
    - If `bottom_points` is empty, returns an empty frozenset.
3. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`**:  Gets all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
4. **`apply(extreme_points, objects(grid, T, F, T))`**: Applies the `extreme_points` function to each object, getting a container of frozensets, each containing the extreme points of an object.
5. **`merge(...)`**: Merges all the frozensets into a single frozenset containing all extreme points.
6. **`paint(grid, ...)`**: Paints the extreme points on the original grid with the color '4'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid) - 1
  def mark_bottom(obj):
    bottom_points = frozenset((h, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == h)
    return bottom_points
  bottom_points = merge(apply(mark_bottom, objects(grid, T, F, T)))
  if bottom_points:
    return paint(grid, frozenset(((4, (h, leftmost(bottom_points))), (4, (h, rightmost(bottom_points))))))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Similar to Version 1, we get the bottom row index (`h`).
2. **`mark_bottom(obj)` function:**
    - Directly constructs a frozenset of bottom row point coordinates belonging to the object.
3. We apply `mark_bottom` to all objects and merge the results into `bottom_points`.
4. If `bottom_points` is not empty:
   -  We directly construct a frozenset containing the extreme points with color '4'.
   -  The grid is painted with these points.
5. If `bottom_points` is empty, the original grid is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid) - 1
  bottom_row = frozenset((i,j) for i,j in asindices(grid) if i == h)
  def process_object(obj):
    obj_bottom = bottom_row & toindices(obj)
    if obj_bottom:
        return frozenset({(h, leftmost(obj_bottom)), (h, rightmost(obj_bottom))})
    return frozenset()
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(process_object, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. We get the bottom row index (`h`).
2. **`bottom_row`**: Pre-compute a set of all indices on the bottom row.
3. **`process_object(obj)` function:**
    - Calculates the intersection (`obj_bottom`) between the bottom row and the object's indices.
    - If `obj_bottom` is not empty:
        -  Finds leftmost and rightmost points within `obj_bottom`.
        -  Returns a frozenset with their coordinates.
    - If `obj_bottom` is empty, returns an empty frozenset.
4. We apply `process_object` to all objects, merge the resulting frozensets, and paint the extreme points on the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    h = height(grid) - 1
    def extreme_points(obj):
        bottom_points = tuple(j for i,j in toindices(obj) if i == h)
        if bottom_points:
          return frozenset({(h, min(bottom_points)), (h, max(bottom_points))})
        return frozenset()
    return paint(grid, merge(apply(extreme_points, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Get the index of the bottom row (`h`).
2. **`extreme_points(obj)` function:**
    - Extracts the column indices (`j`) of the points on the bottom row belonging to the object (`bottom_points`).
    - If `bottom_points` is not empty:
        - Finds the minimum and maximum column index representing the extreme points.
        - Returns a frozenset containing the coordinates of these points.
    - If `bottom_points` is empty, returns an empty frozenset.
3. Applies `extreme_points` to all objects, merges the resulting frozensets, and paints the extreme points onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    h = height(grid) - 1
    def get_extreme_cols(obj):
        bottom_indices = ((i,j) for i,j in toindices(obj) if i == h)
        leftmost_j = min(bottom_indices, key=lambda x: x[1], default=None)
        rightmost_j = max(bottom_indices, key=lambda x: x[1], default=None)
        return frozenset({(h, leftmost_j[1])} if leftmost_j else set()) | frozenset({(h, rightmost_j[1])} if rightmost_j else set())
    
    return paint(grid, merge(apply(get_extreme_cols, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Determine the index of the bottom row (`h`).
2. **`get_extreme_cols(obj)` function:**
    - Identifies the indices of the bottom row points belonging to the object (`bottom_indices`).
    - Uses `min` and `max` with a lambda function to find the indices with the minimum and maximum column values (`leftmost_j` and `rightmost_j`), respectively.
    - Constructs a frozenset containing the coordinates of the extreme points if they exist.
3. Applies `get_extreme_cols` to all objects, merges the resulting frozensets, and paints the extreme points on the grid.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each utilizes distinct logic and function combinations while fulfilling the requirements of the task.
