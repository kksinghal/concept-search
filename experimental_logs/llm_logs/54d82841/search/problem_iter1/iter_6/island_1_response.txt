## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the leftmost and rightmost points of each distinct object (excluding the background color) on the last row of the grid. Then, it marks these extreme points with the value '4'. 

**Example:**

Let's take Input_0:

```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

The last row has two distinct objects (with value '6'). The leftmost and rightmost points of these objects are (7, 2) and (7, 3) for the first object and (7, 6) and (7, 7) for the second object.  The transformation marks these points with the value '4', resulting in Output_0:

```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid) - 1
  def mark_extremes(obj):
    return frozenset({(h, leftmost(obj)), (h, rightmost(obj))})
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(mark_extremes, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid) - 1`**: Gets the index of the last row.
2. **`mark_extremes(obj)`**: Defines a function that takes an object and returns a set containing the leftmost and rightmost indices on the last row (`h`). 
3. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`**: Extracts all objects (excluding background) from the grid.
4. **`apply(mark_extremes, ...)`**: Applies the `mark_extremes` function to each object.
5. **`merge(...)`**: Merges the resulting sets of indices.
6. **`paint(grid, frozenset((4, p) for p in ...))`**:  Paints the value '4' at all identified indices on the grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid) - 1
  last_row_objects = sfilter(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: lowermost(obj) == h)
  extremes = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset({(h, leftmost(obj)), (h, rightmost(obj))}), last_row_objects)
  return paint(grid, extremes)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid) - 1`**: Gets the index of the last row.
2. **`last_row_objects = ...`**: Filters objects to keep only those whose lowermost point is on the last row.
3. **`extremes = ...`**: Maps a lambda function to each object in `last_row_objects`. The lambda function identifies and returns a set of the leftmost and rightmost points on the last row for each object.
4. **`paint(grid, extremes)`**:  Paints the value '4' at all identified indices on the grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid) - 1
  def process_object(obj):
    if lowermost(obj) == h:
      return frozenset({(h, leftmost(obj)), (h, rightmost(obj))})
    return frozenset()
  extremes = merge(apply(process_object, objects(grid, T, F, T)))
  return paint(grid, extremes)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid) - 1`**: Gets the index of the last row.
2. **`process_object(obj)`**: Defines a function that checks if an object's lowermost point is on the last row. If yes, it returns a set containing the leftmost and rightmost points; otherwise, an empty set.
3. **`extremes = ...`**: Applies the `process_object` function to each object and merges the results.
4. **`paint(grid, extremes)`**: Paints the value '4' at all identified indices on the grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid) - 1
  extremes = frozenset()
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    if lowermost(obj) == h:
      extremes = extremes | frozenset({(h, leftmost(obj)), (h, rightmost(obj))})
  return paint(grid, extremes)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid) - 1`**: Gets the index of the last row.
2. **`extremes = frozenset()`**: Initializes an empty set to store extreme points.
3. **`for obj in ...`**: Iterates through each object (excluding background) in the grid.
4. **`if lowermost(obj) == h:`**: If the object's lowermost point is on the last row, adds its leftmost and rightmost points to the `extremes` set.
5. **`return paint(grid, extremes)`**:  Paints the value '4' at all identified indices on the grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
    last_row_indices = frozenset((height(grid)-1, j) for j in range(width(grid)))
    object_indices = merge(apply(toindices, objects(grid, T, F, T)))
    intersecting_indices = intersection(last_row_indices, object_indices)
    extreme_indices = mapply(lambda idx: frozenset({(height(grid)-1, leftmost(intersecting_indices)), 
                                                (height(grid)-1, rightmost(intersecting_indices))}), 
                              intersecting_indices)
    return paint(grid, extreme_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`last_row_indices = ...`**: Generates a set of all indices on the last row of the grid.
2. **`object_indices = ...`**: Gets the indices of all objects in the grid.
3. **`intersecting_indices = ...`**: Finds the intersection of indices present on both the last row and within any object.
4. **`extreme_indices = ...`**:  Maps a lambda function to each index in `intersecting_indices`. The lambda function determines the leftmost and rightmost indices within `intersecting_indices` and returns them as a set. 
5. **`return paint(grid, extreme_indices)`**: Paints the value '4' at all identified extreme indices on the grid.
