## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies the outermost columns of each unique object (excluding the background color) in the input grid and places the digit '4' at the bottom row of these columns. 

**Input_0:** 
- Two objects: '6' and another '6'.
- Outermost columns of first '6': 1 and 4.
- Outermost columns of second '6': 6 and 8.
- '4' is placed at positions (7,1), (7,4), (7,6), and (7,8).

**Input_1:**
- One object: '3'.
- Outermost columns of '3': 1 and 4.
- '4' is placed at positions (4,1) and (4,4).

**Input_2:**
- Three objects: '8', '6', and another '6'.
- Outermost columns of '8': 1 and 4.
- Outermost columns of first '6': 5 and 7.
- Outermost columns of second '6': 5 and 7.
- '4' is placed at positions (4,1), (4,4), (4,5), and (4,7).

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj), 4), (h-1, rightmost(obj), 4)}, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`h = height(grid)`**: Stores the height of the grid.
2. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`**: Extracts all objects (excluding background) from the grid.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj), 4), (h-1, rightmost(obj), 4)}, ...)`**: For each object:
    - `(h-1, leftmost(obj), 4)`: Creates a tuple representing the bottom-left corner of the object with value 4.
    - `(h-1, rightmost(obj), 4)`: Creates a tuple representing the bottom-right corner of the object with value 4.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Combines all generated tuples into a single set.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`**: Paints the specified cells in the grid with value 4.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  return paint(grid, mapply(lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj)), (h-1, rightmost(obj))}, objects(grid, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`h = height(grid)`**: Stores the height of the grid.
2. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`**: Extracts all objects (excluding background) from the grid.
3. **`mapply(lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj)), (h-1, rightmost(obj))}, ...)`**: For each object:
    - `{(h-1, leftmost(obj)), (h-1, rightmost(obj))}`: Creates a set containing the bottom-left and bottom-right corner indices of the object.
4. **`paint(grid, ...)`**: Paints the specified cells in the grid with value 4.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  f = lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj)), (h-1, rightmost(obj))}
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(compose(lbind(fill, 4), f), objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`h = height(grid)`**: Stores the height of the grid.
2. **`f = lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj)), (h-1, rightmost(obj))}`**: Defines a function `f` that returns a set containing the bottom-left and bottom-right corner indices of an object.
3. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`**: Extracts all objects (excluding background) from the grid.
4. **`compose(lbind(fill, 4), f)`**: Creates a composed function:
    - `lbind(fill, 4)`: Creates a partially applied function `fill` with the first argument fixed to 4 (the color to fill).
    - The composed function takes an object, applies `f` to get its corner indices, and then uses the partially applied `fill` function to fill those indices with 4.
5. **`apply(..., objects(grid, T, F, T))`**: Applies the composed function to each object in the grid.
6. **`merge(...)`**: Combines all the filled cells into a single set.
7. **`paint(grid, ...)`**: Paints the specified cells in the grid with the corresponding color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(h - 1, leftmost(obj)), (h - 1, rightmost(obj))}, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid)`:** Stores the height of the grid.
2. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj)), (h-1, rightmost(obj))}, ...)`:** This part iterates through each extracted object and applies a lambda function to it. The lambda function does the following for each object:
    - **`(h-1, leftmost(obj))`:**  Creates a tuple representing the index of the bottom-left corner of the object.
    - **`(h-1, rightmost(obj))`:** Creates a tuple representing the index of the bottom-right corner of the object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all the sets of indices generated in the previous step into a single set. 
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** Finally, this function takes the original grid and the set of indices. It fills the cells at those indices with the value 4.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  def mark_corners(obj):
    return {(h - 1, leftmost(obj)), (h - 1, rightmost(obj))}
  corner_indices = mapply(mark_corners, objects(grid, T, F, T))
  return paint(grid, corner_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid)`:** Stores the height of the grid for later use.
2. **`def mark_corners(obj): ...`:** This defines a function `mark_corners` that takes an object as input and returns a set containing the bottom-left and bottom-right corner indices of that object. 
3. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all the objects (excluding the background) present in the input grid.
4. **`corner_indices = mapply(mark_corners, ...)`:** This applies the `mark_corners` function to each of the extracted objects using `mapply` and then merges the results into a single set called `corner_indices`. 
5. **`return paint(grid, corner_indices)`:** This final step uses the `paint` function to modify the original grid by placing the digit '4' at all the corner indices stored in `corner_indices`.

These program versions utilize various DSL functions like `apply`, `mapply`, `compose`, and `lbind` to achieve the same transformation in different ways, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
