## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the leftmost and rightmost points of each object on the bottom row of the input grid. Then, it places a "4" at those locations on the bottom row of the output grid.

**Input_0:**

* Two objects are detected on the bottom row: one with '6's and one with '0's (background).
* Leftmost and rightmost '6' positions: (7,1) and (7,3).
* Leftmost and rightmost '0' positions: (7,0) and (7,7). 
* Output places '4' at these locations.

**Input_1:**

* One object is detected on the bottom row: composed of '3's.
* Leftmost and rightmost '3' positions: (4,1) and (4,3).
* Output places '4' at these locations.

**Input_2:**

* Two objects are detected on the bottom row: one with '8's and one with '6's.
* Leftmost and rightmost '8' positions: (4,1) and (4,3).
* Leftmost and rightmost '6' positions: (4,5) and (4,6).
* Output places '4' at these locations.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid) - 1
  def extreme_points(obj):
    bottom_points = frozenset((i,j) for i,j in toindices(obj) if i == h)
    return {(h, leftmost(bottom_points)), (h, rightmost(bottom_points))}
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(extreme_points, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid) - 1`**:  Gets the row index of the bottom row.
2. **`extreme_points(obj)`**:  
    * `bottom_points`: Filters the object's indices to include only those on the bottom row.
    * Returns a set containing the leftmost and rightmost points of the `bottom_points`.
3. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`**: Extracts all foreground objects from the grid.
4. **`apply(extreme_points, ...)`**: Applies `extreme_points` to each object, getting leftmost and rightmost bottom points.
5. **`merge(...)`**: Combines the results from all objects into a single set of points.
6. **`paint(grid, frozenset((4, p) for p in ...))`**: Paints '4' at each identified point on the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid) - 1
  def mark_bottom(obj):
    return frozenset({(h, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == h})
  bottom_points = merge(apply(mark_bottom, objects(grid, T, F, T)))
  return paint(grid, frozenset((4, (h, leftmost(bottom_points))), (4, (h, rightmost(bottom_points)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid) - 1`**:  Gets the row index of the bottom row.
2. **`mark_bottom(obj)`**: Returns indices of cells belonging to the object on the bottom row.
3. **`bottom_points = ...`**: Extracts all points on the bottom row belonging to any foreground object.
4. **`paint(grid, ...)`**: Paints '4' at the leftmost and rightmost points of `bottom_points` on the bottom row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    h = height(grid) - 1
    bottom_row = {(i,j) for i,j in asindices(grid) if i == h}
    def process_object(obj):
        obj_bottom = bottom_row & toindices(obj)
        if obj_bottom:
            return {(h, leftmost(obj_bottom)), (h, rightmost(obj_bottom))}
        return set()
    return paint(grid, merge(apply(process_object, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid) - 1`**:  Gets the row index of the bottom row.
2. **`bottom_row = ...`**:  Gets the indices of all cells in the bottom row.
3. **`process_object(obj)`**: 
    * `obj_bottom`: Finds the intersection of the object's indices with the bottom row.
    * If `obj_bottom` is not empty, it calculates and returns the leftmost and rightmost points.
    * Otherwise, returns an empty set.
4. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`**: Extracts all foreground objects.
5. **`apply(process_object, ...)`**: Applies `process_object` to each object.
6. **`merge(...)`**: Combines all identified leftmost and rightmost points.
7. **`paint(grid, ...)`**:  Paints '4' at each identified point on the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    h = height(grid) - 1
    def extreme_points(obj):
        bottom_points = [(j) for i,j in toindices(obj) if i == h]
        if bottom_points:
          return {(h, min(bottom_points)), (h, max(bottom_points))}
        return set()
    return paint(grid, merge(apply(extreme_points, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid) - 1`**:  Gets the row index of the bottom row.
2. **`extreme_points(obj)`**:
    *  `bottom_points`: Extracts column indices of object cells on the bottom row.
    *  If `bottom_points` is not empty, returns the leftmost and rightmost points; otherwise, an empty set.
3. **`apply(extreme_points, objects(grid, T, F, T))`**: Applies `extreme_points` to all foreground objects.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Combines the identified extreme points from all objects.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`**:  Paints '4' at each identified point on the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid) - 1
  def mark_extremes(obj):
    bottom_indices = sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda p: p[0] == h)
    if bottom_indices:
      return frozenset({(h, j) for i, j in bottom_indices if j == leftmost(bottom_indices) or j == rightmost(bottom_indices)})
    return frozenset()
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(mark_extremes, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid) - 1`**: Gets the bottom row index.
2. **`mark_extremes(obj)`**: 
    * `bottom_indices`: Filters the object's indices, keeping only those on the bottom row.
    * If `bottom_indices` is not empty:
       * It creates a new frozenset containing the leftmost and rightmost points on the bottom row.
    * Otherwise, returns an empty frozenset.
3. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`**: Extracts all foreground objects.
4. **`apply(mark_extremes, ...)`**: Applies `mark_extremes` to each object.
5. **`merge(...)`**: Combines the results from all objects.
6. **`paint(grid, ...)`**: Paints '4' on the grid at the identified extreme points.


These five versions demonstrate distinct logic and DSL function combinations while achieving the same desired transformation. Each version utilizes a different approach to identifying and marking the leftmost and rightmost points of objects on the bottom row of the input grid.
