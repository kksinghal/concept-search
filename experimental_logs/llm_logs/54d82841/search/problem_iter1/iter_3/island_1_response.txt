## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the leftmost and rightmost columns of each non-background object in the input grid and placing the digit '4' at the bottom row of these columns. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The objects are formed by digits '6'.  The leftmost and rightmost '6' in the top object are in columns 1 and 3 respectively. Similarly, for the bottom object, the leftmost and rightmost '6' are in columns 5 and 7. Hence, in the output, '4' is placed at the bottom row in columns 1, 3, 5, and 7. 
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, '4' is placed at the bottom row in columns 1 and 3, corresponding to the leftmost and rightmost positions of the object formed by digit '3'.
* **Input_2:** The transformation is applied to both objects ('8' and '6') independently, placing '4' at the bottom row in columns 1, 3 (for '8') and 5, 7 (for '6').

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj), 4), (h-1, rightmost(obj), 4)}, objects(grid, T, F, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid)`:**  Gets the height of the input grid.
2. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts all non-background objects from the grid, considering them as univalued and not allowing diagonals.
3. **`lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj), 4), (h-1, rightmost(obj), 4)}`:**  For each object, this lambda function creates a set containing two tuples. Each tuple represents the coordinates and color (4) for the leftmost and rightmost points of the object at the bottom row of the grid. 
4. **`apply(..., objects(grid, T, F, T))`:** Applies the lambda function to every object extracted from the grid.
5. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the sets of coordinates generated for each object into a single set.
6. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** Paints the digit '4' onto the input grid at the coordinates specified in the merged set.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  def mark_corners(obj):
    return {(h - 1, leftmost(obj), 4), (h - 1, rightmost(obj), 4)}
  corner_indices = mapply(mark_corners, objects(grid, T, F, T))
  return paint(grid, corner_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid)`:** Gets the height of the input grid.
2. **`mark_corners(obj)`:**  Defines a function that takes an object and returns a set of tuples containing coordinates and color (4) for its leftmost and rightmost points at the bottom row.
3. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts all non-background objects from the grid.
4. **`mapply(mark_corners, ...)`:**  Applies the `mark_corners` function to each object and merges the results into a single set.
5. **`paint(grid, corner_indices)`:** Paints the digit '4' onto the input grid at the calculated corner indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  f = lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj), 4), (h-1, rightmost(obj), 4)}
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(f, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid)`:**  Gets the height of the input grid.
2. **`f = lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj), 4), (h-1, rightmost(obj), 4)}`:** Defines a lambda function `f` similar to `mark_corners` in Version 2.
3. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts all non-background objects.
4. **`apply(f, ...)`:** Applies the lambda function `f` to each object.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the results into a single set of coordinates.
6. **`paint(grid, ...)`:**  Paints the '4's onto the grid at the identified locations.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  def get_corner_indices(obj):
    return ((h-1, leftmost(obj)), (h-1, rightmost(obj)))
  corner_indices =  set(merge(apply(get_corner_indices, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
  return paint(fill(grid, 4, corner_indices), corner_indices, 4)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid)`:** Gets the height of the input grid.
2. **`get_corner_indices(obj)`:**  A function to get the coordinates of the leftmost and rightmost points at the bottom row for a given object.
3. **`corner_indices =  set(merge(apply(get_corner_indices, objects(grid, T, F, T))))`:**  Applies `get_corner_indices` to all non-background objects, merges the result, and converts it into a set.
4. **`paint(fill(grid, 4, corner_indices), corner_indices, 4)`:** Fills the `corner_indices` with '4' on the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  return paint(grid, merge([{(h - 1, leftmost(obj), 4), (h - 1, rightmost(obj), 4)} for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T)]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(grid)`:**  Gets the height of the input grid.
2. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts all non-background objects.
3. **`[{(h - 1, leftmost(obj), 4), (h - 1, rightmost(obj), 4)} for obj in ...]`:** Uses list comprehension to create a list of sets, where each set contains the coordinates and color for the corners of an object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the list of sets into a single set of coordinates.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:**  Paints the '4's onto the grid at the specified coordinates.

These versions utilize different approaches like lambda functions, separate functions, list comprehension, and set manipulation, demonstrating diverse ways to achieve the same transformation.
