## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the leftmost and rightmost non-background cells in the bottom row of each distinct object and place the digit '4' one row below these cells. The original objects remain unchanged.

**Input_0:**
- Two objects are detected: one with '6's and one with '0's (background).
- For the '6' object, the leftmost and rightmost '6's in the bottom row are at positions (3,5) and (3,7). 
- '4's are placed at (4,5) and (4,7) in the output.

**Input_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, '4's are placed below the leftmost and rightmost '3's of the bottom row.

**Input_2:**
- Two non-background objects are present: '8's and '6's.
- The transformation is applied to both objects independently. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if (bottom_row, j) in toindices(obj):
        indices.add((bottom_row + 1, j))
  O = fill(I, 4, frozenset(indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Program_A, it identifies non-background objects.
2. **Bottom Row Iteration:** For each object, it iterates through all columns of its bottom row.
3. **Mark Indices:** If a cell belongs to the object, the index one row below is added to 'indices'.
4. **Fill with '4':** Finally, it fills the 'indices' with '4' on the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I) - 1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(4, (i+1, j))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Starts with an empty canvas of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate from Bottom:** Iterates through each column from the bottom row upwards.
3. **Find Non-Background:**  Upon encountering the first non-background cell, places a '4' below it and moves to the next column.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    bottom = {(i+1, j) for (v,(i,j)) in obj if i == lowermost(obj)}
    O = fill(O, 4, frozenset(bottom))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Objects:** Identifies non-background objects.
2. **Get Bottom Indices:** For each object, it creates a set of indices corresponding to the row below its bottom row.
3. **Fill with '4':** Fills the obtained indices with '4' on the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bottom_row = bottomhalf(I)[0]
  indices = set()
  for j, v in enumerate(bottom_row):
    if v != mostcolor(I):
      indices.add((height(I), j))
  O = fill(I, 4, frozenset(indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Bottom Row:** Extracts the bottom row from the input grid.
2. **Identify Non-Background:** Iterates through the bottom row and identifies non-background cells.
3. **Mark Indices:** For each non-background cell, adds the index directly below to 'indices'.
4. **Fill with '4':**  Fills the 'indices' on the original grid with '4'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (height(I) + 1, width(I)))
  O = paint(O, asobject(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    if I[-1][j] != mostcolor(I):
       O = paint(O, {(4, (height(I), j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Output Canvas:** Generates a canvas one row taller than the input.
2. **Copy Input:** Copies the input grid onto the canvas.
3. **Process Bottom Row:** Iterates through the bottom row of the input.
4. **Place '4' below:** If a cell is not background, it places a '4' in the corresponding position one row below on the output canvas.
