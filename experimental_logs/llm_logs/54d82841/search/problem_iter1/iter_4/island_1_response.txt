## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the leftmost and rightmost cells of each distinct object in the input grid, excluding the background.  Then, on the bottom row of the grid, a '4' is placed directly below these leftmost and rightmost points.

**Input 0:**
* Objects: Two '6' objects.
* Left/Rightmost '6' positions: (1,1)/(1,3) and (3,5)/(3,7)
* Output: '4' placed at (7,1)/(7,3) and (7,5)/(7,7)

**Input 1:**
* Objects: One '3' object.
* Left/Rightmost '3' positions: (1,1)/(1,3)
* Output: '4' placed at (4,1)/(4,3)

**Input 2:**
* Objects: One '8' object and one '6' object.
* Left/Rightmost positions: 
    * '8': (1,1)/(1,3)
    * '6': (2,5)/(2,7)
* Output: '4' placed at (4,1)/(4,3) and (4,5)/(4,7)

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  marked_grid = paint(grid, frozenset((4, (h-1, leftmost(obj))) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T)))
  return paint(marked_grid, frozenset((4, (h-1, rightmost(obj))) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(grid, T, F, T)` finds all distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Mark Leftmost:** For each object, `(4, (h-1, leftmost(obj)))` creates a cell with value '4' at the bottom row (`h-1`) and the leftmost column of the object. This cell is painted onto the grid.
3. **Mark Rightmost:** Similar to step 2, `(4, (h-1, rightmost(obj)))` creates a cell at the bottom row and the rightmost column of each object and paints it onto the grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  def mark_extremes(obj):
    return {(4, (h-1, leftmost(obj))), (4, (h-1, rightmost(obj)))}
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(mark_extremes, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **mark_extremes function:** Defines a function that takes an object as input and returns a set containing two cells with value '4': one at the bottom-left and one at the bottom-right corner of the object.
2. **Apply and Merge:**  `apply(mark_extremes, objects(grid, T, F, T))` applies the `mark_extremes` function to each object in the grid and `merge` combines the resulting sets of cells.
3. **Paint:**  Finally, the merged set of cells is painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  corner_indices = frozenset((h - 1, idx) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T) for idx in (leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)))
  return fill(grid, 4, corner_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Corner Indices:**  `corner_indices` is generated by iterating over each object and extracting both its leftmost and rightmost column indices. These indices are then combined with the bottom row index (`h-1`) to form the locations where '4' needs to be placed.
2. **Fill:** The `fill` function places the value '4' at all the indices specified in `corner_indices`.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  def mark_corner(obj, side_fn):
    return (4, (h-1, side_fn(obj)))
  corners =  merge((frozenset(mark_corner(obj, fn) for fn in (leftmost, rightmost)) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T)))
  return paint(grid, corners)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **mark_corner function:** Takes an object and a "side function" (either `leftmost` or `rightmost`) as input. It calculates the position of a corner cell based on the provided side function.
2. **Generate Corners:**  The code iterates over each object and applies `mark_corner` twice, once with `leftmost` and once with `rightmost` to get both corner positions for the object. These positions are then merged into a single set.
3. **Paint:** Finally, the set of corner positions is painted onto the grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  return paint(grid, frozenset((4, (h - 1, f(obj))) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T) for f in (leftmost, rightmost)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Generate Corner Cells:**  The code iterates through each object, applying both `leftmost` and `rightmost` functions to obtain the column indices for corner placement. The row index is fixed to `h - 1` (bottom row).
2. **Paint:** The generated corner cells are then painted onto the grid.
