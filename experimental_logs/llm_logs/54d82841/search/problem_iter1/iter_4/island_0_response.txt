## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies the locations of the rightmost non-zero values in the bottom row of the input grid. Then, it creates a new row beneath the input grid and fills it with zeros. Finally, it places the value '4' at the positions directly below the identified locations in the new bottom row.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # 1. Get the height and width of the input grid.
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)

  # 2. Find the indices of the rightmost non-zero values in the bottom row.
  bottom_row_indices = frozenset((h - 1, j) for j in range(w) if I[h - 1][j] != 0)

  # 3. Shift these indices one row down.
  shifted_indices = shift(bottom_row_indices, DOWN)

  # 4. Create a new canvas with an extra row.
  O = canvas(0, (h + 1, w))

  # 5. Fill '4' at the shifted indices.
  O = fill(O, 4, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The code starts by determining the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`).
2.  It identifies the indices of all non-zero values in the bottom row of the grid and stores them in `bottom_row_indices`.
3.  These indices are shifted one row down using the `shift` function, effectively placing them in a new row below the original grid. 
4.  A new canvas (`O`) is created with the same width as the input grid but with an extra row to accommodate the shifted values.
5.  Finally, the value '4' is filled into the new canvas at the locations specified by the shifted indices.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # 1. Create a canvas with an extra row filled with zeros.
  O = canvas(0, (height(I) + 1, width(I))) 

  # 2. Iterate over the last row of the input grid.
  for j in range(width(I)):
      # 3. If a non-zero value is found:
      if I[height(I) - 1][j] != 0: 
          # 4. Place a '4' in the new bottom row, one position below.
          O = fill(O, 4, {(height(I), j)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. A canvas (`O`) is created, initialized with zeros and sized to be one row taller than the input grid (`I`).
2. The code then iterates through each cell in the last row of the input grid.
3. For each cell, it checks if the value is non-zero.
4. If it is, the program uses the `fill` function to place a '4' at the corresponding position in the new bottom row of the canvas (`O`).

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  # 1. Extract the bottom row of the input grid.
  bottom_row = I[height(I) - 1]

  # 2. Create a new row filled with zeros, one cell longer than the bottom row.
  new_row = [0] * (len(bottom_row) + 1)

  # 3. Iterate over the bottom row.
  for j, value in enumerate(bottom_row):
    # 4. If the value is not zero:
    if value != 0:
      # 5. Place a '4' in the new row, one position to the right.
      new_row[j + 1] = 4

  # 6. Combine the input grid and the new row vertically.
  O = vconcat(I, (tuple(new_row),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version begins by isolating the bottom row of the input grid (`I`).
2. It then constructs a new row (`new_row`) filled with zeros and makes it one cell wider than the extracted bottom row.
3. The code iterates through each value in the bottom row.
4. When it encounters a non-zero value, it inserts a '4' into the new row at a position one cell to the right of the current value's position.
5. Finally, it utilizes the `vconcat` function to append the newly created row to the bottom of the input grid, effectively creating the output grid (`O`).

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # 1. Get the height of the input grid.
  h = height(I)

  # 2. Find indices of non-zero values in the bottom row.
  non_zero_indices = frozenset((h - 1, j) for j in range(width(I)) if I[h - 1][j] != 0)

  # 3. Create a mapping function to shift indices downwards and replace values with '4'.
  transform = lambda ij: (4, (ij[0] + 1, ij[1]))

  # 4. Apply the transformation to the non-zero indices.
  shifted_values = apply(transform, non_zero_indices)

  # 5. Create a canvas for the output grid with an extra row.
  O = canvas(0, (h + 1, width(I)))

  # 6. Paint the shifted values onto the canvas.
  O = paint(O, shifted_values)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. The code first gets the height (`h`) of the input grid.
2. It identifies the indices of all non-zero values in the bottom row and stores them in `non_zero_indices`.
3. A transformation function (`transform`) is defined to shift indices one row down and replace the original value with '4'.
4. This transformation is applied to all the `non_zero_indices`.
5. A canvas (`O`) is created for the output, having an extra row compared to the input.
6. Finally, the transformed values are 'painted' onto the canvas at their new positions.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  # 1. Create a list to store the new bottom row.
  new_row = [0] * width(I)

  # 2. Iterate through the last row of the input grid.
  for j, val in enumerate(I[height(I) - 1]):
    # 3. If the value is not zero:
    if val != 0:
      # 4. Assign '4' to the corresponding position in the new row.
      new_row[j] = 4

  # 5. Construct the output grid by appending the new row to the input grid.
  O = I + (tuple(new_row),) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. The program initializes an empty list (`new_row`) with the same width as the input grid, representing the additional bottom row.
2. It then iterates through each element (`val`) and its index (`j`) in the last row of the input grid (`I`).
3. For each non-zero `val` encountered, the program assigns the value '4' to the corresponding index (`j`) in `new_row`.
4. Finally, it constructs the output grid (`O`) by concatenating the input grid (`I`) with the newly generated `new_row`.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
