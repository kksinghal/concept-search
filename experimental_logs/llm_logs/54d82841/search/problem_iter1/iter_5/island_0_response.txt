## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a new row at the bottom of the input grid. This new row has a '4' placed beneath the rightmost non-zero element of each row in the original grid. The rest of the new row is filled with zeros.

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
```

Output:
```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 
```

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a canvas of zeros with same height and one extra column compared to input.
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 1))
  # 2. Iterate over each row of the input grid.
  for i in range(height(I)):
    # 3. Find the rightmost non-zero element in the row.
    for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        # 4. Place a '4' in the new canvas at the corresponding position one row below.
        O = fill(O, 4, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
        break
  # 5. Concatenate the input grid and the new canvas vertically.
  O = vconcat(I, O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version first creates a canvas filled with zeros. The canvas has the same height as the input but with one extra column to accommodate the potential '4' placement.
2. It then iterates through each row of the input grid.
3. For each row, it iterates backwards to find the rightmost non-zero element.
4. Once found, it places a '4' in the corresponding position of the canvas but one row below.
5. Finally, it concatenates the input grid with the modified canvas vertically to achieve the final output.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Get indices of all non-zero elements in the grid.
    non_zero_indices = ofcolor(I, extract(palette(I) - {0}, lambda x: True))
    # 2. Create a new canvas of zeros with one extra row and column compared to input.
    O = canvas(0, (height(I) + 1, width(I) + 1))
    # 3. Shift the non-zero indices down and right by one position.
    shifted_indices = apply(lambda ij: (ij[0] + 1, ij[1] + 1), non_zero_indices)
    # 4. Fill '4' at the shifted indices in the new canvas.
    O = fill(O, 4, shifted_indices)
    # 5. Concatenate the input grid with the new canvas vertically.
    O = vconcat(I, O)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version utilizes the `ofcolor` function to directly get indices of all non-zero elements in the input grid.
2. It creates a canvas of zeros with an extra row and column to accommodate the shifted elements.
3. It then uses `apply` to shift all the non-zero indices one position down and one position right.
4. The shifted indices are then used with the `fill` function to place '4's at those positions in the new canvas.
5. Finally, it vertically concatenates the input grid with the modified canvas to achieve the final output.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create an empty list to store the new rows.
  new_rows = []
  # 2. Iterate over each row of the input grid.
  for row in I:
    # 3. Create a new row filled with zeros, one cell longer than the current row.
    new_row = [0] * (len(row) + 1)
    # 4. Iterate over the current row.
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      # 5. If the value is not zero:
      if value != 0:
        # 6. Place a '4' in the new row, one position to the right.
        new_row[j + 1] = 4
    # 7. Append the new row to the list of new rows.
    new_rows.append(tuple(new_row))
  # 8. Combine the input grid and the new rows vertically.
  O = vconcat(I, tuple(new_rows))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version focuses on building the new rows separately before concatenating them with the input. It initializes an empty list to store the newly generated rows.
2. It then iterates over each row of the input grid.
3. For each row, it creates a new row filled with zeros, with an extra cell compared to the current row.
4. It then iterates over the elements of the current row.
5. If a non-zero element is found, it places a '4' one position to the right in the new row.
6. This new row is then appended to the list of new rows.
7. Finally, the input grid and the list of new rows are concatenated vertically to get the final output.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Create a canvas of zeros with same height and one extra column compared to input.
    O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 1))
    # 2. Get indices of all cells in the input grid.
    indices = asindices(I)
    # 3. Filter indices to get those with non-zero values.
    non_zero_indices = sfilter(indices, lambda ij: I[ij[0]][ij[1]] != 0)
    # 4. Shift the filtered indices down and right by one position.
    shifted_indices = apply(lambda ij: (ij[0] + 1, ij[1] + 1), non_zero_indices)
    # 5. Fill '4' at the shifted indices in the new canvas.
    O = fill(O, 4, shifted_indices)
    # 6. Concatenate the input grid with the new canvas vertically.
    O = vconcat(I, O)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Similar to version 1, it starts by creating a canvas of zeros with the same height as the input and an extra column.
2. It utilizes the `asindices` function to obtain indices of all cells within the input grid.
3. Then, it filters these indices using `sfilter` to keep only those corresponding to non-zero values in the input.
4. The filtered indices are then shifted one position down and one position right using `apply`.
5. These shifted indices are used to place '4's at the correct positions in the new canvas using `fill`.
6. Finally, it concatenates the input grid with the modified canvas vertically to obtain the final output.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Add a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
  I = hconcat(I, tuple(((0,) * height(I),)))
  # 2. Create a new grid of zeros with the same dimensions as the modified input grid.
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # 3. Iterate over each row of the input grid.
  for i in range(height(I)):
    # 4. Iterate over the current row from right to left, excluding the last element.
    for j in range(width(I) - 2, -1, -1):
      # 5. If the current element is non-zero:
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        # 6. Place a '4' in the new grid, one row below and one cell to the right.
        O = fill(O, 4, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
        break
  # 7. Concatenate the input grid and the new grid vertically.
  O = vconcat(I, O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version starts by adding a column of zeros to the right side of the input grid using `hconcat`, preparing it for the '4' placements.
2. It then creates a new grid filled with zeros, having the same dimensions as the modified input grid.
3. It iterates over each row of the input grid.
4. For each row, it iterates from right to left, excluding the last element (which is now a zero).
5. Upon encountering a non-zero element, it places a '4' in the new grid one row below and one position to the right.
6. Finally, it concatenates the modified input grid with the new grid vertically using `vconcat` to get the final output.
