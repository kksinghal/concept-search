## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to add a new row at the bottom of the input grid. This new row contains '4's placed symmetrically around the center, with all other cells being '0'. The position of the '4's seems to be consistently at one-quarter and three-quarters of the width of the grid.

**Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** A new row with '4's at positions 2 and 6 (1/4 and 3/4 of the width, 8) is added. 
* **Input_1 to Output_1:**  A new row with '4's at position 2 (1/4 of the width, 5) is added. Since the width is odd, the second '4' would fall at position 3 (3/4 of 5), which overlaps with the first '4', so only one '4' is present.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** A new row with '4's at positions 1 and 5 (1/4 and 3/4 of the width, 7) is added.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:** (Using `width`, `range`, list comprehension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = width(I)
  new_row = [4 if j in (w // 4, 3 * w // 4) else 0 for j in range(w)]
  return vconcat(I, (tuple(new_row),)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`w = width(I)`:** Calculates the width of the input grid `I`.
2. **`new_row = [4 if j in (w // 4, 3 * w // 4) else 0 for j in range(w)]`:** Creates the new row using a list comprehension. For each column `j` in the range of the width, it places a '4' if the column is at 1/4 or 3/4 of the width, else it places a '0'.
3. **`return vconcat(I, (tuple(new_row),))`:** Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created `new_row` (converted to a tuple) vertically and returns the result.

**Version 2:** (Using `apply`, `lambda`, `if-else`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = width(I)
  new_row = apply(lambda j: 4 if j in (w // 4, 3 * w // 4) else 0, tuple(range(w)))
  return vconcat(I, (new_row,)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`w = width(I)`:** Calculates the width of the input grid `I`.
2. **`new_row = apply(lambda j: 4 if j in (w // 4, 3 * w // 4) else 0, tuple(range(w)))`:** Creates the new row using the `apply` function. A `lambda` function checks for each column index `j` if it corresponds to 1/4 or 3/4 of the width and assigns '4' if true and '0' otherwise.
3. **`return vconcat(I, (new_row,))`:** Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created `new_row` vertically and returns the result.

**Version 3:** (Using `for` loop and conditional assignment)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = width(I)
  new_row = tuple()
  for j in range(w):
    if j == w // 4 or j == 3 * w // 4:
      new_row += (4,)
    else:
      new_row += (0,)
  return vconcat(I, (new_row,))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`w = width(I)`:**  Calculates the width of the input grid.
2. **Loop and Conditional:** The code iterates through column indices, adding a '4' to the new row if the index matches one-quarter or three-quarters of the width; otherwise, it adds a '0'.
3. **`return vconcat(I, (new_row,))`:** Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created `new_row` vertically and returns the result.

**Version 4:** (Using sets and set operations)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = width(I)
  indices = frozenset(range(w))
  quarters = {w // 4, 3 * w // 4}
  fours = indices & quarters
  zeros = indices - fours
  new_row = tuple(4 if j in fours else 0 for j in indices)
  return vconcat(I, (new_row,))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sets and Operations:** This version utilizes set operations to determine the positions of '4's. It finds the intersection of all column indices with the set of quarter positions, effectively identifying where to place '4's.
2. **`new_row = tuple(4 if j in fours else 0 for j in indices)`:** Creates a new row by iterating over all column indices, placing a '4' if the index exists in the 'fours' set, indicating a quarter position, and a '0' otherwise.
3. **`return vconcat(I, (new_row,))`:** Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created `new_row` vertically and returns the result.

**Version 5:** (Leveraging symmetry)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = width(I)
  half_row = tuple(4 if j == w // 4 else 0 for j in range(w // 2))
  new_row = half_row + half_row[::-1]
  return vconcat(I, (new_row,))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Exploiting Symmetry:** This version cleverly utilizes symmetry to simplify the process. It generates only half of the new row and then mirrors it to create the complete row.
2. **`half_row = tuple(4 if j == w // 4 else 0 for j in range(w // 2))`:** Generates the first half of the new row, placing a '4' at the one-quarter position and '0's elsewhere. 
3. **`new_row = half_row + half_row[::-1]`:**  Concatenates the first half with its reversed copy, effectively mirroring it to create the full new row.
4. **`return vconcat(I, (new_row,))`:** Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created `new_row` vertically and returns the result.

These diverse code versions demonstrate a range of approaches to achieve the desired transformation, offering flexibility and efficiency in different scenarios.
