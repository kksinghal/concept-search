## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves adding a new row at the bottom of the input grid. This new row places the digit '4' symmetrically around the vertical center line of the grid, with all other positions filled with '0'.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- A new row is added below the last row of Input_0.
- Two '4's are placed symmetrically around the center (4th and 6th position) of the new row. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
-  Similar to the previous transformation, a new row with two '4's is added. 
- The '4's are placed at the 3rd and 5th positions of the new row.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Again, a new row with two '4's is added.
- The '4's are, as before, positioned symmetrically around the center.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = width(I)  # Get the width of the input grid
  new_row = tuple(4 if j in {w // 2 - 1, w // 2} else 0 for j in range(w)) # Create new row with 4s at center
  return vconcat(I, (new_row,)) # Concatenate input grid and the new row 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`w = width(I)`:** Calculates the width of the input grid `I` and stores it in the variable `w`.
2. **`new_row = ...`:**  Creates a new row as a tuple. It iterates through each column index `j` from 0 to `w`.  If `j` is one position before or at the center (`w // 2`), it inserts '4'; otherwise, it inserts '0'.
3. **`return vconcat(I, (new_row,))`:** Vertically concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created `new_row`, effectively adding the new row at the bottom and returning the resulting grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  center_j = width(I) // 2 # Calculate the center column index
  new_row = tuple(0 for _ in range(width(I))) # Initialize a row of zeros
  return vconcat(I, (tuple(4 if j in {center_j - 1, center_j} else new_row[j] for j in range(width(I))),)) # Update the center elements with 4s and concatenate
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`center_j = width(I) // 2`:**  Calculates the index of the center column.
2. **`new_row = tuple(0 for _ in range(width(I)))`:** Creates a new tuple representing a row filled with zeros, having the same width as the input grid.
3. **`return vconcat(I, (tuple(...)))`:**  Vertically concatenates the input grid with a new tuple created inline. This new tuple iterates over column indices and places '4' at the positions adjacent to the `center_j` while keeping the rest of the elements from the `new_row` (which are zeros).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return vconcat(I, (apply(lambda j: 4 if abs(j - width(I) // 2) < 1 else 0, range(width(I))),)) # Apply conditional 4 placement to each column index
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`return vconcat(I, (apply(...)))`:**  Vertically concatenates the input grid `I` with the result of applying a function to each element of a range. 
2. **`apply(lambda j: ..., range(width(I)))`:** This part applies a lambda function to each column index `j` within a range representing the grid's width. The lambda function checks if the absolute difference between the column index and the center column index (`width(I) // 2`) is less than 1. If true (meaning the column is adjacent to the center), it returns '4'; otherwise, it returns '0'. This effectively generates the new row with '4's at the center.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return vconcat(I, ((lambda x: (tuple(4 if j in x else 0 for j in range(width(I)))))(({width(I) // 2 - 1, width(I) // 2})))) # Use lambda function to generate the new row with specified indices for '4' placement
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more functional approach with lambda functions and nested tuples:

1. **`return vconcat(I, ((lambda x: ...)(...)))`:**  Vertically concatenates the input grid with the result of calling a lambda function.
2. **`(lambda x: (tuple(...)))(({...}))`:** Defines a lambda function that takes a set of indices `x`. It then generates a tuple representing a new row. For each column index in the grid's width, if the index is present in the set `x`, it places '4'; otherwise, it places '0'. The lambda function is immediately called with a set containing the indices of the two center columns. This cleverly generates the new row with '4's at the desired locations.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_row = list((0,) * width(I))  # Initialize a list of zeros
  new_row[width(I) // 2 - 1] = 4 # Set left center element to 4
  new_row[width(I) // 2] = 4 # Set right center element to 4
  return vconcat(I, (tuple(new_row),)) # Concatenate the input grid and the modified new row
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a more direct approach by modifying a list to create the new row:

1. **`new_row = list((0,) * width(I))`:** Creates a list `new_row` initialized with zeros, having the same width as the input grid.
2. **`new_row[width(I) // 2 - 1] = 4`** and **`new_row[width(I) // 2] = 4`**: Directly sets the elements at the indices corresponding to the center columns to '4'.
3. **`return vconcat(I, (tuple(new_row),))`:**  Vertically concatenates the input grid `I` with the modified `new_row` (converted to a tuple), effectively adding the new row with '4's at the center.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same grid transformation. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL and offer different perspectives on solving the problem.
