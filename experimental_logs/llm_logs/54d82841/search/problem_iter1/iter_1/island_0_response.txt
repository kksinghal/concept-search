## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently adds a new horizontal line of '4's at the bottom of the grid. The line is not continuous, and the placement of the '4's seems to depend on the presence of non-zero digits in the input grid's bottom row. 

Let's break down the logic for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- A new bottom row with '4's is added.
- The '4's are placed below the positions of the '6's in the original bottom row.

**Input_1:**

-  Similar to Input_0, a new bottom row with a '4' is added below the rightmost '3' of the original bottom row. 

**Input_2:**

-  Again, a new bottom row is added with '4's placed beneath the non-zero digits ('6's) of the original bottom row.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = bottomhalf(I)  # Extract the bottom row
  x2 = asindices(x1) # Get indices of bottom row
  x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda ij: I[ij[0]][ij[1]] != 0)  # Filter indices with non-zero values
  x4 = shift(x3, (1, 0)) # Shift indices one row down 
  O = fill(I, 4, x4) # Fill the shifted indices with '4'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract bottom row:** `x1 = bottomhalf(I)` extracts the bottom row of the input grid.
2. **Get indices:** `x2 = asindices(x1)` gets the indices of all cells in the bottom row.
3. **Filter non-zero indices:** `x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda ij: I[ij[0]][ij[1]] != 0)` filters the indices to keep only those where the corresponding cell in the input grid is not zero.
4. **Shift down:** `x4 = shift(x3, (1, 0))` shifts the filtered indices one row down.
5. **Fill with '4's:** `O = fill(I, 4, x4)` fills the cells at the shifted indices with the value '4'.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, False, False, True) # Get objects excluding background
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == len(I) - 1) # Filter objects touching bottom edge
  x3 = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), (1, 0)), x2) # Shift the indices of these objects down
  O = I
  for x in x3:
    O = fill(O, 4, x) # Fill the shifted indices with '4'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify bottom-touching objects:** The code first identifies objects touching the bottom edge of the grid.
2. **Shift down:** It shifts these objects one row down.
3. **Fill with '4's:**  Finally, it fills the shifted object positions in the grid with the value '4'.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I) # Get the height of the input grid
  x1 = asindices(I) # Get indices of all cells
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda ij: ij[0] == h-1 and I[ij[0]][ij[1]] != 0) # Filter indices at the bottom row with non-zero values
  x3 = apply(lambda ij: (ij[0]+1, ij[1]), x2) # Shift the filtered indices one row down
  O = fill(I, 4, x3) # Fill the shifted indices with '4'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get bottom row indices:** This version directly identifies the indices of the bottom row.
2. **Filter non-zero indices:** It filters those indices to keep only the ones with non-zero cell values.
3. **Shift down:** It shifts these indices one row down.
4. **Fill with '4's:** It fills the cells at the shifted indices with '4'.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = vsplit(I, height(I)) # Split the grid into individual rows
  x2 = last(x1) # Extract the last row
  x3 = asindices(x2) # Get the indices of the last row 
  x4 = sfilter(x3, lambda ij: x2[ij[0]][ij[1]] != 0) # Filter indices with non-zero values
  x5 = shift(x4, (height(I), 0)) # Shift indices to the bottom row of the grid
  O = fill(I, 4, x5) # Fill the shifted indices with '4'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split into rows:** This version splits the grid into individual rows.
2. **Process last row:** It focuses on the last row, extracting its indices. 
3. **Filter non-zero indices:** It filters the indices, keeping those with non-zero values.
4. **Shift to bottom:**  It shifts the filtered indices to the bottom of the grid.
5. **Fill with '4's:** It then fills those positions with the value '4'. 

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create a canvas of same shape as input, filled with '0's
  x2 = bottomhalf(I) # Extract the bottom row of the input grid
  x3 = asindices(x2) # Get indices of the bottom row
  x4 = sfilter(x3, lambda ij: x2[ij[0]][ij[1]] != 0) # Filter indices with non-zero values in the bottom row 
  x5 = apply(lambda ij: (ij[0]+1, ij[1]), x4) # Shift the filtered indices one row down
  O = fill(x1, 4, x5) # Fill '4' at the shifted indices in the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** This version starts by creating an empty canvas of the same size as the input grid.
2. **Identify non-zero positions:** It identifies the positions of non-zero values in the bottom row of the input.
3. **Shift down:**  It shifts those positions one row down. 
4. **Fill on canvas:** Finally, it fills the shifted positions on the initially empty canvas with '4', creating the desired output.

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and diversity possible within the DSL. Each version provides a unique solution by combining DSL functions in distinct ways.
