## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify distinct objects within the input grid (excluding the background color, which is the most frequent color) and mark the leftmost and rightmost bottom cells of each object with the color '4'.

**Input_0:** 
- Two distinct '6' objects are identified.
- The bottom leftmost and bottom rightmost cells of each '6' object are replaced with '4'.

**Input_1:**
- One distinct '3' object is identified.
- The bottom leftmost and bottom rightmost cells of the '3' object are replaced with '4'.

**Input_2:**
- Two distinct objects are identified: '8' and '6'.
- The bottom leftmost and bottom rightmost cells of each object are replaced with '4'. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  f = lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj)), (h-1, rightmost(obj))}
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(compose(lbind(fill, 4), f), objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies distinct objects in the grid (treating connected cells of the same color as a single object, excluding the background).
2. **`f = lambda obj: {(h-1, leftmost(obj)), (h-1, rightmost(obj))}`:** Defines a lambda function 'f' that, given an object, returns a set containing the indices of the bottom-leftmost and bottom-rightmost cells of that object.
3. **`apply(compose(lbind(fill, 4), f), objects(grid, T, F, T))`:** 
   - Applies the composed function to each object identified in step 1.
   - **`compose(lbind(fill, 4), f)`**: This first applies 'f' to get the desired indices and then uses `lbind(fill, 4)` to fill those indices with the color '4' in the grid. 
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the results (sets of modified cells) from all objects into a single set.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:**  Paints the original grid with the modifications from the merged set, effectively replacing the target cells with '4'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(height(grid)-1, leftmost(obj), 4), (height(grid)-1, rightmost(obj), 4)}, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:** Identifies the distinct objects, excluding the background.
2. **`lambda obj: {(height(grid)-1, leftmost(obj), 4), (height(grid)-1, rightmost(obj), 4)}`:** For each object, creates a set containing tuples representing the bottom-leftmost and bottom-rightmost cells with the new color '4'.
3. **`apply(..., objects(grid, T, F, T))`:** Applies the lambda function to each identified object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting sets of modified cells from each object.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** Paints the original grid using the merged set, effectively changing the target cells to '4'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(lambda obj: insert((h-1, rightmost(obj), 4), initset((h-1, leftmost(obj), 4))), objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:** Finds the distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`lambda obj: insert((h-1, rightmost(obj), 4), initset((h-1, leftmost(obj), 4)))`:** This lambda function, for each object:
     - Creates a set (`initset`) containing a tuple representing the bottom-leftmost cell and its new color '4'.
     - Inserts a tuple representing the bottom-rightmost cell and its new color '4' into the previously created set.
3. **`apply(..., objects(grid, T, F, T))`:** Applies the lambda function to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting sets of modified cells from each object.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** Applies the merged set to the original grid, effectively changing the target cells to '4'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  g = lambda obj: (h-1, leftmost(obj))
  f = lambda obj: (h-1, rightmost(obj))
  return paint(grid, merge({apply(compose(lbind(fill, 4), g), objects(grid, T, F, T)), apply(compose(lbind(fill, 4), f), objects(grid, T, F, T))}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`g = lambda obj: (h-1, leftmost(obj))` & `f = lambda obj: (h-1, rightmost(obj))`:** Define two lambda functions 'g' and 'f' to extract the bottom-leftmost and bottom-rightmost cell indices of an object, respectively.
2. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:** Identifies the distinct objects, excluding the background.
3. **`apply(compose(lbind(fill, 4), g), objects(...))` & `apply(compose(lbind(fill, 4), f), objects(...))`:** Apply 'g' and 'f' to each object and then use `lbind(fill, 4)` to fill those indices with '4'.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting sets of modified cells.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:**  Paints the original grid with the merged set, changing the target cells to '4'. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
  h = height(grid)
  out = grid
  for obj in objs:
    out = fill(out, 4, {(h-1, leftmost(obj))})
    out = fill(out, 4, {(h-1, rightmost(obj))}) 
  return out
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:** Extracts the different objects in the grid (excluding the background).
2. **`for obj in objs`:** Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`out = fill(out, 4, {(h-1, leftmost(obj))})`:** Fills the bottom-leftmost cell of the current object with '4'.
4. **`out = fill(out, 4, {(h-1, rightmost(obj))})`:** Fills the bottom-rightmost cell of the current object with '4'.
5. **`return out`:** Returns the modified grid.

These five program versions showcase different approaches and function combinations to achieve the desired outcome, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
