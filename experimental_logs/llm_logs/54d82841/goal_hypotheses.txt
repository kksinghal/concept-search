['Copy the input grid. Then, add a green square in the bottom left and bottom right corners of the grid.', 'Copy the input grid. Then, place green squares in the bottom row, in the second and sixth columns.', 'Maintain the input grid. Add green squares at the bottom of the grid, two positions from the left and right edges.', 'Keep the input grid unchanged. Then, draw two green squares symmetrically at the bottom edge of the grid, leaving two empty spaces between them and the edges.', 'Preserve the input grid. Then, insert two green squares in the second and sixth positions of the bottom row. ']['Find the leftmost and rightmost colored shapes in the input grid. Place a yellow square in the bottom row of the grid, centered horizontally on each shape.', 'Identify the leftmost and rightmost colored regions in the input. In the bottom row, place a yellow square centered below each of these regions.', 'Locate the leftmost and rightmost colored areas in the input. Place a yellow square in the bottom row, centered horizontally beneath each of these areas.', 'For each of the leftmost and rightmost colored shapes in the input, place a yellow square directly below its center in the bottom row.', 'Determine the horizontal span of the leftmost and rightmost colored regions in the input. Place a yellow square in the bottom row, centered below each of these spans. ']['Split the input grid into two 3x2 grids. Rotate the left grid 90 degrees clockwise and the right grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Place the rotated grids side by side in the output grid. If a grid extends beyond the boundaries of the output grid, truncate it. Fill any empty cells in the output grid with black.', "Divide the input grid into two 3x2 subgrids. Rotate the left subgrid 90 degrees clockwise and the right subgrid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Position these rotated subgrids next to each other in the output grid. Truncate any portions of the subgrids that exceed the output grid's dimensions. Any remaining empty cells in the output grid should be filled with black.", 'Take the input grid and divide it into two 3x2 sections. The left section should be rotated 90 degrees clockwise, while the right section should be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. These rotated sections are then placed side-by-side in the output grid. If any part of a rotated section falls outside the output grid, it is removed. Finally, all empty spaces in the output grid are filled with black.', "Separate the input grid into two 3x2 grids. The left grid is rotated clockwise by 90 degrees, and the right grid is rotated counter-clockwise by 90 degrees. These rotated grids are then positioned adjacent to each other within the output grid. Any parts of the rotated grids that extend beyond the output grid's boundaries are trimmed. Empty cells in the output grid are filled with black.", 'The input grid is divided into two 3x2 grids. The left grid is rotated 90 degrees in a clockwise direction, while the right grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. These rotated grids are then placed next to each other in the output grid. If any part of the rotated grids goes beyond the edges of the output grid, it is cut off. Any remaining empty cells in the output grid are filled with black. ']
