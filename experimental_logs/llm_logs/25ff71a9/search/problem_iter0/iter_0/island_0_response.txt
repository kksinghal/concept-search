## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently shifts the input grid downwards by one row. The original bottom row disappears, and a new row filled with zeros is added at the top. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

* **Input 0:** The row of '1's shifts one step down, and a new row of '0's is added at the top.
* **Input 1:**  The row of '1's shifts one step down, and a new row of '0's is added at the top.
* **Input 2:** The 'L' shaped figure shifts down by one row. A new row of '0's is added at the top.
* **Input 3:** Similar to other examples, the figure shifts down by one row, and a new row of '0's is added at the top.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL from  `dsl.py` to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Shifts the input grid down by one row, 
  adding a row of zeros at the top.
  """
  O = vconcat(canvas(ZERO, (1, width(I))), bottomhalf(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottomhalf(I)`:** Extracts the bottom half of the input grid `I`.
2. **`canvas(ZERO, (1, width(I)))`:** Creates a new grid of size 1 row x `width(I)` columns, filled with zeros.
3. **`vconcat(...)`:** Vertically concatenates the new zero-filled grid on top of the bottom half of the original grid, effectively shifting the original grid down by one row.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Shifts the input grid down by one row, 
  adding a row of zeros at the top.
  """
  O = trim(vconcat(canvas(ZERO, (2, width(I))), I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`canvas(ZERO, (2, width(I)))`:**  Creates a 2-row grid filled with zeros, matching the width of input grid `I`.
2.  **`vconcat(...)`:** Vertically concatenates the 2-row zero grid with the input grid `I`, padding it with two zero rows at the top.
3.  **`trim(...)`:**  Removes one row from the top and bottom of the concatenated grid, effectively shifting the original content down by one row.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Shifts the input grid down by one row, 
  adding a row of zeros at the top.
  """
  O = rot90(hconcat(rot270(bottomhalf(I)), canvas(ZERO, (width(I), 1))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottomhalf(I)`:**  Extracts the bottom half of the input grid `I`.
2. **`rot270(...)`:** Rotates the bottom half 270 degrees counter-clockwise, effectively placing it on its side.
3. **`canvas(ZERO, (width(I), 1))`:** Creates a single-column grid of zeros with a height matching the width of the input grid `I`.
4. **`hconcat(...)`:** Horizontally concatenates the rotated bottom half with the zero column, effectively placing the zeros on the right.
5. **`rot90(...)`:** Rotates the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise, bringing it to the desired output orientation with the original grid shifted down and a new row of zeros at the top.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Shifts the input grid down by one row, 
  adding a row of zeros at the top.
  """
  shifted = tuple(tuple(ZERO for _ in range(width(I)) )) + I 
  O = tuple(row for i, row in enumerate(shifted) if i < height(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`shifted = ...`:** Creates a new grid (`shifted`) by:
    *   Creating a tuple containing a single row of zeros with the same width as the input grid `I`.
    *   Concatenating this zero row with the original grid `I`, effectively adding a zero row at the top.
2.  **`O = ...`:** Extracts rows from `shifted` up to the original height of `I`, effectively removing the extra row added in the previous step. This leaves the grid shifted down by one row.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Shifts the input grid down by one row, 
  adding a row of zeros at the top.
  """
  O = tuple(I[i-1] if i > 0 else tuple(ZERO for _ in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`O = ...`:** Uses a list comprehension to construct the output grid `O`:
    *  **`for i in range(height(I))`:** Iterates through each row index of the input grid.
    *  **`I[i-1] if i > 0 ...`:** If the row index `i` is greater than 0, it takes the row above ( `I[i-1]`) from the input grid.
    *  **`... else tuple(ZERO for _ in range(width(I)))`:** If the row index `i` is 0 (the first row), it creates a new row of zeros with the same width as the input grid.

This effectively shifts each row down by one and fills the top row with zeros.
