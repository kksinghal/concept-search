## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and replacing their original color with a new color derived from a specific cell within the object. The transformation applies to all objects in the input grid.

**Specific Logic:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Objects are defined as connected groups of cells with the same digit, considering only direct neighbors (no diagonals).
2. **Find Target Cell:** Within each object, the target cell is the one located at the upper-leftmost position.
3. **Extract New Color:** The digit present in the target cell of each object becomes the new color for the entire object.
4. **Recolor Objects:** All cells belonging to an object are recolored with the extracted new color.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_2dee498d(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  for obj in objs:
    new_color = color(obj)
    I = paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(new_color, obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid (`I`) based on connected cells with the same digit (univalued = `T`), considering only direct neighbors (diagonal = `F`), and including the background as an object (without_bg = `F`).
2. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`new_color = color(obj)`:**  Extracts the digit value (color) of the first cell in the object, which represents the new color for the entire object.
4. **`I = paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(new_color, obj))`:** First, it "erases" the original object from the grid using `cover` by replacing it with the background color. Then, it "repaints" the object at the same location with the `new_color` using `recolor`.
5. **`return I`:** Returns the modified grid.


**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_2dee498d(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I):
        new_color = index(I, ulcorner(objects(crop(I, (i, j), (1, 1)), T, F, F)))
        I = paint(I, recolor(new_color, objects(crop(I, (i, j), (1, 1)), T, F, F)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i in range(len(I))` and `for j in range(len(I[0]))`:**  Iterates over each cell in the grid.
2. **`if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I):`:** Checks if the current cell is not the background color (assuming the background is the most common color).
3. **`new_color = index(I, ulcorner(objects(crop(I, (i, j), (1, 1)), T, F, F)))`**: Extracts the new color by:
    - `crop(I, (i, j), (1, 1))`: Creating a 1x1 subgrid containing only the current cell.
    - `objects(..., T, F, F)`: Identifying the object within this subgrid (which is just the cell itself).
    - `ulcorner(...)`: Getting the upper-left corner index of the object.
    - `index(I, ...)`: Retrieving the color value at that index from the original grid.
4. **`I = paint(I, recolor(new_color, objects(crop(I, (i, j), (1, 1)), T, F, F)))`**: Similar to version 1, it recolors the object containing the current cell with the `new_color`.
5. **`return I`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_2dee498d(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, ulcorner(obj)), obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an output grid (`O`) filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):`:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **`O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, ulcorner(obj)), obj))`:** Recolors the object on the output grid (`O`) with the new color extracted from the upper-left corner of the object in the input grid.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the modified output grid.


**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_2dee498d(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    target_cell = ulcorner(obj)
    new_color = index(I, target_cell)
    O = fill(O, new_color, toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):`:**  Iterates through each identified object in the input grid.
3. **`target_cell = ulcorner(obj)`:** Determines the upper-left corner cell of the current object.
4. **`new_color = index(I, target_cell)`:** Extracts the digit at the `target_cell` from the input grid as the `new_color`.
5. **`O = fill(O, new_color, toindices(obj))`:** Fills all cells belonging to the current object in the output grid (`O`) with the `new_color`.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_2dee498d(I):
  new_grid = []
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    new_row = []
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcommon(I):
        obj = list(objects(crop(I, (i, j), (1, 1)), T, F, F))[0]
        new_color = index(I, ulcorner(obj))
        new_row.append(new_color)
      else:
        new_row.append(val)
    new_grid.append(tuple(new_row))
  return tuple(new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_grid = []`:** Initializes an empty list to store the transformed grid.
2. **`for i, row in enumerate(I):`:** Iterates through each row of the input grid (`I`) with its index `i`.
3. **`new_row = []`:** Initializes an empty list for each new row.
4. **`for j, val in enumerate(row):`:** Iterates through each value (`val`) in the current row with its index `j`.
5. **`if val != mostcommon(I):`:** If the current cell is not the background color:
    - `obj = list(objects(crop(I, (i, j), (1, 1)), T, F, F))[0]`:**  Identifies the object containing the current cell.
    - `new_color = index(I, ulcorner(obj))`:** Extracts the color from the upper-left corner of the object.
    - `new_row.append(new_color)`:**  Appends the `new_color` to the `new_row`.
6. **`else:`:** If the current cell is the background color:
    - `new_row.append(val)`:**  Appends the original value to the `new_row`.
7. **`new_grid.append(tuple(new_row))`:** After processing each row, append the `new_row` to the `new_grid`.
8. **`return tuple(new_grid)`:** Returns the `new_grid` as a tuple of tuples, representing the final transformed grid.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same grid transformation using the provided DSL. They illustrate the flexibility and variety of solutions possible within the DSL's constraints.
