## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be thinning out the objects in the grid, keeping only the outline and a single horizontal and vertical line within each object. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The "8" object retains its outline, but only the middle row and column are kept. 
- The "3" object retains its outline, but only the bottom row and rightmost column are kept.
- The "6" and "7" objects retain their outlines, but only the top row and leftmost column are kept.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The "2" object retains its outline, but only the top and bottom rows, along with the leftmost and rightmost columns, are kept.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- The "5" object retains its outline, but only the top and bottom rows, along with the leftmost and rightmost columns, are kept.
- The "4" object retains its outline, but only the top and bottom rows, along with the leftmost column are kept.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
    thinned_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
      top_row = min(i for v, (i, j) in obj)
      bottom_row = max(i for v, (i, j) in obj)
      left_col = min(j for v, (i, j) in obj)
      right_col = max(j for v, (i, j) in obj)
      thinned_obj = frozenset()
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        if i == top_row or i == bottom_row or j == left_col or j == right_col:
          thinned_obj = thinned_obj | {(v, (i, j))}
      thinned_objs = thinned_objs | {thinned_obj}
    O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(thinned_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` finds all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The program loops through each object found.
3. **Find extreme rows and columns:** For each object, the program determines the top, bottom, leftmost, and rightmost rows and columns.
4. **Construct thinned object:** A new object is constructed, containing only the cells on the extreme rows and columns.
5. **Paint thinned objects:** All thinned objects are painted onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
    result = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
      result = paint(result, box(obj))
    return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` finds all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Create a blank canvas:** `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` generates a blank canvas with the same size and background color as the input grid.
3. **Iterate through objects and paint outlines:** The program loops through each object and paints the outline of each object onto the canvas using `box(obj)` and `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
        O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` finds all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through objects and fill inner cells:** The program loops through each object and fills the cells within the object's bounding box, excluding the outline, with the background color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  thinned_objs = apply(lambda obj: toobject(box(obj), I), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(thinned_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` finds all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Extract object outlines:** `apply(lambda obj: toobject(box(obj), I), objs)` extracts the outlines of all objects using `box` and `toobject` functions.
3. **Paint outlines onto canvas:** The extracted outlines are then painted onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in product(interval(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)), interval(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj))):
      O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` finds all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through inner cells and fill:**  The program loops through each object and uses `product` and `interval` functions to iterate over the inner cells within the object's bounding box, excluding the outline. It then fills those cells with the background color using the `fill` function.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
