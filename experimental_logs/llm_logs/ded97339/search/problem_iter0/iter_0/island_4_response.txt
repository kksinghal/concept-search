## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending objects composed of the digit '8' in the input grid:

* **Horizontal Extension:** If an '8' object has another '8' object directly below it, extend the top object horizontally to connect with the bottom object.
* **Vertical Extension:** If an '8' object has another '8' object directly to its right, extend the left object vertically to connect with the right object. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The top-left '8' object extends right to connect with the bottom-left '8' object.
* The top-right '8' object extends left to connect with the bottom-right '8' object.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The '8' object in the rightmost column extends upwards to connect with the '8' object above it.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The top '8' object extends right to connect with the other '8' objects in its row.
* The bottom left '8' object extends upwards to connect with the other '8' objects in its column.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL provided:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify all '8' objects
  h_extended = frozenset()
  for obj1 in objs:
    for obj2 in objs:
      if uppermost(obj1) + 1 == uppermost(obj2) and hmatching(obj1, obj2): # Check for objects directly above/below
        h_extended = insert(combine(toindices(obj1), connect(leftmost(obj1), leftmost(obj2))), h_extended) # Extend horizontally
  v_extended = frozenset()
  for obj1 in objs:
    for obj2 in objs:
      if leftmost(obj1) + 1 == leftmost(obj2) and vmatching(obj1, obj2): # Check for objects directly left/right
        v_extended = insert(combine(toindices(obj1), connect(uppermost(obj1), uppermost(obj2))), v_extended) # Extend vertically
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, merge((h_extended, v_extended)))  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all objects formed by the digit '8' using `objects` with `univalued=T` (only '8's), `diagonal=F` (no diagonal connections), and `without_bg=T` (exclude background).
2. **Horizontal Extension:**
   - Iterate through object pairs.
   - Use `uppermost`, `hmatching` to find objects directly above/below.
   - If found, use `connect` and `combine` to create a horizontal line connecting them.
   - Store extended indices in `h_extended`.
3. **Vertical Extension:**
   - Similar logic to horizontal extension, using `leftmost`, `vmatching` to find objects directly left/right.
   - Use `connect`, `combine` to create a vertical connecting line.
   - Store extended indices in `v_extended`.
4. **Fill Grid:**
   - Merge `h_extended`, `v_extended` to get all extended indices.
   - Fill these indices with the value '8' on the original grid using `fill`.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  extended_indices = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    down_neighbor = extract(objs, lambda o: uppermost(o) == uppermost(obj) + 1 and hmatching(o, obj), default=frozenset()) # Find the object directly below
    if down_neighbor:
      extended_indices = combine(extended_indices, connect(leftmost(obj), leftmost(down_neighbor))) # Extend horizontally
    right_neighbor = extract(objs, lambda o: leftmost(o) == leftmost(obj) + 1 and vmatching(o, obj), default=frozenset()) # Find the object directly to the right
    if right_neighbor:
      extended_indices = combine(extended_indices, connect(uppermost(obj), uppermost(right_neighbor))) # Extend vertically
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, extended_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** 
   - Iterate through each '8' object.
   - Use `extract` with a lambda function to efficiently find the object directly below (if it exists) based on the `uppermost` and `hmatching` conditions.
   - If a below neighbor is found, use `connect` to get indices for a horizontal line connecting their leftmost points and combine these indices with `extended_indices`.
   - Repeat the same logic but using `leftmost` and `vmatching` to find the right neighbor and connect vertically if found.
3. **Fill Grid:** Fill the `extended_indices` with '8' on the original grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  changed = T
  while changed:
    changed = F
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    for obj1 in objs:
      for obj2 in objs:
        if uppermost(obj1) + 1 == uppermost(obj2) and hmatching(obj1, obj2) and not hline(combine(obj1, obj2)): # Check if already a horizontal line
          I = fill(I, EIGHT, connect(leftmost(obj1), leftmost(obj2))) # Directly fill the grid
          changed = T 
        if leftmost(obj1) + 1 == leftmost(obj2) and vmatching(obj1, obj2) and not vline(combine(obj1, obj2)): # Check if already a vertical line
          I = fill(I, EIGHT, connect(uppermost(obj1), uppermost(obj2)))
          changed = T
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Approach:** This version iteratively updates the grid until no more extensions are possible.
2. **Loop and Extend:**
   - Use a `while` loop with a `changed` flag to control iterations.
   - In each iteration, find all '8' objects.
   - Iterate through object pairs, checking for directly adjacent objects (above/below or left/right) using `uppermost`, `leftmost`, `hmatching`, `vmatching`.
   - If an extension is possible AND the combined object isn't already a straight line (`hline` or `vline`), directly fill the grid with '8' along the connecting line using `connect`.
   - Set `changed` to `T` to indicate a change in the grid.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The loop continues until no more extensions are possible, at which point the modified grid is returned.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  h_connections = mpapply(lambda o1, o2: connect(leftmost(o1), leftmost(o2)) if uppermost(o1) + 1 == uppermost(o2) and hmatching(o1, o2) else frozenset(), objs, objs)
  v_connections = mpapply(lambda o1, o2: connect(uppermost(o1), uppermost(o2)) if leftmost(o1) + 1 == leftmost(o2) and vmatching(o1, o2) else frozenset(), objs, objs)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, merge((h_connections, v_connections)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Connections:**
   - Use `mpapply` to efficiently find potential horizontal connections between objects. The lambda function within `mpapply` checks for adjacent objects in the same way as previous versions, returning the connecting line indices using `connect` if a connection is found, and an empty `frozenset` otherwise.
   - Do the same for vertical connections using `leftmost` and `vmatching`.
3. **Fill Grid:** Merge the horizontal and vertical connection indices and fill them with '8' on the original grid.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  extended = frozenset()
  for i in range(len(I)-1):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == EIGHT and I[i+1][j] == EIGHT:
        extended = combine(extended, connect((i, j), (i+1, j)))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == EIGHT and I[i][j+1] == EIGHT:
        extended = combine(extended, connect((i, j), (i, j+1)))
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, extended)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Iteration:** This version iterates directly through the grid cells.
2. **Check and Extend:**
   - Use nested loops to go through each cell.
   - Check if the current cell and its neighbor below contain '8'. If so, add the connecting line indices to the `extended` set.
   - Repeat for the right neighbor.
3. **Fill Grid:** Fill the `extended` indices with '8' on the original grid.


These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the same grid transformation, showcasing different function combinations and logical flows possible within the provided DSL.
