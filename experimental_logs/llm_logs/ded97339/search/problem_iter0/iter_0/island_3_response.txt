## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects non-background digits in each input grid horizontally. 

* **Input 0:** The two '8' digits on the 4th row are connected, as are the '8' digits in the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th columns.
* **Input 1:** The '8' digits in the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th rows are connected horizontally. The '8' digits in the 8th and 9th columns are also connected.
* **Input 2:** The '8' digits in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th rows are connected. The '8' digits in the 8th, 9th, and 10th columns are also connected.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    connected = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        normalized = normalize(obj)
        h = height(normalized)
        for p in range(1, h):
            offsetted = shift(normalized, (-p, 0))
            pruned = frozenset({(c, (i, j)) for c, (i, j) in offsetted if i >= 0})
            if pruned.issubset(normalized):
                connected = connected | connect(ulcorner(obj), (lowermost(obj), ulcorner(obj)[1]))
    O = fill(I, EIGHT, connected)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code first identifies all objects (connected components) in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, False, False, True)`.
2. **Iterate and Connect:** It iterates through each object and finds its vertical period. If the object has a vertical period, it connects the topmost and bottommost points of the object with a line.
3. **Fill Grid:** Finally, it fills the input grid `I` with the value `EIGHT` at the connected indices, resulting in the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    connected = mapply(lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), (lowermost(obj), ulcorner(obj)[1])), objs)
    O = fill(I, EIGHT, connected)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, it identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Connect with `mapply`:** Instead of iterating, this version uses `mapply` to efficiently connect the topmost and bottommost points of each object with a line.
3. **Fill Grid:**  It fills the input grid `I` with the value `EIGHT` at the connected indices, producing the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    connected = mfilter(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: height(obj) > 1 and vperiod(obj) < height(obj))
    O = underfill(I, EIGHT, merge(apply(lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), (lowermost(obj), ulcorner(obj)[1])), connected)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter Objects:** This version uses `mfilter` to select only the objects with a height greater than 1 and a vertical period smaller than their height. This ensures that only vertically connected objects are considered.
2. **Connect and Fill:** It connects the top and bottom of each filtered object and then uses `underfill` to fill the input grid `I` with `EIGHT` at the connected indices, producing the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        if height(obj) > 1:
            start = ulcorner(obj)
            end = (lowermost(obj), start[1])
            O = fill(O, EIGHT, connect(start, end))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Connection:** This version iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Conditional Filling:** If an object's height is greater than 1, indicating a vertical connection, it directly fills the input grid with `EIGHT` along the line connecting the top and bottom of the object.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = I
    for j in range(w):
        connected = False
        for i in range(h):
            if I[i][j] != 0:
                if not connected:
                    start = (i, j)
                    connected = True
                else:
                    end = (i, j)
                    O = fill(O, EIGHT, connect(start, end))
                    connected = False
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Column-wise:** This version iterates through each column of the input grid.
2. **Connect within Columns:** It identifies consecutive non-zero values within each column and connects them horizontally by filling the grid with `EIGHT`. 

These are just five different approaches; there may be other valid solutions using the provided DSL. Each version attempts to achieve the desired transformation through different logical steps or function combinations, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL in solving this spatial reasoning task.
