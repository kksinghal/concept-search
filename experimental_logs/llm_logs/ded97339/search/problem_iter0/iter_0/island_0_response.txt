## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending the occurrences of the non-zero digit in the input grid along its row or column, creating a continuous line of that digit until it reaches another non-zero digit or the grid boundary. 

**Let's analyze each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** The single '8' digits in each column are extended horizontally to form a continuous line of '8's.
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:** Similar to Input_0, the '8' digits are extended horizontally. However, the extension stops upon encountering another '8' digit.
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:** The pattern repeats, with '8' digits extended horizontally, stopping at either another '8' or the grid boundary.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_generated(grid):
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    new_grid = [[grid[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if grid[i][j] != 0:
                value = grid[i][j]
                k = j + 1
                while k < w and grid[i][k] == 0:
                    new_grid[i][k] = value
                    k += 1
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a new grid `new_grid` as a copy of the input grid `grid`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterate over each cell in the grid.
3. **Extension:** If a cell contains a non-zero value, extend that value horizontally in `new_grid` until a non-zero value or the grid boundary is reached.
4. **Return:** Return the modified `new_grid`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_generated(grid):
    return tuple(tuple(color(extract(objects(crop(grid, (i, 0), (1, len(grid[0]))), T, F, F), lambda obj: len(obj) > 0))[0] if v != 0 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iteration:** Iterate through each row of the grid.
2. **Object Extraction:** For each row, extract the object containing the non-zero digit.
3. **Color Retrieval:** Obtain the color of the extracted object.
4. **Row Modification:** Replace all zero values in the row with the retrieved color.
5. **Return:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(next((grid[i][k] for k in range(j+1, len(grid[0])) if grid[i][k] != 0), [grid[i][j]])[0] if cell == 0 else cell for j, cell in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iteration:** Iterate over each cell in the grid.
2. **Lookahead:** For each zero cell, search for the next non-zero cell in the same row.
3. **Replacement:** If a non-zero cell is found, replace the zero cell with its value. Otherwise, keep the zero cell as is.
4. **Return:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_generated(grid):
    new_grid = list(list(row) for row in grid)
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != 0:
                for k in range(j + 1, len(row)):
                    if grid[i][k] == 0:
                        new_grid[i][k] = val
                    else:
                        break
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates a mutable copy of the input grid.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each cell of the grid.
3. **Line Extension:** If a non-zero value is encountered, it extends that value to the right until another non-zero value is found.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j]!=0:
                k=j+1
                while k<len(I[0]) and I[i][k] == 0:
                    O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, k))})
                    k+=1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes the output grid 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Painting:** If a non-zero value is found, it iteratively 'paints' that value onto subsequent zero-valued cells in the same row until a non-zero value or the edge of the grid is encountered. 
4. **Return:** Returns the modified output grid. 

These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation while utilizing the provided DSL functions.
