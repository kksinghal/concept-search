## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components) of a specific color (8 in this case) and extending them either horizontally or vertically until they hit another object of the same color. 

**Input_0:** The object on the left side extends horizontally to the right until it hits the other object. The objects on the right side extend vertically downwards until they connect.

**Input_1:** The objects on the left side extend vertically downwards until they hit the object at the bottom. The object at the top remains unchanged. The object at the bottom extends horizontally to the right until it reaches the right edge.

**Input_2:**  The object in the top left corner extends horizontally to the right.  The objects in the middle extend vertically downwards until they connect with the object at the bottom. The object at the bottom extends horizontally to the right. The object in the bottom left corner remains unchanged.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    filled = I
    for obj in objs:
        upper = uppermost(obj)
        lower = lowermost(obj)
        left = leftmost(obj)
        right = rightmost(obj)
        for i in range(upper, lower + 1):
            for j in range(left, right + 1):
                if (i, j) not in toindices(obj):
                    filled = fill(filled, 8, {(i, j)})
    return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We first use the `objects` function to get a set of all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** We iterate through each object and its bounding box. 
3. **Fill Empty Cells:** For every cell within the bounding box not already part of the object, we fill it with color `8`.

**Limitations:** This version might not be the most efficient and doesn't account for edge cases where objects are diagonally connected. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  output = I
  for obj in objs:
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      output = fill(output, 8, hfrontier((i, j)).intersection(backdrop(obj)))
      output = fill(output, 8, vfrontier((i, j)).intersection(backdrop(obj)))
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to version 1, we identify all objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  For each cell within an object, we draw horizontal and vertical lines within the object's bounding box, effectively filling the space.

**Limitations:** This version still relies on bounding boxes and may not be ideal for complex shapes.

## Program Version 3 (More efficient):

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  output = I
  for obj1 in objs:
    for obj2 in objs:
      if obj1 != obj2:
        if hmatching(obj1, obj2):
          upper = min(uppermost(obj1), uppermost(obj2))
          lower = max(lowermost(obj1), lowermost(obj2))
          left = min(leftmost(obj1), leftmost(obj2))
          right = max(rightmost(obj1), rightmost(obj2))
          output = fill(output, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(upper, lower + 1) for j in range(left, right + 1)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, we identify objects in the grid.
2. **Find Matching Objects:** We iterate through pairs of objects and check if they share a row (`hmatching`).
3. **Fill Between Objects:** If they share a row, we find the bounding box encompassing both objects and fill it with the target color (8).

**Limitations:** This version only handles horizontal connections between objects and might need adjustments for vertical connections.

## Program Version 4 (Using `gravitate` function):

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    output = I
    for obj1 in objs:
        for obj2 in objs:
            if obj1 != obj2:
                direction = gravitate(obj1, obj2)
                if direction != (0, 0):
                    path = connect(centerofmass(obj1), add(centerofmass(obj2),invert(direction)))
                    output = fill(output, 8, path)
    return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identify all objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate Gravitation:**  For each pair of distinct objects, calculate the direction one object would "gravitate" towards the other to become adjacent.
3. **Connect Centers:** If gravitation exists, connect the centers of the two objects with a line, effectively filling the gap between them.

**Limitations:**  This version assumes a direct path between object centers and might not be suitable for scenarios with obstacles. 


## Program Version 5 (Combining horizontal and vertical filling):

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  output = I
  for obj1 in objs:
    for obj2 in objs:
      if obj1 != obj2:
        if hmatching(obj1, obj2):
          upper = min(uppermost(obj1), uppermost(obj2))
          lower = max(lowermost(obj1), lowermost(obj2))
          left = min(leftmost(obj1), leftmost(obj2))
          right = max(rightmost(obj1), rightmost(obj2))
          output = fill(output, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(upper, lower + 1) for j in range(left, right + 1)})
        if vmatching(obj1, obj2):
          upper = min(uppermost(obj1), uppermost(obj2))
          lower = max(lowermost(obj1), lowermost(obj2))
          left = min(leftmost(obj1), leftmost(obj2))
          right = max(rightmost(obj1), rightmost(obj2))
          output = fill(output, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(upper, lower + 1) for j in range(left, right + 1)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Check Horizontal and Vertical Matching:** Checks both `hmatching` and `vmatching` to cover both horizontal and vertical connection possibilities.
3. **Fill Between Objects:** If a match is found (either horizontally or vertically), it fills the space between the objects.


These are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code that attempt to solve the given transformation task. Each version leverages different DSL functions and logic, offering varying levels of efficiency and addressing potential limitations.
