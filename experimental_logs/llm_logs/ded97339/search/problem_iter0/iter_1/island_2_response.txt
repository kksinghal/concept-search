## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to follow this logic:

* **Identify objects:** The transformation focuses on objects formed by connected cells of the same color (digit '8' in these examples).
* **Horizontal Expansion:** If an object has more than one cell in a row (horizontally), it expands to fill its entire row in the output.
* **Vertical Expansion:** If an object has more than one cell in a column (vertically), it expands to fill its entire column in the output.

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The object in row 4 expands horizontally, and the objects in column 7 and column 8 expand vertically. 

**Pair 1:** The object in row 7 expands horizontally, and the objects in column 3 and column 8 expand vertically.

**Pair 2:**  The object in row 2 expands horizontally, and the objects in column 2 and column 8 expand vertically.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by `Program_A`'s iterative approach and `Program_B`'s object detection)

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        if any(I[i][k] == 8 for k in range(width(I)) if k != j):
          O = fill(O, 8, {(i, k) for k in range(width(I))})
        if any(I[k][j] == 8 for k in range(height(I)) if k != i):
          O = fill(O, 8, {(k, j) for k in range(height(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through the grid:** Loop through each cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **Check for '8':** If a cell contains '8', check its row and column.
3. **Horizontal Expansion:** If another '8' exists in the same row, fill the entire row with '8' in the output grid `O`.
4. **Vertical Expansion:** If another '8' exists in the same column, fill the entire column with '8' in the output grid `O`.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by `Program_B`'s object-centric logic and `Program_A`'s conditional filling)

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 8:
      if width(obj) > 1:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for j in range(width(I))} )
      if height(obj) > 1:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(height(I))} )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Detection:** Identify all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects` function.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each detected object `obj`.
3. **Check Color and Dimensions:** If the object's color is '8' and its width is greater than 1, fill the corresponding row in the output grid `O` with '8'. Do the same for columns if the height is greater than 1.

**Version 3:** (Leveraging `hmatching` and `vmatching` for efficient neighbor checks)

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  for obj1 in objs:
    if color(obj1) == 8:
      for obj2 in objs:
        if obj1 != obj2 and color(obj2) == 8:
          if hmatching(obj1, obj2):
            O = fill(O, 8, {(uppermost(obj1), j) for j in range(width(I))})
          if vmatching(obj1, obj2):
            O = fill(O, 8, {(i, leftmost(obj1)) for i in range(height(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Detection:** Detect objects in the grid using `objects` function.
2. **Pairwise Comparison:** Iterate through pairs of objects.
3. **Horizontal/Vertical Matching:** Use `hmatching` and `vmatching` to efficiently check if two objects share a row or column. If they do, fill the corresponding row/column with '8' in the output grid.


**Version 4:** (Utilizing `frontiers` function for direct frontier detection)

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  ftrs = frontiers(I)
  for ftr in ftrs:
    if color(ftr) == 8 and len(ftr) > 1:
      if hline(ftr):
        O = fill(O, 8, {(uppermost(ftr), j) for j in range(width(I))})
      elif vline(ftr):
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, leftmost(ftr)) for i in range(height(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Frontier Detection:** Directly detect horizontal and vertical frontiers using the `frontiers` function.
2. **Iterate through Frontiers:** Loop through each detected frontier `ftr`.
3. **Color and Size Check:** If the frontier's color is '8' and its length is greater than 1 (meaning it's not a single cell), check if it's a horizontal or vertical line.
4. **Fill Row/Column:** Fill the corresponding row or column in the output grid `O` with '8'.

**Version 5:** (A more concise approach using set comprehension and `any`)

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  rows = {i for obj in objs for i, j in toindices(obj) if color(obj) == 8 and width(obj) > 1}
  cols = {j for obj in objs for i, j in toindices(obj) if color(obj) == 8 and height(obj) > 1}
  return tuple(
    tuple(8 if i in rows or j in cols else I[i][j] for j in range(width(I))) 
    for i in range(height(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Detection:**  Detect objects using `objects` function.
2. **Identify Rows/Columns:** Using set comprehension, efficiently identify rows and columns that need to be filled by checking if any object within them has color '8' and  width/height greater than 1.
3. **Construct Output:** Construct the output grid directly by checking if each cell belongs to identified rows or columns and filling it with '8' if it does. Otherwise, retain the original value from the input grid.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to solving the transformation problem using different DSL functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
