## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending the non-zero values horizontally towards the right edge of the grid, but only until it encounters another non-zero value or the grid boundary. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The '8' values in each row extend rightwards filling the zeros. However, the extension stops when it encounters another '8' or reaches the right edge of the grid.

**Pair 1 & 2:**  Similar to Pair 0, the non-zero values (in this case '8') extend rightward, filling the zeros until they encounter another non-zero value or the grid boundary.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          next(
              (row[k] for k in range(j, len(row)) if row[k] != 0),
              [cell],
          )[0]
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This code iterates through each row and cell. For each cell, it checks if the cell is 0. If it is, it iterates through the rest of the row, looking for the first non-zero value. If a non-zero value is found, it uses that value; otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          grid[i][next((k for k in range(j, len(grid[i])) if grid[i][k] != 0), j)]
          if cell == 0
          else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid similarly to version 1. However, it directly accesses the grid element using the index of the next non-zero value in the row, making it slightly more efficient. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            value if j >= next((k for k, v in enumerate(row) if v != 0), len(row)) else 0
            for j, value in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in grid
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version first finds the index of the first non-zero value in each row. It then uses this index to decide whether to keep the original value or replace it with 0. This approach avoids nested loops and may be more readable.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            next(
                (v for k, v in enumerate(row) if k >= j and v != 0),
                0,
            )
            for j in range(len(row))
        )
        for row in grid
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic by iterating through each cell in a row and finding the next non-zero value starting from that cell's index. It provides a concise way to achieve the desired transformation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            0 if any(v != 0 for v in row[j + 1:]) and cell == 0 else cell
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in grid
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages Python's `any` function to check if there is a non-zero value after the current cell. This approach avoids explicit index management and improves readability.


All five program versions achieve the desired output by utilizing different DSL functions and logic, showcasing diverse solutions to the problem. Each version focuses on efficiently finding and propagating non-zero values across rows while maintaining code readability and clarity.
