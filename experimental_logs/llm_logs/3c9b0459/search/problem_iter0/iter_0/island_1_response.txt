## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation rotates the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. 

**Example:**

Input_0:
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1 
```

Output_0:
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return rot270(grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `rot270` function from the DSL to directly perform a 270-degree rotation on the input grid. Since rotating counterclockwise by 90 degrees is the same as rotating clockwise by 270 degrees, this achieves the desired transformation.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return tuple(zip(*grid[::-1]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly implements the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation logic using Python's built-in functions within the DSL constraints. 

1. `grid[::-1]` reverses the order of rows, effectively flipping the grid vertically. 
2. `zip(*grid[::-1])` transposes the vertically flipped grid, resulting in a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.
3. `tuple()` converts the resulting transposed grid into a tuple, matching the DSL's Grid type.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return hmirror(rot90(hmirror(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a combination of mirroring and rotation to achieve the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

1. `hmirror(grid)` performs a horizontal mirror reflection of the grid.
2. `rot90(...)` rotates the horizontally mirrored grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3. `hmirror(...)` performs another horizontal mirror reflection on the rotated grid.

This sequence of operations results in a net 90-degree counterclockwise rotation of the original input grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return vmirror(rot270(vmirror(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to version 3, this version utilizes mirroring and rotation but with a different combination.

1. `vmirror(grid)` performs a vertical mirror reflection of the grid.
2. `rot270(...)` rotates the vertically mirrored grid 270 degrees clockwise (equivalent to 90 degrees counterclockwise).
3. `vmirror(...)` performs another vertical mirror reflection on the rotated grid.

This sequence also results in a net 90-degree counterclockwise rotation of the original grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(grid):
    new_grid = []
    for j in range(len(grid[0])):
        row = []
        for i in range(len(grid)-1,-1,-1):
            row.append(grid[i][j])
        new_grid.append(tuple(row))
    return tuple(new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid column-wise and constructs a new grid by reversing each column and appending it as a row. This process directly achieves a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

1.  It initializes an empty list `new_grid` to store the rotated grid.
2.  It iterates through each column `j` of the input grid.
3.  For each column `j`, it creates an empty list `row` to store the elements of that column.
4.  It then iterates through each row `i` of the input grid in reverse order (from the last row to the first).
5.  For each `i` and `j`, it retrieves the element at position `grid[i][j]` and appends it to the `row` list.
6.  After processing all rows in reverse order for column `j`, the `row` list will contain the elements of column `j` in reversed order. This `row` is then converted into a tuple and appended to the `new_grid`.
7.  This process is repeated for each column, effectively rotating the grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.
8.  Finally, the `new_grid` is converted into a tuple before being returned.

All five versions achieve the same 90-degree counterclockwise rotation of the input grid, but they demonstrate different approaches and function combinations possible within the DSL.
