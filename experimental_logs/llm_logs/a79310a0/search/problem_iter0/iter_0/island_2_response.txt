## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '8' in the input grid and then shifting those objects downwards by a specific offset. The offset seems to be related to the object's initial position.

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The object of '8's is shifted down by two rows.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** The object of '8's is shifted down by one row.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** The object of '8's is shifted down by two rows. 

This suggests the offset is likely linked to the uppermost row occupied by the object. Additionally, all '8's are replaced with '2's in the output. 


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), I)  # Identify the object formed by '8's
  offset = (uppermost(obj) * 2, 0)   # Calculate the downward shift based on the object's uppermost row
  shifted_obj = shift(obj, offset)     # Apply the shift to the object
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shifted_obj)  # Create a blank canvas and paint the shifted object
  return replace(O, EIGHT, TWO)     # Replace '8's with '2's in the output grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Locate the '8's in the grid and convert them into an object representation.
2. **Calculate the offset:** Determine the shift amount by multiplying the uppermost row index of the object by 2.
3. **Apply the shift:** Move the object downwards according to the calculated offset.
4. **Create and paint on a blank canvas:** Generate an empty grid of the same size as the input filled with '0's and paint the shifted object onto it.
5. **Replace '8's with '2's:** Substitute all occurrences of '8' with '2' in the final output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False) # Extract objects
  shifted_objs = frozenset({shift(obj, (uppermost(obj) * 2, 0)) for obj in objs if color(obj) == EIGHT}) # Shift objects formed by '8's
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs)) # Create a blank canvas and paint shifted objects
  return replace(O, EIGHT, TWO) # Replace '8's with '2's
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Identify all distinct objects present in the input grid.
2. **Shift '8' objects:** Iterate through the objects, calculate the offset for objects made of '8's, and shift them accordingly. 
3. **Paint on a blank canvas:** Similar to version 1, create a blank grid and paint the shifted objects onto it.
4. **Replace '8's with '2's:**  Substitute '8's with '2's in the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return replace(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), I), (2 * uppermost(ofcolor(I, EIGHT)), 0))), EIGHT, TWO)
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines multiple operations into a single line for conciseness. It follows the same logic as the previous versions but with a more compact structure.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == EIGHT:
      O = move(O, obj, (uppermost(obj) * 2, 0))
  return replace(O, EIGHT, TWO)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and move:** This version iterates through each object in the input. If an object is made of '8's, it moves the object on the grid using the `move` function.
2. **Replace '8's:** After moving all relevant objects, it replaces '8's with '2's in the resulting grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def shift_down(obj):
    return shift(obj, (uppermost(obj) * 2, 0)) if color(obj) == EIGHT else obj
  return replace(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(apply(shift_down, objects(I, True, False, False)))), EIGHT, TWO)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a helper function `shift_down` to encapsulate the conditional shifting logic for each object. It applies this function to all objects in the grid before painting them onto a blank canvas and performing the final color replacement.

These five distinct programs demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the target transformation while adhering to the provided DSL. Each version employs different combinations of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the given DSL.
