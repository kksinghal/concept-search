## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the two foreground objects in the grid (objects other than the background color) and moving them until they collide with another object or a grid boundary. The objects swap colors during this process.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. The top object (color 6) moves down until it hits the bottom object (color 8).
2. The bottom object (color 8) moves up until it hits the top object (color 6).
3. The colors of the moved objects are swapped: the top object becomes color 8, and the bottom object becomes color 2.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. The top object (color 1) moves down until it hits the bottom object (color 4).
2. The bottom object (color 4) moves up until it hits the top object (color 1).
3. The colors of the moved objects are swapped: the top object becomes color 4, and the bottom object becomes color 1.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

1. The top object (color 1) moves down until it hits the bottom object (color 6).
2. The bottom object (color 6) moves up until it hits the top object (color 1).
3. The colors of the moved objects are swapped: the top object becomes color 6, and the bottom object becomes color 1.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj1, obj2 = order(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: uppermost(obj))[0:2]
  
  def move_until_collision(obj, direction):
    grid_indices = asindices(I)
    while not intersection(toindices(shift(obj, direction)), difference(grid_indices, toindices(obj))):
      obj = shift(obj, direction)
    return obj
  
  moved_obj1 = move_until_collision(obj1, DOWN)
  moved_obj2 = move_until_collision(obj2, UP)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                  recolor(color(obj2), moved_obj1)), 
                  recolor(color(obj1), moved_obj2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identifies objects:** Extracts the two foreground objects and orders them based on their vertical position.
2. **`move_until_collision` function:** Defines a function that iteratively shifts an object in a given direction until it collides with another object or a grid boundary. 
3. **Moves objects:** Moves the top object down and the bottom object up until collision.
4. **Swaps colors:** Paints a blank canvas with the background color, then paints the moved objects with swapped colors.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj1, obj2 = order(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: uppermost(obj))[0:2]

  def find_collision_point(obj, direction):
    for i in range(1, max(height(I), width(I))):
      if intersection(toindices(shift(obj, multiply(direction, i))), difference(asindices(I), toindices(obj))):
        return subtract(multiply(direction, i), direction)
    return (0, 0)  

  moved_obj1 = shift(obj1, find_collision_point(obj1, DOWN))
  moved_obj2 = shift(obj2, find_collision_point(obj2, UP))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                  recolor(color(obj2), moved_obj1)), 
                  recolor(color(obj1), moved_obj2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identifies objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **`find_collision_point` function:**  This function calculates the offset to move an object to reach the point of collision. It iterates through increasing offsets and checks for intersection with other objects or boundaries.
3. **Moves objects:**  Calculates the collision offset and shifts the objects directly to their final positions.
4. **Swaps colors:**  Similar to version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj1, obj2 = order(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: uppermost(obj))[0:2]

  def get_collision_offset(obj, direction):
    offset = (0, 0)
    while not intersection(toindices(shift(obj, offset)), difference(asindices(I), toindices(obj))):
      offset = add(offset, direction)
    return offset

  moved_obj1 = shift(obj1, get_collision_offset(obj1, DOWN))
  moved_obj2 = shift(obj2, get_collision_offset(obj2, UP))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), moved_obj1)
  O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj1), moved_obj2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identifies objects:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **`get_collision_offset` function:** Calculates the offset for collision by iteratively incrementing it until an intersection is detected.
3. **Moves objects:** Directly shifts objects using the calculated offsets.
4. **Swaps colors:** Paints the canvas, then paints the moved objects one by one with swapped colors.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  def move_and_paint(obj, target_color, direction):
    shifted = shift(obj, direction)
    while not intersection(toindices(shifted), difference(asindices(I), toindices(obj))):
      obj = shifted
      shifted = shift(obj, direction)
    return paint(I, recolor(target_color, obj))

  obj1, obj2 = order(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: uppermost(obj))[0:2]
  O = move_and_paint(obj1, color(obj2), DOWN)
  O = move_and_paint(obj2, color(obj1), UP)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_and_paint` function:** Combines object movement and painting into a single function. It takes the object, its target color, and the movement direction as input. It iteratively moves the object and paints it with the target color once a collision is detected.
2. **Identifies objects:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Moves and paints:**  Calls `move_and_paint` for each object with the other object's color and the appropriate direction.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj1, obj2 = order(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: uppermost(obj))[0:2]

  def move_till_blocked(obj, direction):
    next_pos = shift(obj, direction)
    while not intersection(toindices(next_pos), difference(asindices(I), toindices(obj))):
      obj = next_pos
      next_pos = shift(obj, direction)
    return obj

  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(color(obj2), move_till_blocked(obj1, DOWN)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj1), move_till_blocked(obj2, UP)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identifies objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **`move_till_blocked` function:** Defines a function to move an object in a given direction until blocked by another object or a grid boundary.
3. **Moves and paints:** Moves each object, recolors it with the other object's color, and paints it onto a blank canvas initialized with the background color. 

Each program version implements the same core logic for object movement and color swapping, but they differ in how they structure the code and utilize DSL functions, leading to five distinct solutions.
