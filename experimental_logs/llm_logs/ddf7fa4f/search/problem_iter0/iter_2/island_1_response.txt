## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in the input-output pairs can be described as **color-based object movement with color replacement**:

1. **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains multiple objects, each identified by a unique color (digit).
2. **Target Location:** Each object has a specific target location relative to its original position. This location seems to depend on the object's color.
3. **Movement & Replacement:** The objects move to their target locations, and their color is replaced with a different color. The replacement color also appears to be determined by the original color.

**Specific Observations:**

- Objects with color `5` are replaced with color `6`.
- Objects with color `8` are replaced with color `8`.
- Objects with color `2` are replaced with color `2`.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    color_ = color(obj)
    new_color = {2: 2, 5: 6, 8: 8}.get(color_, color_)  # Color mapping
    new_obj = recolor(new_color, obj) 
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), new_obj)  # Move and replace color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Transform:** The code iterates through each object `obj`.
3. **Color Mapping:** A dictionary maps original colors to new colors. If an object's color is not found in the mapping, it retains its original color.
4. **Movement and Replacement:**  The object `obj` is moved and its color is replaced with the `new_color` using a combination of `recolor`, `cover`, and `paint` functions. 

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for original_color, new_color in [(2, 2), (5, 6), (8, 8)]:  # Color mapping as tuples
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), original_color), frozenset())
    if obj:
        new_obj = recolor(new_color, obj)
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through a list of (original_color, new_color) tuples.
- It uses `colorfilter` to find objects of a specific `original_color`.
- If an object with the `original_color` is found, it's moved and recolored similar to Version 1.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color_map = {2: 2, 5: 6, 8: 8} # Color mapping as a dictionary
  return totuple(tuple(
    tuple(color_map.get(v, v) if v != 0 else 0 for v in r) 
    for r in I
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses a more concise approach by iterating directly over the grid cells and using a dictionary `color_map` to recolor the objects based on their values.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    original_color = color(obj)
    new_color = {2: 2, 5: 6, 8: 8}.get(original_color, original_color)
    return recolor(new_color, obj)

  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  transformed_objs = apply(transform_object, objs)  # Apply transformation to each object
  O = I
  for obj in transformed_objs:
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines a separate function `transform_object` to handle the color mapping and recoloring of individual objects. 
- It uses the `apply` function to apply this transformation to all identified objects.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def new_color(v): 
    return {2: 2, 5: 6, 8: 8}.get(v, v)
  return totuple(tuple(
    tuple(branch(v != 0, new_color(v), 0) for v in r)
    for r in I
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version simplifies the code by using the `branch` function to apply the color mapping only to non-background cells (cells with value not equal to 0).
- It defines a function `new_color` for a cleaner color mapping logic.

These are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated"  Each uses different DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired transformation. You can choose the version that you find most readable and efficient.
