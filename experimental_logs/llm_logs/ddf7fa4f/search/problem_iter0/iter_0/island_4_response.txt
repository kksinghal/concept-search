## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic for all input-output pairs involves identifying object pairs based on their unique colors (excluding the background color 0) and then swapping the positions of these object pairs. 

Let's break it down for each example:

**Example 0:**

* **Input:** Two objects with colors 2 and 5, and another object with color 8.
* **Output:**  The positions of objects with colors 2 and 5 are swapped.

**Example 1:**

* **Input:** Two objects with colors 1 and 7, and another object with color 4.
* **Output:**  The positions of objects with colors 1 and 7 are swapped.

**Example 2:**

* **Input:** Three objects with colors 1, 6, and 7.
* **Output:**  The positions of objects with colors 1 and 7 are swapped.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  colors =  palette(objs)-{mostcommon(I)}
  obj1 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj)==first(colors)) 
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj)==last(colors))
  O = paint(paint(I, recolor(color(obj2),toindices(obj1))),recolor(color(obj1),toindices(obj2)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Colors:** Identify all objects in the input grid (excluding the background) and extract the unique colors present.
2. **Extract Objects to Swap:**  Extract the two objects corresponding to the unique colors identified.
3. **Swap Colors and Paint:** Swap the colors of the extracted objects and paint them back onto the input grid, effectively swapping their positions.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  c1, c2 = totuple(palette(objs) - {mostcommon(I)})
  p1 = toindices(extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == c1))
  p2 = toindices(extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == c2))
  O = paint(fill(fill(I, c2, p1), c1, p2), asobject(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Colors:**  Similar to Version 1, identify objects and their unique colors.
2. **Extract Indices and Colors:** Extract the indices of cells belonging to each unique object and store their colors.
3. **Fill and Paint:** Fill the indices of the first object with the second object's color and vice-versa. Then, paint the original objects back onto the grid to ensure correct color representation.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    o = objects(I, T, T, T)
    c = sorted(palette(o) - {mostcommon(I)})
    g = I
    for i in range(len(c) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(c)):
            p1 = toindices(extract(o, lambda obj: color(obj) == c[i]))
            p2 = toindices(extract(o, lambda obj: color(obj) == c[j]))
            g = paint(fill(fill(g, c[j], p1), c[i], p2), asobject(I))
    O = g
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Colors:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Swap:** Iterate through pairs of unique colors. For each pair, extract the indices of corresponding objects and swap their colors using fill and paint operations. This version generalizes to swapping multiple objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I,T,T,T)
    color_mapping = {}
    for obj in objs:
        c = color(obj)
        if c != mostcommon(I):
            color_mapping[c] = other(color_mapping,c) if c in color_mapping else other(palette(objs)-{mostcommon(I)},c)
    O = paint(I, frozenset((color_mapping.get(v,v), i) for v, i in asobject(I)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Colors:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create Color Mapping:** Create a dictionary mapping each unique color to the other unique color (its swapping partner).
3. **Apply Mapping and Paint:**  Iterate through all cells in the grid, replacing their color based on the mapping if applicable, effectively swapping object colors and thus their positions.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  o = objects(I,T,T,T)
  c = sorted(palette(o)-{mostcommon(I)})
  obj = tuple(extract(o,lambda obj: color(obj)==i) for i in c)
  g = I
  for i in range(len(obj)//2):
    g = paint(paint(g,recolor(color(obj[len(obj)-i-1]),toindices(obj[i]))),recolor(color(obj[i]),toindices(obj[len(obj)-i-1])))
  O = g
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Colors:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Sort and Extract Objects:** Sort the unique colors and extract corresponding objects in that order.
3. **Pairwise Swapping:** Iterate through pairs of objects from the beginning and end of the sorted list, swapping their colors and painting them back onto the grid. This version also generalizes to swapping multiple objects.


These programs demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation while utilizing the provided DSL functions. They showcase the flexibility and power of this DSL in manipulating spatial data and solving visual reasoning problems.
