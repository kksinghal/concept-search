## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes each distinct non-background object in the input grid, duplicates it, and then moves both the original and the duplicate. The specific movements are as follows:

* **Object 1:** Moves downwards until it hits another object or the bottom of the grid.
* **Object 2:** Moves upwards until it hits another object or the top of the grid.

This pattern holds true for all three input-output pairs provided.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  obj1 = first(objs)
  obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
  
  def move_down(obj):
    while lowermost(obj) < height(I) - 1 and not any(index(I, add(loc, DOWN)) for loc in toindices(obj)):
      obj = shift(obj, DOWN)
    return obj

  def move_up(obj):
    while uppermost(obj) > 0 and not any(index(I, add(loc, UP)) for loc in toindices(obj)):
      obj = shift(obj, UP)
    return obj

  moved_obj1 = move_down(obj1)
  moved_obj2 = move_up(obj2)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), moved_obj1), moved_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We first get a set of all non-background objects using `fgpartition(I)`.
2. **Separate Objects:** We then extract the two objects into `obj1` and `obj2`.
3. **Define Movement Functions:** `move_down` and `move_up` functions are defined to repeatedly shift an object down or up until it encounters another object or a grid boundary.
4. **Apply Movements:** Apply the movement functions to the objects.
5. **Construct Output:** Create a blank canvas using `canvas` and paint the moved objects onto it using `paint`. 


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = order(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: uppermost(obj))
  obj1, obj2 = objs

  def move_until_collision(obj, direction):
    while True:
      next_locs = apply(lambda loc: add(loc, direction), toindices(obj))
      if any(index(I, loc) not in (None, mostcolor(I)) for loc in next_locs):
        break
      obj = shift(obj, direction)
    return obj

  moved_obj1 = move_until_collision(obj1, DOWN)
  moved_obj2 = move_until_collision(obj2, UP)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), moved_obj1), moved_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Order Objects:**  We obtain non-background objects using `fgpartition` and order them by their uppermost row (`uppermost`).
2. **Define Movement Function:**  A single `move_until_collision` function handles both upward and downward movement using a `direction` parameter.
3. **Apply Movements:** Apply the movement function to both objects with appropriate directions.
4. **Construct Output:**  Create a blank canvas and paint the moved objects onto it.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = argmax(fgpartition(I), size)
  obj2 = other(fgpartition(I), obj1)

  def move_gravity(obj, target):
    return shift(obj, gravitate(obj, target))

  moved_obj1 = move_gravity(obj1, toindices(bottomhalf(I)))
  moved_obj2 = move_gravity(obj2, toindices(tophalf(I)))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), moved_obj1), moved_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find the largest object by size using `argmax` and assume it's the one moving down. The other object moves up.
2. **Define Movement Function:** The `move_gravity` function uses the `gravitate` function to calculate the direction and magnitude of movement required to bring an object adjacent to a target.
3. **Apply Movements:** The `move_gravity` function is applied, moving the first object towards the bottom half of the grid and the second towards the top.
4. **Construct Output:** Create a blank canvas and paint the moved objects.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  obj1 = argmax(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj)) 
  obj2 = other(objs, obj1)

  def move_to_edge(obj, edge_func):
    while not any(loc in toindices(edge_func(I)) for loc in toindices(obj)):
      obj = shift(obj, position(obj, edge_func(I)))
    return obj

  moved_obj1 = move_to_edge(obj1, bottomhalf)
  moved_obj2 = move_to_edge(obj2, tophalf)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), moved_obj1), moved_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, we identify the objects and distinguish them based on their vertical positioning.
2. **Define Movement Function:** `move_to_edge` iteratively shifts the object using the `position` function to determine the direction towards the target edge, defined by the `edge_func`.
3. **Apply Movements:**  The `move_to_edge` function is applied, guiding one object to the bottom half and the other to the top.
4. **Construct Output:** A blank canvas is created, and the moved objects are painted onto it.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = argmin(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[0])
  obj2 = other(fgpartition(I), obj1)

  def vertical_slide(obj, direction):
    while any(0 <= add(loc, direction)[0] < height(I) and index(I, add(loc, direction)) == mostcolor(I) for loc in toindices(obj)):
      obj = shift(obj, direction)
    return obj

  moved_obj1 = vertical_slide(obj1, DOWN)
  moved_obj2 = vertical_slide(obj2, UP)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), moved_obj1), moved_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify the object closest to the top of the grid using `argmin` and `centerofmass` as the primary object. The other object is identified subsequently.
2. **Define Movement Function:** The `vertical_slide` function iteratively moves the object up or down as long as the next position in that direction is within the grid bounds and is occupied by the background color.
3. **Apply Movements:**  The `vertical_slide` function is applied to both objects with the appropriate directions.
4. **Construct Output:** A blank canvas is created, and the moved objects are painted onto it.

These five program versions all achieve the desired transformation through different logical approaches and DSL function combinations. They highlight the versatility of the DSL and the diverse ways to solve a given problem.
