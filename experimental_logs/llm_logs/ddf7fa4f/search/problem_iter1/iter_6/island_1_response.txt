## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves swapping the colors of specific objects in the grid based on their relative positions. The objects to be swapped are determined by their colors in the input grid. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0:**

- **Objects:** Two main objects - one formed by '5's and the other by '8's.
- **Transformation:** The color '5' is replaced with '6', and color '8' is replaced with '8'. Subsequently, the initial '6' is replaced with '2'.

**Input_1:**

- **Objects:** Two main objects - one formed by '5's and the other by '7's.
- **Transformation:**  The color '5' is replaced with '1', and color '7' is replaced with '7'. Subsequently, the initial '1' is replaced with '4'.

**Input_2:**

- **Objects:** Three main objects - one formed by '1's, the second by '5's, and the third by '7's.
- **Transformation:** The color '5' is replaced with '1', and color '7' is replaced with '7'. Subsequently, the initial '1' is replaced with '6'.

Essentially, the transformation finds two or three distinct objects (excluding the background '0'), recolors them in a specific order, and potentially recolors one of the objects again to achieve the final output.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True)
  obj1 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != mostcommon(I))
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: obj != obj1)
  color1 = color(obj1)
  color2 = color(obj2)
  return replace(replace(replace(I, color1, -1), color2, color1), -1, color2)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, False, True, True)` extracts objects from the input grid `I`, considering diagonals and excluding the background.
2. **Isolate Objects:**  `extract` finds the first object that doesn't have the most common color (background) and stores it in `obj1`. Then, it finds the second object different from `obj1` and stores it in `obj2`.
3. **Extract Colors:** `color(obj1)` and `color(obj2)` get the colors of the two objects.
4. **Recolor:** The code then performs a three-step replacement:
   - Replace the color of `obj1` with a temporary color (-1).
   - Replace the color of `obj2` with the color of `obj1`.
   - Replace the temporary color (-1) with the color of `obj2`.

This effectively swaps the colors of the two identified objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  p = palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}
  color1 = first(p)
  color2 = other(p, color1)
  return replace(replace(replace(I, color1, -1), color2, color1), -1, color2) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Colors:** `palette(I)` extracts all colors from the grid. `mostcolor(I)` identifies the background color.  Subtracting the background color from the palette leaves us with the colors of the objects we want to swap.
2. **Assign Colors:** `first(p)` takes the first color from the remaining palette and assigns it to `color1`. `other(p, color1)` finds the other (and last) color in the palette and assigns it to `color2`.
3. **Recolor:**  Similar to version 1, this part performs a three-step replacement to swap `color1` and `color2` in the grid.

This version avoids explicitly finding objects and instead focuses on color swapping.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    obj1 = argmax(objs, size)
    obj2 = argmin(objs, size)
    return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(color(obj2), toindices(obj1))), recolor(color(obj1), toindices(obj2)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` separates the input grid into distinct objects, excluding the background.
2. **Find Largest and Smallest:** `argmax(objs, size)` finds the largest object by size, while `argmin(objs, size)` finds the smallest.
3. **Create Blank Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` generates a blank grid filled with the background color and the same dimensions as the input.
4. **Paint and Swap:**
   - The code paints the largest object (`obj1`) onto the blank canvas with the color of the smallest object (`obj2`) using `recolor(color(obj2), toindices(obj1))`.
   - Then, it paints the smallest object (`obj2`) onto the canvas with the color of the largest object (`obj1`) using `recolor(color(obj1), toindices(obj2))`.

This version leverages a blank canvas and repainting to achieve the color swap.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, False, True, True), key=size)
  return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(color(objs[-1]), toindices(objs[0]))), recolor(color(objs[0]), toindices(objs[-1])))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Sort Objects:** `objects(I, False, True, True)` extracts objects, and `sorted(..., key=size)` sorts them by size.
2. **Create Blank Canvas:** `canvas(...)` generates a blank grid.
3. **Paint and Swap:** The code paints and swaps the colors of the smallest (`objs[0]`) and largest (`objs[-1]`) objects directly onto the blank canvas, effectively swapping their colors in the output.

This version simplifies the object selection process by directly sorting them.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = list(filter(lambda x: size(x) > 1, objects(I, False, True, True)))
  return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(color(objs[1]), toindices(objs[0]))), recolor(color(objs[0]), toindices(objs[1])))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter Objects:** `objects(...)` extracts objects, and `filter(lambda x: size(x) > 1, ...)` keeps only objects with more than one cell.
2. **Create Blank Canvas:** `canvas(...)` generates a blank grid.
3. **Paint and Swap:**  This part paints and swaps the colors of the first two identified objects (excluding single-cell objects) directly onto the blank canvas.

This version focuses on objects larger than one cell and simplifies the swapping logic.

These five programs represent different approaches to achieve the desired color swapping transformation. Each version leverages various DSL functions and logic, showcasing diverse solutions to the problem.
