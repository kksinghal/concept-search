## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation swaps the colors of the second smallest and second largest objects in the input grid, while preserving the positions and colors of all other objects.

**Example:**

* **Input_0:** The second smallest object is the '2's and the second largest is the '6's. The transformation swaps their colors, resulting in '2's becoming '6's and vice versa.

* **Input_1:** The second smallest object is the '1's and the second largest is the '7's. They swap colors.

* **Input_2:** The second smallest object is the '1's and the second largest is the '7's. They swap colors.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  objs_sorted = order(objs, size)
  second_smallest = objs_sorted[1]
  second_largest = objs_sorted[-2]
  color_a = color(second_smallest)
  color_b = color(second_largest)
  return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(color_a, toindices(second_largest))), recolor(color_b, toindices(second_smallest)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract all foreground objects from the input grid `I` using `fgpartition`.
2. **Sort Objects:** Sort the objects based on their size using `order` and `size`.
3. **Select Objects:** Retrieve the second smallest and second largest objects from the sorted list.
4. **Swap Colors:** Extract the colors of the selected objects and recolor them on a blank canvas using `recolor`, `toindices`, and `paint`. 
5. **Return:** Return the transformed grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = order(fgpartition(I), size)
  a, b = objs[1], objs[-2]
  grid = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), a)
  return paint(replace(grid, color(a), color(b)), replace(I, color(b), color(a)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Sort:** Extract and sort foreground objects by size.
2. **Select Objects:** Assign the second smallest and second largest objects to `a` and `b`.
3. **Partial Paint:** Paint object `a` onto a blank canvas.
4. **Swap & Paint:** Swap the colors of `a` and `b` in the original grid `I`. Then, overlay this swapped grid onto the canvas containing only object `a`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  s = lambda x: size(extract(objs, matcher(color, x)))
  a, b = sorted(palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}, key=s)[1:3]
  return paint(paint(replace(I, a, -1), recolor(b, ofcolor(I, a))), recolor(a, ofcolor(I, b)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract foreground objects and their colors.
2. **Find Target Colors:** Use a lambda function `s` to find the size of each color object and then sort the colors based on their sizes. Extract the second and third smallest color values.
3. **Replace and Paint:** Replace the second smallest color with a temporary value '-1'. Then paint the second largest color at the locations of the temporary value. Finally, recolor the locations of the second largest color with the second smallest color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = order(fgpartition(I), size)
  a, b = objs[1], objs[-2]
  ca, cb = color(a), color(b)
  return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(cb, difference(toindices(a), toindices(b)))), recolor(ca, difference(toindices(b), toindices(a))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Sort:** Extract foreground objects and sort by size.
2. **Select Objects & Colors:** Assign the second smallest and second largest objects and their colors to `a`, `b` and `ca`, `cb`.
3. **Difference & Paint:**  Find the indices that are unique to each object (`a` and `b`). Recolor and paint these unique indices on a blank canvas with the swapped color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  sizes = apply(size, objs)
  sorted_sizes = order(sizes, identity)
  second_smallest_size = sorted_sizes[1]
  second_largest_size = sorted_sizes[-2]
  second_smallest = extract(objs, matcher(size, second_smallest_size))
  second_largest = extract(objs, matcher(size, second_largest_size))
  return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(color(second_smallest), toindices(second_largest))), recolor(color(second_largest), toindices(second_smallest)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract foreground objects.
2. **Sizes & Sorting:** Calculate the size of each object and sort these sizes.
3. **Find Objects:**  Find the second smallest and largest objects based on their sizes.
4. **Swap & Paint:** Extract their colors and paint them on a blank canvas with swapped colors.


These are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the required transformation. Each version utilizes different DSL functions and approaches to achieve the same result, showcasing diverse solutions.
