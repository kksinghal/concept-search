## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

* Identify objects made of the same digit (consider diagonals).
* Swap the positions of the "2" object and the "8" object.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

* Identify objects made of the same digit (consider diagonals).
* Swap the positions of the "1" object and the "7" object.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**

* Identify objects made of the same digit (consider diagonals).
* Swap the positions of the "1" object and the "7" object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, F), ONE))
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, F), SEVEN))
  O = paint(paint(cover(cover(I, obj1), obj2), shift(obj2, ulcorner(obj1))), shift(obj1, ulcorner(obj2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the objects consisting of "1" (obj1) and "7" (obj2).
2.  **Clear Positions:** Remove both objects from the input grid (I).
3.  **Swap Positions:**  
    *   Paint "7" (obj2) at the upper-left corner of where "1" (obj1) used to be.
    *   Paint "1" (obj1) at the upper-left corner of where "7" (obj2) used to be.
4.  **Return:** The modified grid (O) with the swapped objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
  obj1 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == SEVEN)
  p1 = ulcorner(obj1)
  p2 = ulcorner(obj2)
  O = move(move(I, obj1, subtract(p2, p1)), obj2, subtract(p1, p2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:**  Find all objects in the grid, then extract the objects made of "1" and "7".
2.  **Get Upper-Left Corners:** Obtain the coordinates of the upper-left corners (p1, p2) of both objects.
3.  **Calculate Offsets:** Determine the offsets needed to move each object to the other's position.
4.  **Move Objects:** Use the `move` function twice to swap the positions of the two objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, F), ONE)))
  seven_indices = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, F), SEVEN)))
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if (i, j) in one_indices:
        O = fill(O, SEVEN, {(i, j)})
      elif (i, j) in seven_indices:
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Get Object Indices:** Find the indices of cells belonging to the "1" and "7" objects.
2.  **Iterate and Swap:**  Iterate through the grid cell by cell. If a cell belongs to the "1" object, replace it with "7", and vice versa.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, F), ONE))
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, F), SEVEN))
  grid_without_1 = cover(I, obj1)
  grid_without_1_and_7 = cover(grid_without_1, obj2)
  grid_with_7_at_1 = paint(grid_without_1_and_7, shift(obj2, subtract(ulcorner(obj1), ulcorner(obj2))))
  O = paint(grid_with_7_at_1, shift(obj1, subtract(ulcorner(obj2), ulcorner(obj1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, identify the objects composed of "1" and "7."
2. **Remove Objects:** Sequentially remove the "1" object and then the "7" object from the grid.
3. **Place '7' at '1' Location:** Paint the "7" object onto the grid, offsetting its position to match the original location of the "1" object.
4. **Place '1' at '7' Location:** Similarly, paint the "1" object at the original location of the "7" object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, F), ONE))
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, F), SEVEN))
  temp_color = maximum(palette(I)) + 1
  O = paint(paint(paint(cover(cover(I, obj1), obj2), shift(obj2, ulcorner(obj1))), shift(obj1, ulcorner(obj2))), recolor(temp_color, shift(obj1, ulcorner(obj2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Locate the objects formed by the digits "1" and "7."
2. **Choose Temporary Color:** Select a temporary color that doesn't exist in the grid (maximum color + 1).
3. **Swap and Recolor:**
    * Clear the positions of both the "1" and "7" objects in the grid.
    * Paint the "7" object at the original location of the "1" object.
    * Paint the "1" object at the original location of the "7" object. However, paint it using the temporary color.
4. **Return:** The output grid now contains the swapped objects, with the "1" object temporarily colored. This unusual step might be intended for a specific visual effect or as part of a larger transformation sequence where this color will be addressed later.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to object swapping within the grid, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL and offering different strategies to potentially improve efficiency or handle variations in input grids.
