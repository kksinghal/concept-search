## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The transformation identifies the object formed by digit '2' and creates a horizontally mirrored copy of it. 
- This mirrored object is then shifted downwards until it aligns with the bottom of the original '2' object.
- Finally, the object formed by digit '8' is also copied and shifted downwards until it aligns with the bottom of the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The object formed by digit '1' is duplicated and the new copy is shifted downwards to align with the bottom of the original '1' object.
- The object formed by digit '7' undergoes a similar transformation, being duplicated and shifted upwards to align with the top of the original '7' object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- The object formed by digit '1' is duplicated, and the copy is shifted downwards to align with the bottom of the original '1' object.
- Additionally, the object formed by digit '7' is also duplicated and shifted upwards to align with the top of the original '7' object, but only if the '7' object is not directly adjacent to the '1' object.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj1 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)
    obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 7), I)
    h = height(obj1)
    obj1_shifted = shift(obj1, (h, 0))
    condition = adjacent(obj1, obj2)
    obj2_shifted = branch(condition, obj2, shift(obj2, (-height(obj2), 0)))
    O = paint(paint(I, obj1_shifted), obj2_shifted)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Find the indices of digits '1' and '7' and convert them to objects (`obj1` and `obj2`).
2. **Calculate Shift:** Determine the height of the '1' object (`h`) to calculate the shift distance.
3. **Shift Objects:** Create shifted versions of `obj1` and `obj2`.
    - `obj1_shifted`: Shifted downwards by its height (`h`).
    - `obj2_shifted`: Conditionally shifted upwards by its height if not adjacent to `obj1`.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the shifted objects onto the original grid (`I`) to create the output grid (`O`).


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    obj1 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
    obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 7)
    dh = height(obj1)
    O = paint(paint(I, shift(obj1, (dh, 0))), shift(obj2, branch(adjacent(obj1, obj2), (0,0), (-height(obj2), 0))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract objects from the grid, then identify the objects containing digits '1' and '7'.
2. **Calculate Shift:**  Determine the height (`dh`) of the '1' object.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Shift the objects and paint them directly onto the original grid:
    - `obj1`: Shifted downwards by `dh`.
    - `obj2`: Conditionally shifted upwards by its height if not adjacent to `obj1`, otherwise remains unchanged.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    v1 = mostcolor(I)
    v2 = leastcolor(I)
    O = paint(fill(I, v1, ofcolor(I, v2)), shift(recolor(v2, ofcolor(I, v2)), (height(ofcolor(I, v2)), 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Colors:** Determine the most frequent color (`v1`, assumed to be background) and the least frequent color (`v2`, assumed to be the object to be duplicated and shifted).
2. **Shift and Recolor:** Shift the object identified by `v2` downwards by its height after recoloring it to `v2`.
3. **Paint and Fill:** Paint the shifted object onto the grid and fill the original object's location with the background color (`v1`).

**Note:** This version relies on the assumption that the target objects are represented by the least frequent color in the grid. This might not always be true for more complex inputs.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  seven_indices = ofcolor(I, 7)
  one_height = height(one_indices)
  seven_height = height(seven_indices)

  shifted_one_indices = shift(one_indices, (one_height, 0))
  shifted_seven_indices = shift(seven_indices, (-seven_height, 0))

  O = fill(fill(I, 1, shifted_one_indices), 7, shifted_seven_indices)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Indices:** Find the indices of digits '1' and '7'.
2. **Calculate Heights:** Calculate the heights of the '1' and '7' objects based on their indices.
3. **Shift Indices:** Create shifted versions of the indices.
    - `shifted_one_indices`: Shifted downwards by the height of the '1' object.
    - `shifted_seven_indices`: Shifted upwards by the height of the '7' object.
4. **Fill Grid:** Fill the grid with the corresponding digits ('1' and '7') at the shifted indices.

**Note:** This version does not include the conditional shift for the '7' object based on adjacency to the '1' object.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
    p7 = ofcolor(I, 7)
    O = paint(paint(fill(I, 0, p1), recolor(1, shift(p1, (height(p1), 0)))), recolor(7, shift(p7, branch(adjacent(p1, p7), (0,0), (-height(p7), 0)))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Indices:** Find the indices of digits '1' and '7'.
2. **Conditional Shift and Recolor:** Shift and recolor the objects:
    -  '1' object is shifted downwards by its height and recolored to '1'.
    -  '7' object is conditionally shifted upwards by its height if not adjacent to the '1' object, otherwise remains unchanged. It's then recolored to '7'.
3. **Paint and Fill:** Paint the shifted and recolored objects onto the grid and fill the original '1' object's location with the background color (assumed to be 0).

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to solving the transformation task, each leveraging different DSL functions and logic. You can analyze and compare these approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the DSL and its capabilities in performing spatial transformations on grids.
