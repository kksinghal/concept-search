## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves swapping the positions of two objects in the grid while preserving their original shapes and colors.  The objects to be swapped are identified by their unique colors:

* **Object 1:** The object with the color `2`.
* **Object 2:** The object with the color found at index `(0, 1)` in the input grid.

Let's break down the transformation for each example:

**Example 0:**

* **Input:**  The object with color `2` is a vertical line, and the object with color `6` (at `(0, 1)`) is a square.
* **Output:** The positions of the vertical line and the square are swapped.

**Example 1:**

* **Input:** The object with color `2` is a horizontal line, and the object with color `1` (at `(0, 1)`) is a scattered shape.
* **Output:** The positions of the horizontal line and the scattered shape are swapped. 

**Example 2:**

* **Input:** The object with color `2` is a small L-shape, and the object with color `1` (at `(0, 1)`) is a single cell.
* **Output:** The positions of the L-shape and the single cell are swapped.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color1 = 2  
  color2 = I[0][1] 
  obj1 = extract(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == color1) 
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == color2)
  offset = subtract(ulcorner(obj2), ulcorner(obj1))
  return paint(paint(cover(cover(I, obj1), obj2), shift(obj1, offset)), shift(obj2, invert(offset)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Colors:** Extract the colors of the two objects to be swapped (`color1` and `color2`).
2. **Extract Objects:** Use `objects` to find all objects in the grid and `extract` to select the objects with the target colors.
3. **Calculate Offset:** Determine the positional offset between the upper-left corners of the two objects.
4. **Swap and Paint:**
   - Use `cover` to remove both objects from the input grid.
   - Use `shift` to move each object to the other's position based on the calculated offset.
   - Use `paint` to draw the shifted objects back onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c1 = 2
  c2 = I[0][1]
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == c1:
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(c2, {(0, 0)}), (i, j)))
      elif val == c2:
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(c1, {(0, 0)}), (i, j)))
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(val, {(0, 0)}), (i, j)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Colors:**  Store the colors to be swapped in `c1` and `c2`.
2. **Create Blank Canvas:** Generate a blank canvas (`O`) of the same size and background color as the input grid.
3. **Iterate and Swap:**  Iterate through each cell in the input grid:
   - If the cell color matches `c1`, paint a `c2` colored cell at the same location on the canvas.
   - If the cell color matches `c2`, paint a `c1` colored cell at the same location on the canvas.
   - Otherwise, paint the cell with its original color on the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = toindices(extract(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2))
  obj2 = toindices(extract(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == I[0][1]))
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if (i, j) in obj1:
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(I[0][1], {(0, 0)}), (i, j)))
    elif (i, j) in obj2:
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, {(0, 0)}), (i, j)))
    else:
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(I[i][j], {(0, 0)}), (i, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 2, identify objects with the target colors, but extract their indices directly using `toindices`.
2. **Create Blank Canvas:**  Create a blank canvas like in Version 2.
3. **Iterate and Swap:**  Iterate through all indices of the grid:
   - If the index is part of `obj1`, paint a cell with the color of `obj2` at the same location on the canvas.
   - If the index is part of `obj2`, paint a cell with the color of `obj1` at the same location on the canvas.
   - Otherwise, paint the cell with its original color on the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = extract(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == I[0][1])
  temp = paint(cover(I, obj1), shift(obj2, subtract(ulcorner(obj1), ulcorner(obj2))))
  return paint(cover(temp, obj2), shift(obj1, subtract(ulcorner(obj2), ulcorner(obj1))))
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify and extract the target objects as in previous versions.
2. **Two-Step Swap:** Instead of creating a blank canvas, directly manipulate the input grid:
   - First, remove `obj1` and paint `obj2` at `obj1`'s location.
   - Then, remove `obj2` from the intermediate result and paint `obj1` at `obj2`'s original location.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c1 = 2
  c2 = I[0][1]
  obj1 = toindices(extract(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == c1))
  obj2 = toindices(extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == c2))
  O = [list(row) for row in I]
  for i, row in enumerate(O):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if (i, j) in obj1:
        O[i][j] = c2
      elif (i, j) in obj2:
        O[i][j] = c1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Colors:** Extract both the colors and indices of target objects.
2. **Direct Grid Manipulation:** Modify the input grid directly:
   - Convert the input grid to a list of lists for easier modification.
   - Iterate through each cell, swapping the colors of cells belonging to the target objects.
   - Convert the modified list of lists back to a tuple of tuples before returning. 

Each program version utilizes different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same visual transformation.
