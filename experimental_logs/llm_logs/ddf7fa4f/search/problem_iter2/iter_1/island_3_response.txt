## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects based on color and shifting them vertically. The direction and magnitude of the shift depend on the color and relative position of other objects in the grid. 

**Input 0:**

- The object with color 2 shifts down by its height.
- The object with color 8 shifts up by its height.

**Input 1:**

- The object with color 1 shifts down by its height.
- The object with color 7 shifts down by its height.

**Input 2:**

- The object with color 1 shifts down by its height.
- The object with color 7 shifts down by its height.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct programs using the provided DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 7), I)
  shifted_obj1 = shift(obj1, (height(obj1), 0))
  shifted_obj2 = shift(obj2, (height(obj2), 0))
  O = paint(paint(I, shifted_obj1), shifted_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  Extract the objects with color 1 and 7 from the input grid `I` and store them in `obj1` and `obj2` respectively.
2. **Shift objects:** Shift both `obj1` and `obj2` downwards by their respective heights.
3. **Paint objects:** Paint the shifted objects onto the original grid `I` to get the output grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  obj1 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 7)
  O = paint(paint(I, shift(obj1, (height(obj1), 0))), shift(obj2, (height(obj2), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects` and store them in `objs`. Extract the objects with color 1 and 7.
2. **Shift objects:**  Shift `obj1` and `obj2` downwards by their respective heights.
3. **Paint objects:** Paint the shifted objects onto the original grid `I` to get the output grid `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
  p7 = ofcolor(I, 7)
  O = paint(paint(I, recolor(1, shift(p1, (height(p1), 0)))), recolor(7, shift(p7, (height(p7), 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify object indices:** Get the indices of cells with colors 1 and 7 and store them in `p1` and `p7` respectively.
2. **Shift and recolor:** Shift `p1` and `p7` downwards by their respective heights and recolor them to their original colors.
3. **Paint objects:** Paint the shifted and recolored objects onto the input grid `I` to obtain the output grid `O`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(1, shift(ofcolor(I, 1), (height(ofcolor(I, 1)), 0)))), 
               recolor(7, shift(ofcolor(I, 7), (height(ofcolor(I, 7)), 0))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines steps from previous versions for a more compact representation. It directly identifies object indices, shifts them, recolors them, and paints them back onto the input grid within a single expression.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for color in [1, 7]:
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, color), I)
    I = paint(I, shift(obj, (height(obj), 0)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over colors:** Iterate through the colors 1 and 7.
2. **Shift and paint:** For each color, identify the object, shift it downwards by its height, and paint it onto the input grid `I`. 
3. **Return:** Return the modified input grid `I` as the output grid.

These five program versions showcase different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. Each version offers a distinct logic flow while utilizing the core concepts of object identification, manipulation, and painting.
