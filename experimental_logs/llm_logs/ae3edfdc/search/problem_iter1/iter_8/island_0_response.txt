## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers non-background objects horizontally and moves them to the top of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions.

**Input_0:**

- The '3' objects are centered horizontally and moved to the top rows.
- The '2' object maintains its relative position to the '3' on its right.
- The '7' objects are centered horizontally and moved to row 10.
- The '1' object maintains its relative position to the '7' on its left.

**Input_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, all non-background objects are centered horizontally and shifted to the top rows while maintaining relative positions.

**Input_2:**

- Same transformation logic as above, objects centered horizontally and moved upwards while preserving relative horizontal positioning.


## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1: 
**Code:**
```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create empty canvas
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True): # Loop over foreground objects
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, len(I[0]) // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1]))) # Center horizontally
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0))) # Move to top
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. Iterates through each foreground object in the input grid.
3. For each object:
   - Calculates the horizontal shift needed to center the object.
   - Shifts the object horizontally to the center.
   - Calculates the vertical shift needed to move the object to the top.
   - Shifts the object vertically to the top.
4. Paints the shifted object onto the canvas.

### Program Version 2:
**Code:**
```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    obj = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, c in enumerate(r) if c == v)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, subtract((0, centerofmass(obj)[1]), (0, ulcorner(obj)[1]))))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0)))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. Creates an empty canvas.
2. Iterates through each foreground color.
3. For each color:
   - Extracts the object of that color.
   - Calculates the horizontal shift needed for centering based on the difference between the object's center of mass and its leftmost column.
   - Shifts and paints the object horizontally.
   - Shifts and paints the object vertically to the top.

### Program Version 3:
**Code:**
```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    O = cover(O, obj)
    centered_obj = shift(obj, (0, len(I[0]) // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1]))
    O = paint(O, shift(centered_obj, (-uppermost(centered_obj), 0)))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. Starts with the input grid.
2. Iterates over each foreground object.
3. For each object:
   - Removes the object from the grid.
   - Calculates the horizontal shift for centering.
   - Centers the object horizontally.
   - Calculates the vertical shift for moving to the top.
   - Shifts the object vertically.
   - Paints the centered and shifted object back onto the grid.

### Program Version 4:
**Code:**
```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (uppermost(I) - uppermost(obj), len(I[0]) // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1])))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. Creates an empty canvas.
2. Iterates through foreground objects.
3. For each object:
   - Calculates the horizontal shift needed for centering.
   - Calculates the vertical shift needed to bring it to the top, taking into account potential existing objects already at the top.
   - Shifts the object both horizontally and vertically in one step.
   - Paints the object onto the canvas.

### Program Version 5:
**Code:**
```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    obj = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, c in enumerate(r) if c == v)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), len(I[0]) // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1])))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. Starts with the input grid.
2. Iterates through each foreground color.
3. For each color:
   - Extracts the object of that color.
   - Removes the object from the grid.
   - Calculates the horizontal shift for centering.
   - Calculates the vertical shift for moving to the top.
   - Shifts the object horizontally and vertically.
   - Paints the shifted object back onto the grid.
