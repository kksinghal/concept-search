## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to involve the following:

1. **Object Isolation:** Each distinct digit group in the input grid is treated as a separate object.
2. **Vertical Alignment:** Objects are moved vertically so that their top edge aligns with the top edge of the grid.
3. **Horizontal Compression:**  Objects are moved horizontally to eliminate empty columns, effectively "compressing" the grid horizontally.

**Example:**

Let's analyze Input_0 and Output_0:

- The '3's at the top and bottom left corners are moved to the top rows while maintaining their relative horizontal positions.
- The '2' and the '3' to its right are moved up, aligning with the top '3's.
-  The '7's are moved to the top row while maintaining their relative horizontal positions.
- The '1' remains in its position.
- All empty columns are removed, resulting in a more compact output grid.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" based on the transformation analysis and the DSL functions:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I)))
  current_j = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (-uppermost(obj), current_j)))
    current_j += width(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Extracts all non-background digit groups as separate objects from the input grid.
2. **`O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I)))`:**  Creates an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **`current_j = 0`:** Initializes a variable to track the current horizontal position for placing objects.
4. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each extracted object.
5. **`O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (-uppermost(obj), current_j)))`:** 
    - `normalize(obj)`: Moves the object's upper-left corner to the origin (0,0).
    - `shift(..., (-uppermost(obj), current_j))`: Shifts the normalized object to align its top edge with the top of the grid and positions it horizontally based on `current_j`.
    - `paint(O, ...)`:  Paints the shifted object onto the canvas.
6. **`current_j += width(obj)`:** Updates the horizontal position for the next object to avoid overlap.
7. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)))
    if any(v != mostcolor(I) for v, _ in column):
      O = paint(O, shift(normalize(column), (-uppermost(column), leftmost(toindices(O)))))
  return compress(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:**  Creates a canvas filled with the background color and the input grid's dimensions.
2. **`for j in range(width(I))`:** Iterates through each column of the input grid.
3. **`column = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)))`:** Extracts the current column as an object.
4. **`if any(v != mostcolor(I) for v, _ in column)`:** Checks if the column contains any non-background digits.
5. **`O = paint(O, shift(normalize(column), (-uppermost(column), leftmost(toindices(O)))))`:**
   - If the column has non-background digits, it normalizes, shifts the column to the top-left, and paints it onto the canvas.
6. **`return compress(O)`:** Removes empty columns from the resulting grid, achieving horizontal compression.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  j = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj) + j)))
    j += width(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 1, but instead of normalizing each object and then shifting, it directly shifts each object to the top and to its compressed horizontal position.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    if any(I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) for i in range(height(I))):
      column = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)))
      O = cover(O, column)
      O = paint(O, shift(column, (-uppermost(column), 0)))
  return compress(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **`for j in range(width(I))`:** Iterates through columns of the input grid.
3. **`if any(I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) for i in range(height(I)))`:**  Checks for non-background digits in the column.
4. **`column = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)))`:** Extracts the current column as an object.
5. **`O = cover(O, column)`:** "Erases" the original column from the output grid by filling it with the background color. 
6. **`O = paint(O, shift(column, (-uppermost(column), 0)))`:** Shifts the extracted column to the top and paints it back onto the output grid.
7. **`return compress(O)`:** Removes empty columns for horizontal compression.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    O = underpaint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj) + leftmost(toindices(objects(O, False, False, True)[0])))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses `underpaint` to directly paint objects onto the canvas only where the canvas currently has background color. This simplifies the logic as it doesn't require explicitly erasing objects before repositioning them. 


These five programs provide distinct approaches to achieving the described transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and different ways to think about the problem.
