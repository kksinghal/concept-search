## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves the following steps for each non-background object in the input grid:

1. **Horizontal Expansion:**  The object is expanded horizontally by adding a cell to its left and right with the same color as the object.

2. **Vertical Alignment:** The expanded object is then vertically aligned to the center of the grid.

**Input 0:** 

* The '3' object is expanded horizontally and centered vertically.
* The '2' object is expanded horizontally and centered vertically.
* The '7' objects are expanded horizontally and centered vertically.

**Input 1:** 

* The '7' objects are expanded horizontally and centered vertically.
* The '1' object is expanded horizontally and centered vertically.
* The '3' object is expanded horizontally and centered vertically.
* The '2' object is expanded horizontally and centered vertically. 

**Input 2:** 

* The '3' objects are expanded horizontally and centered vertically.
* The '7' objects are expanded horizontally and centered vertically.
* The '1' object is expanded horizontally and centered vertically.
* The '2' object is expanded horizontally and centered vertically. 

## Program to be Generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(grid):
  def process_object(obj):
    color = color(obj)
    expanded_obj = combine(obj, shift(obj, (0,-1)))
    expanded_obj = combine(expanded_obj, shift(obj, (0,1)))
    return shift(expanded_obj, ((height(grid) - height(expanded_obj)) // 2, 0))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), merge(apply(process_object, fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_object(obj)`:** This function processes each object.
    *  `color = color(obj)`: Extracts the color of the object.
    *  `expanded_obj = combine(obj, shift(obj, (0,-1)))`:  Expands the object horizontally to the left. 
    *  `expanded_obj = combine(expanded_obj, shift(obj, (0,1)))`: Expands the object horizontally to the right.
    * `return shift(expanded_obj, ((height(grid) - height(expanded_obj)) // 2, 0))`:  Shifts the object to vertically center it. 
2. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), ...)`:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the transformed objects onto it.
3. **`merge(apply(process_object, fgpartition(grid)))`:** Applies the `process_object` function to each foreground object and merges them.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(grid):
  def expand_and_center(obj):
    c = color(obj)
    return frozenset({(c, (i + (len(grid) - 1) // 2 - uppermost(obj), j - 1)) for c, (i, j) in obj} | 
                    {(c, (i + (len(grid) - 1) // 2 - uppermost(obj), j)) for c, (i, j) in obj} | 
                    {(c, (i + (len(grid) - 1) // 2 - uppermost(obj), j + 1)) for c, (i, j) in obj})
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), merge(apply(expand_and_center, fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_and_center(obj)`:** This function expands and centers each object in one go.
    *  `c = color(obj)`: Extracts the color of the object.
    *  The three set comprehensions generate the expanded object, horizontally left, center, and right, respectively. 
    *  The `i + (len(grid) - 1) // 2 - uppermost(obj)` part calculates the vertical shift to center the object.
2. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), ...)`:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the transformed objects onto it.
3. **`merge(apply(expand_and_center, fgpartition(grid)))`:** Applies the `expand_and_center` function to each foreground object and merges them.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(grid):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), merge(
      apply(
          lambda obj: shift(
              combine(
                  shift(obj, (0, -1)),
                  combine(obj, shift(obj, (0, 1)))),
              ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)),
          fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines the expansion and centering logic into a single lambda function within the `apply` function.

*  `lambda obj: ...`: An anonymous function that performs the transformation on each object.
    * `shift(..., ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0))`: Centers the expanded object vertically. 
    *  `combine(shift(obj, (0, -1)), ...)`: Expands the object to the left.
    *  `combine(obj, shift(obj, (0, 1))))`: Expands the object to the right.

The remaining parts are similar to the previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(grid):
  def transform_obj(obj):
    return recolor(
      color(obj),
      shift(
          toindices(
              combine(
                  shift(obj, (0, -1)), 
                  combine(
                      toindices(obj), 
                      shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1))
                  )
              )
          ),
          ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)
      )
  )
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), merge(apply(transform_obj, fgpartition(grid)))) 
```
**Explanation:**
* **`transform_obj(obj)`:** This function expands and centers each object by manipulating indices.
    * `toindices(obj)`: Retrieves the indices of the object's cells.
    *  The nested `combine` and `shift` calls create a set of indices representing the expanded object.
    * `recolor(color(obj), ...)`: Recolors the expanded indices with the object's original color. 
    * `shift(..., ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0))`: Centers the expanded object vertically.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(grid):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(grid)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: frozenset(
                  (color(obj), (i + (len(grid) - 1) // 2 - uppermost(obj), j + dj))
                  for c, (i, j) in obj
                  for dj in range(-1, 2)
              ),
              fgpartition(grid)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a nested loop within a set comprehension to achieve both expansion and centering.

*  `for dj in range(-1, 2)`: Iterates through -1, 0, and 1 to create the left, center, and right cells of the expanded object. 
* `(i + (len(grid) - 1) // 2 - uppermost(obj), j + dj)`: Calculates the new indices for the expanded and centered object. 


Each of these program versions implements the same transformation logic but uses different DSL functions and strategies, offering diverse solutions to the problem.
