## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying non-zero objects in the input grid, compressing them vertically, and then centering them vertically on the grid while maintaining their horizontal position. Let's break down each output:

**Output_0:** The "323" object is compressed vertically and centered.  The "717" object is also compressed and centered, but its horizontal span is extended to include the initial and final '7' elements.

**Output_1:** Similar to Output_0, the "717" object is compressed and centered, with its horizontal span extended. The "32" object is also compressed and centered.

**Output_2:**  The transformation compresses and centers the "71" and "323" objects individually. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid,False,True,True)
  output = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  for obj in objs:
    w = width(obj)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj) + (shape(grid)[1] - w) // 2))
    output = paint(output, shifted_obj)
  return output 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(grid, False, True, True)` finds all non-zero connected objects in the grid.
2. **Create Empty Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(grid))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input.
3. **Iterate and Transform:** The code iterates through each object:
    - `w = width(obj)` gets the object's width.
    - `shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj) + (shape(grid)[1] - w) // 2))` shifts the object to the top left corner and horizontally centers it.
    - `paint(output, shifted_obj)` paints the transformed object onto the output canvas.
4. **Return Output:**  The function returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = fgpartition(grid)
  output = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  for obj in objs:
    normalized = normalize(obj)
    centered = shift(normalized, ((shape(grid)[0] - height(normalized)) // 2, 0))
    output = paint(output, centered)
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition by Color:** `fgpartition(grid)` separates the grid into objects based on color, excluding the background.
2. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(grid))` creates an empty grid.
3. **Process Objects:**  For each object:
   - `normalize(obj)` moves the object's upper-left corner to the origin.
   - `centered = shift(normalized, ((shape(grid)[0] - height(normalized)) // 2, 0))` centers the object vertically.
   - `output = paint(output, centered)` paints the object onto the output grid.
4. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, True, True)
  output = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  for obj in objs:
    left_edge = leftmost(obj)
    right_edge = rightmost(obj)
    width = right_edge - left_edge + 1
    centered_obj = shift(obj, (
        -uppermost(obj) + (shape(grid)[0] - height(obj)) // 2,
        -left_edge + (shape(grid)[1] - width) // 2
    ))
    output = paint(output, centered_obj)
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** `objects(grid, True, True, True)` identifies connected regions of non-background colors.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(grid))` generates an empty grid with the input's dimensions.
3. **Process Objects:** For each object:
    - Determine horizontal boundaries (`left_edge`, `right_edge`) and width.
    - Calculate the shift needed for vertical centering and horizontal centering based on the object's width.
    - `shift(obj, ...)` repositions the object on the grid based on the calculated shifts.
    - `paint(output, centered_obj)` draws the centered object onto the output grid.
4. **Return:** The function returns the output grid with transformed objects.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(grid):
  def process_object(obj):
    height = lowermost(obj) - uppermost(obj) + 1
    return shift(obj, ((shape(grid)[0] - height) // 2, 0))

  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), merge(apply(process_object, fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** `process_object(obj)` takes an object and calculates the vertical shift required to center it within the grid, then returns the shifted object.
2. **Partition Grid:** `fgpartition(grid)` divides the grid into objects based on color, excluding the background.
3. **Apply Transformation:** `apply(process_object, fgpartition(grid))` applies the `process_object` function to each identified object.
4. **Merge Objects:** `merge(...)` combines the transformed objects back into a single object set.
5. **Create Canvas and Paint:** `paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), ...)` creates a blank canvas and paints the merged, transformed objects onto it.
6. **Return Output:** The function returns the final transformed grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(grid):
  def center_vertically(obj):
    obj_height = lowermost(obj) - uppermost(obj) + 1
    vertical_shift = (shape(grid)[0] - obj_height) // 2
    return shift(obj, (vertical_shift, 0))

  transformed_objects = apply(center_vertically, fgpartition(grid))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), merge(transformed_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `center_vertically` Function:** This function takes an object as input, calculates its height, determines the vertical shift needed for centering, and returns the vertically shifted object.
2. **Partition into Objects:** `fgpartition(grid)` separates the grid into distinct objects based on color, excluding the background.
3. **Apply Centering:** `apply(center_vertically, fgpartition(grid))` applies the `center_vertically` function to each object from the partitioned grid.
4. **Merge Objects:** `merge(transformed_objects)` combines all the transformed objects back into a single set.
5. **Create Canvas and Paint:** `paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), ...)` generates a new canvas of the same size as the input grid and paints the merged, centered objects onto it.
6. **Return Result:** The function returns the final grid with vertically centered objects.


Each of these programs offers a different approach to achieve the same visual transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for manipulating spatial data.
