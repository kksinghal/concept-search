## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to "gather" or "pull" non-zero digits towards the center of the grid, aligning them either vertically or horizontally while maintaining their relative positions within their original rows or columns.  The background (digit '0') remains unchanged.

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
* The '3' digits in the first column have merged into a vertical line at the center of the grid.
* The '3 2 3' sequence in the fifth row remains in the same row but is now centered. 
* The '7' digits have formed a horizontal line at the center, with the '1' digit centered within that line.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* Similar to Input_0, non-zero digits are pulled towards the center, forming a vertical line ('7') and a centered horizontal sequence ('3 2').

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
*  Again, the pattern holds: non-zero digits are gathered towards the center, with the '7 1' forming a vertical line and the '3 2 3' forming a centered horizontal sequence.


## Code Generation:

Based on the transformation analysis, here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  out = I
  for obj in objs:
    if vline(obj):
      out = paint(out, shift(normalize(obj), (height(I) // 2 - height(obj) // 2, width(I) // 2 - width(obj) // 2)))
    else:
      out = paint(out, shift(normalize(obj), (height(I) // 2 - height(obj) // 2, width(I) // 2 - width(obj) // 2)))
  O = out
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Center:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`). 
   -  If the object is a vertical line (`vline(obj)`), it's centered vertically and horizontally.
   -  If the object is not a vertical line, it is also centered both vertically and horizontally.
3. **Paint to Output:**  The centered object is then painted (`paint`) onto the output grid `out`.
4. **Return:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for j in range(w):
    col = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(h) if I[i][j] != ZERO)
    if len(col) > 0:
      O = paint(O, shift(normalize(col), (h // 2 - height(col) // 2, j)))
  for i in range(h):
    row = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for j in range(w) if I[i][j] != ZERO)
    if len(row) > 0:
      O = paint(O, shift(normalize(row), (i, w // 2 - width(row) // 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty output grid `O` of the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Process Columns:** Iterates through each column (`j`).
   - Extracts non-zero cells in the column as an object (`col`).
   - Centers the object vertically and paints it onto the output grid `O` at the original column index.
3. **Process Rows:** Iterates through each row (`i`).
   - Extracts non-zero cells in the row as an object (`row`).
   - Centers the object horizontally and paints it onto the output grid `O` at the original row index.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  transposed = rot90(I)
  objs = objects(transposed, F, F, T)
  out = I
  for obj in objs:
    centered = shift(normalize(obj), (height(I) // 2 - height(obj) // 2, width(I) // 2 - width(obj) // 2))
    rotated = rot270(centered)
    out = paint(out, rotated)
  O = out
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:** Rotates the input grid `I` 90 degrees (`rot90`) to simplify processing rows as objects.
2. **Extract Objects:** Identifies non-background objects in the transposed grid.
3. **Center and Rotate Back:** 
   - Centers each object in the transposed grid.
   - Rotates the centered object back to its original orientation (`rot270`).
   - Paints the object onto the output grid `out`.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  h, w = height(I), width(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        target_i = h // 2 + (i - h // 2)
        target_j = w // 2 + (j - w // 2)
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (target_i, target_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty output grid `O`.
2. **Iterate and Calculate Target:** Iterates through each cell. If the cell is not background:
   - Calculates the target row (`target_i`) by maintaining the cell's relative distance from the grid's center row.
   - Calculates the target column (`target_j`) similarly, maintaining the relative distance from the center column.
3. **Paint:** Paints the cell onto the output grid at the calculated target position.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  h, w = height(I), width(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    row_obj = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for j in range(w) if I[i][j] != ZERO)
    if row_obj:
      O = paint(O, shift(row_obj, (0, w // 2 - width(row_obj) // 2)))
  for j in range(w):
    col_obj = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(h) if I[i][j] != ZERO)
    if col_obj:
      O = paint(O, shift(col_obj, (h // 2 - height(col_obj) // 2, 0)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty output grid.
2. **Process Rows:**  Extracts each row as an object and centers it horizontally on the output grid.
3. **Process Columns:** Extracts each column as an object and centers it vertically on the output grid.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified grid.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic flow. Each version effectively gathers and aligns the non-zero digits towards the center of the grid while preserving their relative positions within their original rows or columns.
