## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to center non-background objects vertically and then expands them horizontally by adding a copy of the object to the left and right. 

Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The "3" objects are centered vertically.
* Each "3" object is expanded horizontally with two additional "3"s, one on each side.
* The "2" and "1" objects remain unchanged.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The "7" objects are centered vertically.
* Each "7" object is expanded horizontally with two additional "7"s, one on each side.
* The "1", "3", and "2" objects remain unchanged.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The "7" objects are centered vertically.
* Each "7" object is expanded horizontally with two additional "7"s, one on each side.
* The "1", "3", and "2" objects remain unchanged.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  def expand_object(obj):
    return combine(shift(obj, (0, -1)), combine(obj, shift(obj, (0, 1))))
  centered_objects = merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)), fgpartition(grid)))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(expand_object, centered_objects)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_object(obj)` Function:** This function takes an object as input and returns a new object expanded horizontally by adding a copy on the left and right.
2. **`centered_objects`:**  
   - We use `fgpartition(grid)` to get a set of objects excluding the background.
   - For each object, we calculate the vertical offset needed to center it and use `shift(obj, offset)` to move it.
   - Finally, we merge all centered objects using `merge`.
3. **Final Output:** We create a blank canvas using `canvas` with the background color and then paint the `centered_objects` onto it using `paint`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  def expand_and_center(obj):
    expanded = combine(shift(obj, (0, -1)), combine(obj, shift(obj, (0, 1))))
    return shift(expanded, ((len(grid) - height(expanded)) // 2, 0))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(expand_and_center, fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_and_center(obj)` Function:** This function combines the expanding and centering logic into a single function for improved readability.
2.  Similar to Version 1, we apply this function to all foreground objects, merge them, and paint them onto a blank canvas. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  output = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in fgpartition(grid):
    centered_obj = shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0))
    expanded_obj = combine(shift(centered_obj, (0, -1)), combine(centered_obj, shift(centered_obj, (0, 1))))
    output = paint(output, expanded_obj)
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version iterates through each foreground object individually, performs centering and expansion, and paints the resulting object onto the output canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  def process_object(obj, grid):
    offset = ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)
    return shift(combine(shift(obj, (0, -1)), combine(obj, shift(obj, (0, 1)))), offset)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(rbind(process_object, grid), fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version uses `rbind` to create a partially applied function `process_object` that takes only the object as input, with the grid already bound. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), 
      merge(apply(
          lambda obj: combine(
              shift(
                  shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)), 
                  (0, -1)
              ), 
              combine(
                  shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)), 
                  shift(
                      shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)), 
                      (0, 1)
                  )
              )
          ), 
          fgpartition(grid)
      ))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version compresses the entire logic into a single line using nested lambda functions and function calls, making it less readable but potentially more efficient.


These five programs provide a diverse set of solutions using different logic and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the same data transformation.
