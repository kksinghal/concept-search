## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers each object horizontally in the grid while maintaining its vertical position. The background remains unchanged.

**Input_0:**

- The '3' objects are centered horizontally.
- The '2' object is already centered.
- The '7' objects are centered horizontally.

**Input_1:**

- The '7' objects are centered horizontally.
- The '1' object is already centered.
- The '3' and '2' objects are centered horizontally.

**Input_2:**

- The '3' objects are centered horizontally.
- The '7' and '1' objects are centered horizontally.
- The '2' object is already centered.

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  center_col = width(I) // 2
  output = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    obj_width = width(obj)
    col_offset = center_col - (obj_width // 2) - leftmost(obj)
    output = paint(output, shift(obj, (0, col_offset)))
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We identify all objects on the grid using `objects(I, False, False, True)`.
2. **Centering Logic:** We calculate the horizontal center of the grid (`center_col`) and the required offset for each object (`col_offset`).
3. **Object Shifting:** We shift each object horizontally by the calculated offset using `shift(obj, (0, col_offset))`.
4. **Painting to Output:**  The shifted object is painted onto the output canvas.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - width(obj) // 2 - leftmost(obj))),
              objects(I, False, False, True)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested function calls for a more compact representation. 

1. **Extract Objects:**  Objects are extracted as before.
2. **Calculate Offset and Shift:** For each object, the offset is calculated and applied within a lambda function using `shift`.
3. **Merge and Paint:** All shifted objects are merged and painted onto a blank canvas.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  output = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    output = paint(
        output, 
        shift(obj, (0,  width(I) // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1]))
    )
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly leverages the `centerofmass` function for determining the horizontal center of each object.

1. **Extract Objects:** Objects are extracted.
2. **Centering with `centerofmass`:**  The `centerofmass` function is used to find each object's center, and the offset is calculated.
3. **Shifting and Painting:** Objects are shifted and painted onto the output grid.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fold(
      lambda acc, obj: paint(
          acc,
          shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1]))
      ),
      objects(I, False, False, True),
      canvas(0, shape(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces the `fold` function for iteratively processing the objects.

1. **Extract Objects:** Objects are extracted.
2. **Iterative Centering and Painting:** The `fold` function iterates over the objects. For each object, it calculates the offset using `centerofmass`, shifts the object, and paints it onto the accumulator (`acc`), which is initially a blank canvas.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))),
              objects(I, False, False, True)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines `apply` and `merge` for a functional approach.

1. **Extract Objects:** Objects are extracted.
2. **Calculate Offset and Shift:** We apply a lambda function to each object using `apply`. Inside the lambda function, the offset is calculated, and the object is shifted.
3. **Merge and Paint:** The shifted objects are merged using `merge` and then painted onto a blank canvas.


**Note:** 
- The code assumes that the `fold` function is available in the DSL. If not, you can replace it with a loop-based implementation.
- All versions achieve the same transformation; they just use different approaches and function combinations.
