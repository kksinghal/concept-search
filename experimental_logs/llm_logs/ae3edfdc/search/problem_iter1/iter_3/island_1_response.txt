## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to follow these rules:

1. **Object Extraction and Centering:**  The program first identifies all the distinct objects in the input grid. An object is defined as a connected group of non-zero digits. The background color is considered to be 0. Each object is then centered horizontally on a new row of the output grid. 

2. **Vertical Stacking:** The centered objects are then stacked vertically. The vertical positioning seems to be based on the order of appearance in the input grid, with the first object placed closest to the top.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  out = canvas(0, shape(I))
  y_offset = 0
  for obj in objs:
    obj_width = width(obj)
    x_offset = width(I) // 2 - obj_width // 2
    out = paint(out, shift(normalize(obj), (y_offset, x_offset)))
    y_offset += height(obj)
  return out
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** `objs = objects(I, F, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`, considering objects as connected components of non-zero values, excluding the background (0). 
2. **Canvas Initialization:** `out = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty canvas `out` of the same size as the input grid, filled with zeros.
3. **Iterative Object Placement:** The code iterates through each object in `objs`:
   - `obj_width = width(obj)` calculates the width of the current object.
   - `x_offset = width(I) // 2 - obj_width // 2` determines the horizontal offset to center the object on the canvas.
   - `out = paint(out, shift(normalize(obj), (y_offset, x_offset)))` paints the normalized (top-left corner at (0, 0)) and shifted object onto the canvas at the calculated position.
   - `y_offset += height(obj)` updates the vertical offset for the next object placement.
4. **Output:** The function returns the modified canvas `out` with the transformed objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  out = canvas(0, shape(I))
  return paint(out, merge(apply(lambda obj, y: shift(normalize(obj), (y, width(I) // 2 - width(obj) // 2)), objs, interval(0, len(objs), 1))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction & Canvas:** Similar to Program Version 1.
2. **Object Shifting and Merging:** This version utilizes functional programming concepts:
   - `apply(lambda obj, y: shift(normalize(obj), (y, width(I) // 2 - width(obj) // 2)), objs, interval(0, len(objs), 1))` applies a lambda function to each object in `objs`. This lambda function takes an object and its index `y` in the list, normalizes the object, calculates the horizontal offset to center it, and shifts it vertically based on its index.
   - `merge(...)` merges all the shifted objects into a single object.
3. **Painting & Output:** The merged object is then painted onto the canvas and returned, similar to Program Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  out = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objects(I, F, F, T)):
    out = paint(out, shift(normalize(obj), (i * height(obj), width(I) // 2 - width(obj) // 2)))
  return out
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Direct Iteration & Painting:** This version directly iterates through the objects extracted from the input grid using `enumerate` to get both the object and its index `i`.
3. **Object Placement:** It calculates the vertical offset using `i * height(obj)` to stack the objects directly during the iteration. The rest of the logic for centering and painting the object remains similar.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  h, w = shape(I)
  return paint(canvas(0, (h, w)), merge({shift(normalize(obj), (h // 2 - height(obj) // 2 + sum(height(o) for o in objs[:i]), w // 2 - width(obj) // 2)) for i, obj in enumerate(objs)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction & Dimensions:** This version pre-calculates the height and width of the input grid.
2. **Object Positioning and Merging:**  It uses a set comprehension to iterate through the objects and calculate their positions:
   - `h // 2 - height(obj) // 2 + sum(height(o) for o in objs[:i])` determines the vertical offset of each object, ensuring they are stacked vertically.
   - `w // 2 - width(obj) // 2` calculates the horizontal offset for centering.
   - `shift(normalize(obj), ...)` shifts the normalized object to its calculated position.
   - `merge({...})` merges all the positioned objects.
3. **Painting and Output:** The merged object is painted onto a blank canvas and returned. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, F, F, T), key=lambda obj: -height(obj))
  out = canvas(0, shape(I))
  y_offset = 0
  for obj in objs:
    out = paint(out, shift(normalize(obj), (y_offset, width(I) // 2 - width(obj) // 2)))
    y_offset += height(obj)
  return out
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sorted Object Extraction:** This version sorts the extracted objects based on their height in descending order using `sorted` and a lambda function as the key.
2. **Iterative Placement:**  The rest of the logic is similar to Version 1, but the objects are now processed in order of decreasing height, ensuring larger objects are placed first.

These five versions showcase different ways to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and programming paradigms.
