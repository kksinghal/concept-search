## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-zero digits in the input grid towards the vertical center line of the grid, while maintaining their relative horizontal positions. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

- The '3's and '2' are moved towards the center vertical line (column 7). 
- The '7's and '1' are also moved towards the center vertical line.
- The relative horizontal distances between digits within each object are maintained.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, all non-zero digits are moved horizontally towards the center vertical line.
- Again, relative horizontal positions within each object are maintained.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

- This example reinforces the pattern: all non-zero digits are drawn towards the central vertical line of the grid.
- Relative horizontal positioning within objects is preserved.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I):         # Iterate over foreground objects
    shift_amount = (len(I[0]) // 2) - centerofmass(obj)[1] # Calculate horizontal shift
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, shift_amount)))  # Shift the object and paint
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an empty canvas of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **Iterate Objects:**  `fgpartition(I)` separates the input grid into distinct objects (sets of connected non-background cells). 
3. **Calculate Shift:**  `shift_amount` is calculated by finding the difference between the center column of the grid (`len(I[0]) // 2`) and the center column of the object (`centerofmass(obj)[1]`).
4. **Shift and Paint:**  `shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))` moves the object horizontally by `shift_amount`. `paint(O, ...)` then draws the shifted object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      next((v for (v, (pi, pj)) in obj if pj == j and abs(pi - centerofmass(obj)[0]) <= len(I) // 2 - abs(i - len(I) // 2)), mostcolor(I))
      for j in range(len(I[0])))
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Loops:** The code uses nested loops to iterate over each cell (i, j) of the output grid.
2. **Find Matching Cell:** For each cell, it iterates over all cells in each object (`obj`) from `fgpartition(I)`. It looks for a cell `(pi, pj)` within the object that has the same column (`pj == j`) and whose row index (`pi`) falls within a horizontally mirrored region around the object's center of mass.
3. **Retrieve Color:** If a matching cell is found, its color (`v`) is used for the output cell. Otherwise, the background color (`mostcolor(I)`) is used.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = paint(O, {(v, (i, len(I[0]) // 2 + (j - centerofmass(obj)[1]))) for (v, (i, j)) in obj})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:**  Same as Version 1, creates an empty canvas.
2. **Iterate and Shift:** Iterates over objects and directly calculates the new coordinates of each cell within the object, shifting them horizontally towards the center while preserving their relative positions.
3. **Paint:** Paints the shifted object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      next((I[i][k] for k in range(len(I[0])) if (I[i][k] != mostcolor(I) and abs(k - centerofmass(obj)[1]) == abs(j - len(I[0]) // 2))), mostcolor(I))
      for j in range(len(I[0])))
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Output Grid:** Iterates through each cell (i, j) of the output grid.
2. **Find Matching Cell in Input:** For each output cell, it searches the corresponding row (i) in the input grid for a non-background cell whose horizontal distance from the object's center of mass is mirrored in the output. 
3. **Copy Color:** If a match is found, it copies the color of that input cell to the output cell. Otherwise, the background color is used.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # For each non-background cell
        shift_amount = (len(I[0]) // 2) - j  # Calculate horizontal shift 
        O = paint(cover(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))}), {(I[i][j], (i, j + shift_amount))}) # Move and paint
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Input Grid:**  Iterates over each cell in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Shift:** For non-background cells, calculates the horizontal shift required to move the cell to its corresponding position relative to the center vertical line.
3. **Move and Paint:** Removes the original cell (`cover`), calculates the new position (`(i, j + shift_amount)`), and paints it back onto the grid. 

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, leveraging various DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a distinct solution while adhering to the constraints of the provided DSL.
