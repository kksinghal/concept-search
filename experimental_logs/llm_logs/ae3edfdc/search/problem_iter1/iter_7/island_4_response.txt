## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation being applied to the input grids involves the following steps:

1. **Object Isolation:** Each unique digit in the grid is treated as a distinct object.
2. **Horizontal Mirroring:** Each object is mirrored horizontally.
3. **Vertical Compression:** All empty rows above and below each mirrored object are removed, effectively "compressing" the object vertically towards its center.

Let's illustrate with an example from Input_0:

* The digit '3' appears in three locations: (0,3), (4,0), (4,8).  
* After mirroring and compression, these become:
    * (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)
    * (4,0), (5,0), (6,0) 
    * (4,8), (5,8), (6,8)

## Program_to_be_generated (5 Versions):

**Version 1**

```python
def program(grid):
    output = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))  # Create empty canvas
    for obj in fgpartition(grid):  # Iterate over objects (without background)
      mirrored_obj = hmirror(obj)  # Mirror each object horizontally
      top = uppermost(mirrored_obj)  # Find top row of mirrored object
      bottom = lowermost(mirrored_obj)  # Find bottom row of mirrored object
      height = bottom - top + 1  # Calculate object height
      new_top = top + height // 2  # Calculate new top row after compression
      output = underpaint(output, shift(mirrored_obj, (new_top - top, 0)))  # Paint the compressed object onto the canvas
    return output 
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through each object, mirrors it, calculates the new top row position after compression, and then paints it onto the output canvas.

**Version 2**

```python
def program(grid):
  output = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)) # Create empty canvas
  for obj in objects(grid, False, True, True): # Iterate through objects
    mirrored_obj = hmirror(obj) # Mirror each object
    center_row = centerofmass(mirrored_obj)[0] # Find the row index of the center of mass
    output = underpaint(output, shift(mirrored_obj, (center_row - uppermost(mirrored_obj), 0))) # Shift and paint object based on center of mass
  return output
```

**Explanation:** This version leverages the `centerofmass` function to determine the vertical shift needed for compression.

**Version 3**

```python
def program(grid):
    output = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (height(grid), width(grid)))
    for obj in fgpartition(grid):
        obj_height = height(obj)
        output = paint(output, shift(hmirror(obj), (obj_height // 2, 0)))
    return output
```

**Explanation:** This version simplifies the logic by directly calculating the vertical shift from the object's height and using `paint` instead of `underpaint`.

**Version 4**

```python
def program(grid):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(hmirror(obj), (height(obj) // 2, 0)), 
                           fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:** This version employs a functional approach, using `merge` and `apply` to process and combine the transformed objects into a single set before painting them onto the canvas.

**Version 5**

```python
def program(grid):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            v for j, v in enumerate(hmirror(row)) if j < len(row) // 2 or j >= len(row) - len(row) // 2
        ) for row in grid
    )
```

**Explanation:** This version directly manipulates the grid rows, mirroring and compressing them without explicitly creating or manipulating objects.



Each of these versions offers a distinct approach to achieving the same transformation. The choice of which version to use might depend on factors like code readability, performance, and personal preference.
