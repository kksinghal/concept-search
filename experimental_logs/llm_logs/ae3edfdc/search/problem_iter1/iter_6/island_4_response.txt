## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in these input-output pairs appears to be:

**For each distinct non-zero value in the input grid:**

1. **Identify the object:**  Find all connected cells with the same value.
2. **Center the object vertically:** Calculate the object's height and shift it vertically so its center aligns with the grid's horizontal midline.
3. **Expand the object horizontally:** Extend the object to the left and right by one cell, duplicating the object's values.
4. **Paint the expanded object onto a blank canvas:** The canvas should have the same dimensions as the input grid and be filled with the most common color from the input grid (presumably 0 in these examples).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Connectivity:** The definition of "connected cells" seems to be based on direct neighbors (up, down, left, right), excluding diagonal connections.
* **Overlapping:** When expanded objects overlap, the last painted object takes precedence.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing the provided DSL functions, along with explanations for each:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    def expand_object(obj):
        return combine(shift(obj, (0, -1)), combine(obj, shift(obj, (0, 1))))

    centered_objects = frozenset(
        shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)) for obj in fgpartition(grid)
    )
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(expand_object, centered_objects)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_object(obj)`:** This helper function takes an object and returns a new object expanded horizontally by one cell on each side.
2. **`centered_objects`:** This part iterates through each object identified by `fgpartition(grid)` (which excludes background objects) and shifts them vertically to be centered on the grid's horizontal midline.
3. **`paint(...)`:** Finally, it creates a blank canvas using `canvas` with the input grid's dimensions and fills it with the background color (`mostcolor(grid)`). Then, it paints the expanded and centered objects onto this canvas.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(lambda obj: combine(shift(shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)), (0, -1)), combine(shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)), shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 1)))), fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single line by using nested lambda functions and directly applies both the horizontal expansion and vertical centering within the `apply` function. While less readable, it demonstrates a different way to achieve the same result.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def process_object(obj):
    centered_obj = shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0))
    expanded_obj = frozenset((v, (i, j + shift_val)) for v, (i, j) in centered_obj for shift_val in (-1, 0, 1))
    return expanded_obj
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(process_object, fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a more descriptive helper function `process_object` that handles both the centering and expansion of individual objects before merging and painting them onto the canvas. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    def expand_horizontally(obj):
        return combine(obj, combine(shift(obj, (0, 1)), shift(obj, (0, -1))))
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(lambda obj: expand_horizontally(shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0))), fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the horizontal expansion into a dedicated helper function `expand_horizontally` for improved readability and modularity.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def process_color(color):
    obj = extract(fgpartition(grid), lambda o: color in palette(o))
    return combine(shift(shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)), (0, -1)), combine(shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 0)), shift(obj, ((height(grid) - height(obj)) // 2, 1))))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(process_color, palette(grid) - {mostcolor(grid)})))
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each unique color (excluding the background) and processes all objects of that color together. While less efficient, it demonstrates a different approach to object manipulation.


These five versions showcase diverse ways of combining DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation. Remember that choosing the most readable and maintainable solution is crucial in real-world scenarios.
