## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers all objects around the vertical midline of the grid, removing any empty rows and columns from the top and bottom of the output.

**Input 0:** All objects (3s, a 2, a 1, and 7s) are moved so that their centers of mass align with the vertical midline of the grid (column index 7). Empty rows at the top and bottom are removed.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, all objects are centered around the vertical midline. Again, empty rows at the top and bottom are trimmed.

**Input 2:**  The same centering transformation is applied. The empty rows at the top and bottom are removed.

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  grid_center_j = center(asindices(I))[1]

  def reposition(obj):
    return (0, grid_center_j - centerofmass(obj)[1])

  centered_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, reposition(obj)), objs)
  painted_grid = paint(I, merge(centered_objs))
  return compress(painted_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Vertical Midline:** `grid_center_j = center(asindices(I))[1]` finds the column index of the grid's vertical midline.
3. **Calculate Repositioning Offset:**  `reposition(obj)` calculates the vertical offset required to center each object `obj` on the midline.
4. **Shift Objects:** `apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, reposition(obj)), objs)` shifts each object by its calculated offset.
5. **Paint Objects onto Grid:** `paint(I, merge(centered_objs))` paints the shifted objects onto a copy of the input grid.
6. **Compress Grid:** `compress(painted_grid)` removes any empty rows and columns from the top and bottom of the resulting grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  mid_j = width(I) // 2
  
  def reposition(obj):
    obj_center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    return (0, mid_j - obj_center_j)
  
  return compress(paint(I, merge(apply(lambda o: shift(o, reposition(o)), objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all the objects in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Midpoint:** `mid_j = width(I) // 2` determines the horizontal midpoint of the grid.
3. **Define Repositioning Function:** `reposition(obj)` takes an object, calculates the difference between its center of mass and the grid's midpoint, and returns the offset needed to center the object.
4. **Shift Objects:**  `apply(lambda o: shift(o, reposition(o)), objs)` applies the `reposition` function to each object, shifting it horizontally to align with the grid's midpoint.
5. **Paint to Grid:** `paint(I, ...)` paints the shifted objects onto the input grid.
6. **Compress:** `compress(...)` removes any leading or trailing empty rows and columns. 


**Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return compress(paint(I,  
                        merge(apply(lambda obj: 
                                    shift(obj, (0, center(asindices(I))[1] - centerofmass(obj)[1])), 
                                    objects(I, T, T, T)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines multiple operations into a single line for conciseness. 

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects.
2. **Calculate Offsets and Shift:** The `lambda` function calculates the horizontal offset for each object and `shift` moves it accordingly.
3. **Merge and Paint:** Shifted objects are merged and painted onto the input grid.
4. **Compress:** Finally, `compress` removes any surrounding empty rows and columns.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def reposition_object(obj):
    obj_center = centerofmass(obj)
    grid_center_j = center(asindices(I))[1]
    return shift(obj, (0, grid_center_j - obj_center[1]))

  return compress(paint(I, merge(apply(reposition_object, objects(I, T, T, T)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a separate function `reposition_object` to handle the object shifting logic, improving code readability.

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies the objects.
2. **Reposition Objects:**  `reposition_object` calculates the offset and uses `shift` to center each object.
3. **Apply, Merge, and Paint:** The repositioned objects are merged and painted onto the input grid.
4. **Compress Grid:**  `compress` removes any empty border rows and columns. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
    return compress(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
                          merge(apply(lambda obj:
                                       shift(obj, (0, center(asindices(I))[1] - centerofmass(obj)[1])), 
                                       objects(I, T, T, T))))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version explicitly creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the centered objects onto it.

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a grid of 0s with the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Identify Objects, Calculate Offsets, Shift, Merge, and Paint:** This part is identical to Version 3, centering the objects.
3. **Compress:** `compress` removes any empty rows and columns.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
