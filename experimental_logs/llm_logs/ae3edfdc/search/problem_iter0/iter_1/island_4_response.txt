## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers all non-background objects from the input grid onto a 15x15 canvas while maintaining their relative vertical positions. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 & Output_0:** The three objects (3, 32, and 717) are identified and moved to the center of the canvas. Notice how the vertical spacing between the objects is maintained.
* **Input_1 & Output_1:**  Similar to the previous example, the objects (717, 323) are centered while keeping their original vertical alignment. 
* **Input_2 & Output_2:** This example reaffirms the transformation logic. The objects (3, 71, 323) are centered on the canvas, preserving their vertical order.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    non_bg_objs = objects(I, F, F, T) # Extract non-background objects
    stacked_objs = frozenset()
    offset = (0, 0)
    for obj in non_bg_objs:
        stacked_objs |= shift(obj, offset) # Stack objects vertically
        offset = (offset[0] + height(obj), 0) 
    center_offset = ((15 - height(stacked_objs)) // 2, (15 - width(stacked_objs)) // 2)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), shift(stacked_objs, center_offset))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Non-Background Objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies all distinct, non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Stack Objects Vertically:** The code iterates through each extracted object and uses `shift(obj, offset)` to move them vertically based on the accumulated height (`offset`). This maintains their relative vertical positions.
3. **Center the Stacked Objects:** The center offset is calculated based on the stacked objects' dimensions. `shift(stacked_objs, center_offset)` centers the stacked objects on the 15x15 canvas.
4. **Paint onto Canvas:**  Finally, `paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), ...)` creates a blank 15x15 canvas and paints the centered, stacked objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  stacked_grid = canvas(0, (15,15))
  v_offset = 0
  for obj in objs:
    obj_height = height(obj)
    stacked_grid = vconcat(stacked_grid[:v_offset], 
                             paint(stacked_grid[v_offset:], 
                                   shift(obj, ((15 - obj_height) // 2, (15 - width(obj)) // 2))))
    v_offset += obj_height
  return stacked_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to version 1, we extract non-background objects.
2. **Iterative Vertical Concatenation:** We start with a blank canvas and iterate through the objects. For each object:
    - Calculate its height (`obj_height`).
    - Center it horizontally and shift it down by `v_offset`.
    - Paint this centered object onto a slice of the canvas starting at `v_offset`.
    - Update `v_offset` to the position below the currently painted object.
3. **Return Canvas:** The final stacked grid is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs_indices = mapply(lambda obj: toindices(obj), objects(I, F, F, T))
  merged_indices = merge(objs_indices)
  total_height = sum([height(ind) for ind in objs_indices])
  center_offset = ((15 - total_height) // 2, (15 - width(merged_indices)) // 2)
  centered_indices = shift(merged_indices, center_offset)
  return fill(canvas(0, (15, 15)), 1, centered_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Merge Indices:** Extract indices of all non-background objects and merge them into a single set.
2. **Calculate Total Height and Center Offset:** Calculate the total height of all objects combined and use it to determine the vertical offset required for centering.
3. **Shift and Fill:** Shift the merged indices by the calculated offset and fill a blank canvas with '1' at these indices.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  canvas_center = (7, 7)  
  output_grid = canvas(0, (15, 15))
  current_height = 0
  for obj in objs:
    obj_height = height(obj)
    obj_width = width(obj)
    centered_obj = shift(obj, (canvas_center[0] - obj_height // 2 - current_height, 
                              canvas_center[1] - obj_width // 2))
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, centered_obj)
    current_height += obj_height
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Define Center:** Similar to previous versions, extract non-background objects and define the canvas center explicitly.
2. **Iterative Centering and Painting:**  For each object:
    - Calculate object height and width.
    - Calculate the shift required to center the object both vertically (considering the `current_height` for stacking) and horizontally.
    - Paint the centered object onto the output grid.
    - Update `current_height`. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  heights = apply(height, objs)
  total_height = sum(heights)
  offset = (7 - total_height // 2, 0)
  O = canvas(0, (15, 15))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (offset[0] + sum(heights[:i]), 7 - width(obj) // 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Calculate Total Height:** Extract non-background objects and calculate their total height.
2. **Determine Initial Offset:** Calculate the initial vertical offset based on the total height to center the objects vertically.
3. **Iterate, Shift, and Paint:** Iterate through objects:
    - Calculate the vertical shift based on the accumulated height of previously placed objects. 
    - Center each object horizontally.
    - Paint the shifted object onto the canvas.
