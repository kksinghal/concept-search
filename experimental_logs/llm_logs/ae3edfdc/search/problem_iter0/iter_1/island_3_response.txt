## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to normalize the positions of objects containing the digits "1" and "2" within the grid. Here's a breakdown:

* **Object Identification:** The code first identifies objects containing "1" and "2". An object is defined as a connected group of non-zero digits.
* **Normalization:**  These objects are then moved towards the top-left corner of the grid while maintaining their relative positions.
* **Background Filling:** The remaining space in the grid is filled with zeros. 

**Example:**

Let's take Input_0 as an example:

```
Input_0:
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
3 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 7
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 
```

The objects containing "1" and "2" are identified. The object with "1" is moved to the top left corner, followed by the object containing "2".  All other positions are filled with "0". This results in the following output:

```
Output_0:
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 1 7 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```



## Program Versions and Explanations:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation: 


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj1 = toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I) 
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)
  offset1 = subtract(ORIGIN, ulcorner(obj1))
  offset2 = subtract((height(obj1), ZERO), ulcorner(obj2))
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj1, offset1))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj2, offset2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `obj1` and `obj2` represent the objects containing "1" and "2" respectively, extracted from the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Offsets:**  `offset1` and `offset2` calculate the required shift for each object to align them to the top left corner.
3. **Create Empty Canvas:**  `O` is initialized as a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
4. **Paint Objects:** The objects are painted onto the canvas `O` at their normalized positions.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj1 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I))
  obj2 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I))
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj1, (ZERO, width(obj2))))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj2, ORIGIN))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Normalize Objects:** `obj1` and `obj2` are normalized, moving their upper left corners to the origin.
2. **Create Empty Canvas:** `O` is initialized as before.
3. **Position Objects:** `obj1` is shifted to the right by the width of `obj2`, effectively placing them side by side. `obj2` remains at the origin.
4. **Paint Objects:** The objects are painted onto the canvas.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  obj1 = extract(objs, lambda obj: ONE in palette(obj))
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: TWO in palette(obj))
  offset1 = subtract(ORIGIN, ulcorner(obj1))
  offset2 = subtract((height(obj1), ZERO), ulcorner(obj2))
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj1, offset1))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj2, offset2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  This version first extracts all objects from the grid and then selects the ones containing "1" and "2".
2. **Calculate Offsets & Paint:**  The rest of the logic remains similar to Version 1.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices1 = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  indices2 = ofcolor(I, TWO)
  min_i1, min_j1 = ulcorner(indices1)
  min_i2, min_j2 = ulcorner(indices2)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, j in indices1:
    O = fill(O, ONE, {(i - min_i1, j - min_j1)})
  for i, j in indices2:
    O = fill(O, TWO, {(i - min_i2 + height(indices1), j - min_j2)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Indices:**  This version directly works with indices of the target digits.
2. **Calculate Minimum Indices:** It identifies the top-left corner indices for both sets of digits.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates through the indices and fills the canvas `O` accordingly.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj1 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I))
  obj2 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I))
  combined_obj = shift(obj2, (height(obj1), 0))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, (height(I), width(obj1) + width(obj2))), combined_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Normalize Objects:**  Similar to Version 2, objects are normalized first.
2. **Combine Objects:** `obj2` is directly shifted below `obj1`, creating a combined object.
3. **Create Canvas and Paint:**  A canvas of appropriate size is created, and the combined object is painted onto it.
