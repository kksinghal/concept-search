## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by connected digits of the same value (excluding the background color 0). The transformation aims to:

1. **Center the objects:** Each object is moved so that its center of mass aligns with the center of mass of the grid.
2. **Remove Empty Rows and Columns:** Any empty rows or columns at the top, bottom, left, or right edges of the grid are removed. 

Let's break down each example:

**Input_0:** The '3' objects are centered horizontally, and the '7' objects are centered both horizontally and vertically. 

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the '7' objects are centered both ways, and the '3' and '2' objects, which form a single combined object, are centered.

**Input_2:** The '7' objects are centered vertically, while the '3' objects and the combined '2' and '3' objects are centered both vertically and horizontally.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_1b60fb0c(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    grid_center = centerofmass(asindices(I))
    
    def reposition(obj):
        return subtract(grid_center, centerofmass(obj))
    
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        O = move(O, obj, reposition(obj))
    O = compress(O)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Find Grid Center:** `centerofmass(asindices(I))` calculates the center of mass of the entire grid.
3. **Calculate Offset:** `reposition(obj)` calculates the offset needed to move an object's center of mass to the grid's center.
4. **Move Objects:** Iterates through each object and uses `move(O, obj, reposition(obj))` to shift it to the center.
5. **Compress Grid:** `compress(O)` removes any resulting empty rows and columns. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_1b60fb0c(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
        obj_center = centerofmass(obj)
        grid_center = centerofmass(asindices(I))
        offset = subtract(grid_center, obj_center)
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, offset)) 
    O = compress(O)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Calculate:** Iterates through each object, calculates its center and the grid's center, and determines the offset for centering.
2. **Paint and Cover:** Uses `paint` and `cover` to efficiently move the object by first "erasing" it (`cover`) and then "drawing" it (`paint`) at the offset position.
3. **Compress:**  Removes empty rows and columns after all objects are centered.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_1b60fb0c(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    centered_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, subtract(centerofmass(asindices(I)), centerofmass(obj))) for obj in objs)
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in centered_objs:
        O = paint(O, obj)
    O = compress(O)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Center Objects:** Calculates the offset and uses `shift` to center each object, creating a new set of `centered_objs`.
2. **Create Blank Canvas:** Generates a blank canvas (`canvas`) of the same size and background color as the input.
3. **Paint Objects:** Paints each centered object onto the blank canvas.
4. **Compress:** Removes any empty rows and columns.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_1b60fb0c(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), v))
        offset = subtract(centerofmass(asindices(I)), centerofmass(obj))
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
    O = compress(O)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** Starts with a blank canvas.
2. **Iterate by Color:** Iterates through each unique color (excluding background) in the input.
3. **Center and Paint:**  Finds an object of that color, calculates the offset for centering, and paints the shifted object onto the canvas.
4. **Compress:** Removes empty rows and columns. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_1b60fb0c(I):
  def reposition(obj):
    ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)
    gi, gj = centerofmass(asindices(I))
    return gi - ci, gj - cj
    
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    O = move(O, obj, reposition(obj))
  O = trim(O)
  while len(set(O[0])) == 1: 
    O = O[1:]
  while len(set(O[-1])) == 1:
    O = O[:-1]
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Reposition Function:**  Defines a function `reposition` to calculate the offset for centering an object.
2. **Move Objects:** Iterates through each object in the grid and moves it to the center using the calculated offset.
3. **Trim Edges:** `trim(O)` removes one layer of rows and columns from all four edges of the grid.
4. **Remove Empty Rows:** Iteratively removes empty rows from the top and bottom of the grid until a non-empty row is encountered.
