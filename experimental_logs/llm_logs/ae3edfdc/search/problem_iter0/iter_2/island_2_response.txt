## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to shift specific objects (those containing digits 1, 2, or 3) within the grid to align vertically with the digit '1'. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** 
* The object containing '1' doesn't move (as it's already in the desired position).
* Objects containing '2' and '3' are moved vertically so that their topmost point aligns with the row containing '1'. 

**Pair 1:** 
* Similar to pair 0, objects containing '2' and '3' are moved vertically to align with the row containing '1'.

**Pair 2:**
* The object with '1' is lower than the objects with '2' and '3'. 
* The objects with '2' and '3' are moved down to align with the '1'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = first(extract(asindices(I), lambda ij: I[ij[0]][ij[1]] == 1))
  target_objs = mfilter(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: any(v in {1, 2, 3} for v, _ in obj))
  offsets = {obj: (one_loc[0] - uppermost(obj), 0) for obj in target_objs}
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in target_objs:
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, offsets[obj]))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' location:** `one_loc` stores the coordinates of the digit '1'.
2. **Find target objects:** `target_objs` stores objects containing 1, 2, or 3.
3. **Calculate offsets:**  For each object, calculate the vertical offset needed to align its top with the row of '1'.
4. **Create empty grid:** `new_grid` is initialized with the same dimensions as input.
5. **Paint shifted objects:**  Each object from `target_objs` is shifted using its calculated offset and painted onto `new_grid`.
6. **Return:** The transformed grid `new_grid` is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_row = first(extract(asindices(I), lambda ij: I[ij[0]][ij[1]] == 1))[0]
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      v if v not in {1, 2, 3} else I[one_row][j]
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' row:** `one_row` stores the row index containing the digit '1'.
2. **Iterate and replace:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid. If the cell's value is 1, 2, or 3, it's replaced by the value in the same column but on the `one_row`. Otherwise, the cell remains unchanged.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_i, one_j = first(extract(asindices(I), lambda ij: I[ij[0]][ij[1]] == 1))
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      I[one_i][j] if v in {1, 2, 3} else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' location:** `one_i`, `one_j` store the row and column indices of '1'.
2. **Iterate and replace:** The code iterates through each cell. If the cell value is 1, 2, or 3, it's replaced by the value at the same column index (`one_j`) but on the row `one_i`. Otherwise, the cell is unchanged.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_row = first(extract(asindices(I), lambda ij: I[ij[0]][ij[1]] == 1))[0]
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    if any(v in {1, 2, 3} for v, (i, j) in obj):
      new_obj = shift(obj, (one_row - uppermost(obj), 0))
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, new_obj)
    else:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' row:** `one_row` stores the row index of '1'.
2. **Create empty grid:** `new_grid` is initialized.
3. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through all objects. 
4. **Shift and paint:** If an object contains 1, 2, or 3, it's shifted vertically to align with `one_row` and painted onto `new_grid`.  Objects without those values are painted directly onto `new_grid` without shifting.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = first(extract(asindices(I), lambda ij: I[ij[0]][ij[1]] == 1))
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      I[one_loc[0]][j] if any(I[k][j] in {1, 2, 3} for k in range(len(I))) else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' location:** `one_loc` stores the coordinates of '1'.
2. **Iterate and replace:** The code iterates through each cell. If any cell in the current column contains 1, 2, or 3, the current cell is replaced by the value at the same column but on the row of `one_loc`. Otherwise, the cell is unchanged.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each leveraging different combinations of functions from the DSL.
