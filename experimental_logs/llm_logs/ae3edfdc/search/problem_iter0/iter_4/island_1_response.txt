## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers around the digits '2' and '1' in the input grid. Here's a breakdown:

* **Identify the 'anchor':**  The transformation locates the digit '1' in the input grid. This acts as the "anchor" point.
* **Relocate '2' relative to the anchor':** The digit '2' from the input grid is moved and placed one cell to the right of the anchor '1'.
* **Clear other occurrences of '2':** All other occurrences of the digit '2' in the grid are replaced with the background color '0'. 

Let's look at the examples:

* **Input_0:** The '2' at (4, 3) is moved to (10, 4) - one cell to the right of the anchor '1' at (10, 3). The other '2' at (5, 1) is replaced by '0'.
* **Input_1:** The '2' at (10, 6) is moved to (10, 7) - one cell to the right of the anchor '1' at (10, 6). There are no other occurrences of '2' in this example.
* **Input_2:** The '2' at (11, 6) is moved to (7, 7) - one cell to the right of the anchor '1' at (7, 6). The other occurrences of '2' at (11, 2) and (11, 9) are replaced by '0'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    anchor = first(ofcolor(I, ONE)) # Find the anchor '1'
    twos = ofcolor(I, TWO)  # Find all occurrences of '2'
    target = add(anchor, RIGHT) # Calculate target location for '2'
    relocate = intersection({target}, twos) # Check if '2' exists at target
    remove = difference(twos, relocate) # Find other '2's to remove
    O = paint(fill(I, ZERO, remove), {(TWO, target)}) # Fill and paint
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find anchor and targets:** 
    *   `anchor = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))`: Finds the location of the '1'.
    *   `twos = ofcolor(I, TWO)`:  Finds the locations of all '2's.
    *   `target = add(anchor, RIGHT)`: Calculates the target location for '2', one cell to the right of the anchor.

2. **Relocate and Remove:**
    *   `relocate = intersection({target}, twos)`: Checks if a '2' already exists at the target location. 
    *   `remove = difference(twos, relocate)`: Identifies any other '2's that need to be removed.

3. **Paint:**
    *   `O = paint(fill(I, ZERO, remove), {(TWO, target)})`: First, it fills the locations of '2's to be removed with '0'. Then, it paints a '2' at the target location.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE)) # Find the anchor '1'
    two_loc = extract(ofcolor(I, TWO), lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT) == one_loc)  # Find the '2' to be moved
    O = paint(fill(I, ZERO, ofcolor(I, TWO)), {(TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))})  # Clear all '2's and paint at the new location
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Locate '1' and '2':** 
    *   `one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))`:  Gets the location of the '1'.
    *   `two_loc = extract(ofcolor(I, TWO), lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT) == one_loc)`:  Finds the location of the '2' that needs to be moved (the one to the left of the '1').

2. **Clear and Paint:**
    *   `O = paint(fill(I, ZERO, ofcolor(I, TWO)), {(TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))})`: 
        *   `fill(I, ZERO, ofcolor(I, TWO))`: Clears all existing '2's by replacing them with '0'.
        *   `{(TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))}`: Creates a new '2' at the target location.
        *   `paint(...)`: Applies the changes to the grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, TWO)  # Find all '2' indices
  one_index = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))  # Find the '1' index
  move_to = add(one_index, RIGHT)  # Calculate the target location
  moved = any(add(idx, RIGHT) == one_index for idx in two_indices)  # Check if a '2' is already at the target
  O = fill(I, ZERO, two_indices) if moved else fill(I, ZERO, difference(two_indices, {subtract(one_index, RIGHT)}))  # Clear '2's based on 'moved'
  O = paint(O, {(TWO, move_to)})  # Paint a '2' at the target
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find and Calculate:** This part is similar to the previous versions, locating '1', '2's, and calculating the target location.

2. **Check for existing '2':**
    *   `moved = any(add(idx, RIGHT) == one_index for idx in two_indices)`: This line iterates through all '2' locations and checks if any '2' is already at the target location (one cell right of '1').

3. **Conditional Clearing:**
    *   `O = fill(I, ZERO, two_indices) if moved else fill(I, ZERO, difference(two_indices, {subtract(one_index, RIGHT)}))`: 
        *   If `moved` is True (a '2' was already at the target), it clears all '2's.
        *   If `moved` is False, it clears all '2's except the one that needs to be moved (the one to the left of '1').

4.  **Paint:** It paints a '2' at the target location like before.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  anchor = first(ofcolor(I, ONE)) # Find the anchor '1'
  twos = ofcolor(I, TWO) # Find all '2' locations
  to_move = extract(twos, lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT) == anchor) # Find the '2' to move
  O = paint(fill(I, ZERO, difference(twos, {to_move})), {(TWO, add(anchor, RIGHT))})  # Clear other '2's and paint at new location
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 2, but instead of clearing all '2's and repainting, it specifically identifies the '2' to be moved (`to_move`) and excludes it from the clearing process. This makes the code more efficient.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  one_idx = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))  # Find the '1' index
  two_idx = extract(ofcolor(I, TWO), lambda idx: manhattan(idx, one_idx) == 1 and idx != add(one_idx, RIGHT)) # Find the '2' adjacent to '1' but not to its right
  O = fill(I, ZERO, ofcolor(I, TWO))  # Clear all '2's
  O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(one_idx, RIGHT))})  # Paint the '2' at the target location
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `manhattan` distance to find the '2' that's directly adjacent to the '1' but not to its right. It then clears all '2's and paints one at the target. 

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version offers its own logic and function combination, highlighting the flexibility and power of the DSL.
