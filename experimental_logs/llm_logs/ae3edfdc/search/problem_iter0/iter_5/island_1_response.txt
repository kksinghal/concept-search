## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to move all digits except the digit '1' to the last row while maintaining their relative horizontal positions. The '1' acts as an anchor, and the other digits align themselves to the right of this anchor in the last row. 

**Let's break it down for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 & Output_0:** 
    * The '1' at (10, 11) acts as the anchor.
    * The digits '3', '2', '7', and '7' move to the last row, maintaining their relative horizontal spacing from the '1'.
* **Input_1 & Output_1:**
    * The '1' at (2, 3) acts as the anchor.
    * The digits '7', '7', '7', '3', '2', and '3' move to the last row, maintaining their relative horizontal spacing from the '1'.
* **Input_2 & Output_2:**
    * The '1' at (6, 10) acts as the anchor.
    * The digits '7', '7', '3', '2', '3', and '7' move to the last row, maintaining their relative horizontal spacing from the '1'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  anchor = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  digits = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, ZERO))
  shifted_digits = frozenset((i + anchor[0] - len(I) + 1, j) for i, j in digits)
  cleared_grid = fill(I, ZERO, digits)
  painted_grid = paint(cleared_grid, {(I[i][j], (i, j)) for i, j in shifted_digits if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0])}) 
  return painted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the anchor:** Locate the index of the digit '1'.
2. **Identify all digits:** Create a set of indices representing all non-zero digits in the grid.
3. **Calculate new positions:** Shift the indices of the digits to align with the anchor in the last row.
4. **Clear the grid:** Replace all the original digit positions with zeros.
5. **Paint the digits:** Paint the digits onto the cleared grid at their new calculated positions. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE)) 
  last_row = len(I) - 1
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(len(I)))
    digit = extract(column, lambda x: x != ZERO) 
    if digit is not None:
      O = paint(O, {(digit, (last_row, one_loc[1] + j - column.index(digit)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the anchor:** Locate the index of the digit '1'.
2. **Create an empty canvas:** Generate a grid filled with zeros, maintaining the dimensions of the input grid.
3. **Iterate through columns:**  For each column in the input grid:
   * Extract the non-zero digit in that column.
   * Calculate its new position in the last row, maintaining its relative distance from the anchor.
   * Paint the digit onto the canvas at the calculated position.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  anchor_j = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))[1] 
  O = tuple(tuple(ZERO for _ in range(len(I[0]))) for _ in range(len(I)))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, val in enumerate(row):
          if val != ZERO:
              new_j = anchor_j + j - i
              if 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
                  O = paint(O, {(val, (len(O) - 1, new_j))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the anchor column:**  Get the column index of the '1'.
2. **Create an empty canvas:** Generate a grid filled with zeros, maintaining the dimensions of the input grid.
3. **Iterate through grid cells:**  For each cell in the input grid:
    * If the cell contains a non-zero digit, calculate its new column position relative to the anchor column.
    * If the calculated position is within the grid boundaries, paint the digit onto the canvas in the last row at the new column position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_idx = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  objects = objects(I, False, False, True)
  shifted_objects = frozenset(shift(obj, (one_idx[0] - len(I) + 1, 0)) for obj in objects)
  cleared_grid = fill(I, ZERO, asindices(I))
  painted_grid = cleared_grid
  for obj in shifted_objects:
    painted_grid = paint(painted_grid, obj)
  return painted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the anchor:** Locate the index of the digit '1'.
2. **Identify objects:**  Identify all non-background objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the grid.
3. **Shift the objects:**  Shift each object vertically to align with the last row.
4. **Clear the grid:** Replace all values in the grid with zeros.
5. **Paint the shifted objects:** Paint each shifted object onto the cleared grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  anchor_j = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))[1]
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
      for j in range(len(I[0])):
          if I[i][j] != ZERO:
              new_j =  j + anchor_j - i
              if 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
                  O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (len(I)-1, new_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the anchor column:** Get the column index of the digit '1'.
2. **Create an empty canvas:** Generate a grid filled with zeros, maintaining the dimensions of the input grid.
3. **Iterate through the grid:** For each cell in the input grid:
    * If the cell has a non-zero digit, calculate its new column position relative to the anchor column.
    * If the calculated position falls within the grid's boundaries, paint the digit onto the canvas in the last row at the new column position.
