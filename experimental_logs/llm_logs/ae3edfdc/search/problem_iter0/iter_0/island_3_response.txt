## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected areas of the same digit) and repositioning them to create a specific arrangement.  The arrangement aligns objects vertically based on their leftmost column, leaving empty columns between objects.

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's analyze the transformation from Input_0 to Output_0:

1. **Object Identification:** Several objects exist in Input_0: a "3" in the top row, a "3" in the fifth row, a "2" in the fifth row, a "7" in the seventh row, etc.
2. **Vertical Alignment:** In Output_0, these objects are aligned vertically based on their starting column in the input: 
    - The top row "3" remains in the first column.
    - The fifth-row "3" and "2" are shifted upward to align with the top "3".
    - The seventh-row "7" is shifted upward to the tenth column.
3. **Spacing:**  Notice that a single empty column separates each vertically aligned object in the output.

The same logic applies to Input_1 and Input_2, demonstrating consistent transformation rules.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) 
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
    shift_offset = (0, -leftmost_col)  
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, shift_offset)
    shifted_objs = insert(shifted_obj, shifted_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(...)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid (`I`).
2. **`for obj in objs:`:**  Iterates through each detected object.
3. **`leftmost_col = ...`:**  Finds the leftmost column index of the object.
4. **`shift_offset = ...`:**  Calculates the offset to align the object to the first column.
5. **`shifted_obj = ...`:**  Shifts the object using the calculated offset.
6. **`shifted_objs = ...`:** Adds the shifted object to the set of shifted objects.
7. **`O = paint(...)`:** Creates an empty canvas (`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`) and paints all shifted objects onto it, effectively creating the output grid (`O`) with the desired alignment. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  aligned_objs = frozenset()
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=leftmost)):
    offset = (0, 2*i - leftmost(obj)) 
    aligned_objs = insert(shift(obj, offset), aligned_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(aligned_objs)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(...)`:** Identifies objects in the input grid.
2. **`sorted(objs, key=leftmost)`:** Sorts objects based on their leftmost column.
3. **`for i, obj ...`:** Iterates through sorted objects with their index (`i`).
4. **`offset = ...`:** Calculates the offset to align each object to the first column with spacing (2 times its index).
5. **`aligned_objs = ...`:**  Adds the shifted object to the set of aligned objects.
6. **`O = paint(...)`:**  Paints the aligned objects onto a blank canvas to generate the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), key=leftmost)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 2 * i - leftmost(obj)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = sorted(...)`:** Identifies and sorts objects by their leftmost column.
2. **`O = canvas(...)`:**  Creates an empty canvas for the output.
3. **`for i, obj ...`:**  Iterates through sorted objects.
4. **`O = paint(...)`:**  Paints each object onto the canvas after shifting it to its aligned position with spacing.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for j in range(width(I)):
        column_obj = frozenset({(I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] != ZERO}) 
        if column_obj:
            O = paint(O, shift(column_obj, (0, -j * 2))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(...)`:**  Creates an empty canvas.
2. **`for j in range(width(I))`:**  Iterates through each column of the input.
3. **`column_obj = ...`:** Extracts the object in the current column (if any).
4. **`if column_obj:`:**  If an object exists in the column:
    -  **`O = paint(...)`:** Paint the object onto the canvas after shifting it horizontally to its aligned position with spacing.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    O = canvas(ZERO, (height(I), 2 * len(objs) - 1)) 
    for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=leftmost)):
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 2 * i - leftmost(obj)))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(...)`:**  Identifies objects in the input.
2. **`O = canvas(...)`:** Creates an empty canvas with width adjusted for object alignment and spacing.
3. **`for i, obj ...`:** Iterates through objects sorted by their leftmost column.
4. **`O = paint(...)`:**  Paints each object onto the canvas after shifting it to its aligned position.
