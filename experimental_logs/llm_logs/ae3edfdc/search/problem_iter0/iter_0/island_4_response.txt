## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to involve the following steps:

1. **Isolate Non-Background Objects:** The transformation focuses on the digits that are not the background color (which is `0` in all examples). 
2. **Vertical Stacking:**  The non-background objects are stacked vertically, maintaining their relative horizontal positions.
3. **Center Alignment:** The stacked objects are then centered horizontally within the grid.

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's take Input_0 as an example:

```
Input_0:
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
3 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 7
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 
```

The non-background digits are `3`, `2`, `7`, and `1`. After the transformation, they are stacked vertically and centered horizontally:

```
Output_0:
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 1 7 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

The same logic applies to Input_1 and Input_2.

## Code Generation:

**Note:** Since you haven't provided the two existing programs you want to improve upon, I will assume they are structured similarly to Program A and B, utilizing functions like `objects`, `colorfilter`, `shift`, `fill`, etc.

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" aiming to achieve the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def solve_stacked_objects(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T) # Extract non-background objects
    stacked = frozenset()
    offset = (0, 0)
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
        shifted = shift(obj, offset)
        stacked |= shifted
        offset = (offset[0] + height(obj), 0)  # Update offset for next object
    center_offset = ((15 - height(stacked)) // 2, (15 - width(stacked)) // 2) # Calculate center offset
    centered_objs = shift(stacked, center_offset) 
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 15)), centered_objs) # Paint objects onto empty canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Non-Background Objects:**  Uses `objects` to get all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Stack Objects:** Iterates through the objects, shifting each one downwards by its height and accumulating them in `stacked`. 
3. **Calculate Center Offset:**  Determines the vertical and horizontal offsets needed to center the stacked objects on the grid.
4. **Center and Paint:** Shifts the `stacked` object to the calculated center position and paints it onto an empty canvas of the same dimensions as the input.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def solve_stacked_objects(I):
    non_bg_indices =  mapply(lambda obj: toindices(obj), objects(I, F, F, T)) # Get indices of non-bg objects
    stacked_indices = frozenset()
    offset = (0, 0)
    for indices in non_bg_indices:
        shifted_indices = shift(indices, offset)
        stacked_indices |= shifted_indices
        offset = (offset[0] + height(indices), 0) # Update offset for next object
    center_offset = ((15 - height(stacked_indices)) // 2, (15 - width(stacked_indices)) // 2)
    centered_indices = shift(stacked_indices, center_offset)
    O = fill(canvas(0, (15, 15)), 1, centered_indices) # Fill with 1 at centered indices
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Non-Background Indices:**  Gets indices of all non-background cells using `objects` and `toindices`.
2. **Stack Indices:** Similar to Version 1, but operates on indices instead of objects, accumulating them in `stacked_indices`.
3. **Calculate Center Offset:** Same as Version 1.
4. **Center and Fill:** Shifts `stacked_indices` to the center and fills an empty canvas with `1` at those indices. 

### Program Version 3: 

```python
def solve_stacked_objects(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  height_acc = (0, 0)
  stacked = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    height_acc = (height_acc[0] + height(obj), 0)
    stacked = stacked | shift(obj, (height_acc[0] - height(obj), 0))
  center_offset = ((15 - height_acc[0]) // 2, (15 - width(stacked)) // 2)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(stacked, center_offset))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract non-background objects like in previous versions.
2. **Iterative Stacking and Shifting:**  Iterates through objects, accumulating their height and using it to shift the current object downwards before merging it into the `stacked` set.
3. **Centering and Painting:**  Similar to previous versions, it calculates the center offset and paints the shifted `stacked` set onto a blank canvas.

### Program Version 4: 

```python
def solve_stacked_objects(I):
  non_bg_cells =  mapply(lambda obj: toobject(toindices(obj), I), objects(I, F, F, T))
  stacked_cells = frozenset()
  height_acc = (0, 0)
  for cell in non_bg_cells:
    height_acc = (height_acc[0] + height(cell), 0)
    stacked_cells = stacked_cells | shift(cell, (height_acc[0] - height(cell), 0))
  center_offset = ((15 - height_acc[0]) // 2, (15 - width(stacked_cells)) // 2)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(stacked_cells, center_offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Non-Background Cells:** Extracts individual cells belonging to non-background objects.
2. **Iterative Cell Stacking and Shifting:**  Similar to Version 3, but stacks individual cells instead of whole objects.
3. **Centering and Painting:** Same as Version 3.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def solve_stacked_objects(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  v_offset = (0, 0)
  new_objs = set()
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    new_objs.add(shift(obj, v_offset))
    v_offset = (v_offset[0] + height(obj), 0)
  combined_obj = merge(new_objs)
  h_offset = ((15 - width(combined_obj)) // 2, 0)
  final_obj = shift(combined_obj, h_offset)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), final_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extracts non-background objects.
2. **Vertical Shifting:** Calculates a vertical offset based on the height of previously stacked objects and applies it to each object before adding it to the `new_objs` set.
3. **Horizontal Centering:** After stacking vertically, calculates a horizontal offset to center the combined object and applies it. 
4. **Painting:**  Paints the final, centered object onto a blank canvas.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation using different DSL functions and logic. Remember that without the exact original programs you want to improve upon, these are just educated guesses.
