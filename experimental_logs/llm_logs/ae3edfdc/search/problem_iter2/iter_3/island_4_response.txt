## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects within the input grid (treating any non-zero digit as part of an object) and then 'sliding' these objects downwards until they hit another object or the bottom of the grid. The 'sliding' process seems to follow these rules:

1. **Vertical Movement:** Objects primarily move downwards.
2. **Collision:** Objects stop when they hit another object directly below them. 
3. **Merging:**  If multiple objects collide with the same object from above, they merge into a single object. This is evidenced by the '1' digit being vertically sandwiched between '7' digits in Output_0 and Output_1.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Note:** Since the two "inspiring" programs were not provided in the prompt, the following solutions are based on the transformation analysis and the provided DSL.  

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True) 
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    lowest_row = lowermost(obj)
    while lowest_row < len(I) - 1 and index(I, (lowest_row + 1, leftmost(obj))) == 0:
      obj = shift(obj, DOWN)
      lowest_row += 1
    new_objs.add(obj)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(new_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We use `objects(I, False, False, True)` to find all non-zero objects in the grid.  `False, False, True` ensures we treat different digits as different objects and exclude the background (0).
2. **Slide Downwards:** For each object, we find its lowest row using `lowermost(obj)`.  We then iteratively shift it down (`shift(obj, DOWN)`) as long as the cell below it is empty (value 0).
3. **Collision Detection:**  The `while` loop ensures we stop sliding when we hit a non-zero cell (another object) or reach the bottom of the grid.
4. **Paint to Canvas:**  Finally, we paint all the shifted objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid using `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))`.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    result = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
        column = [(I[i][j], i) for i in range(len(I))]
        new_column = [0] * len(I)
        k = len(I) - 1
        for val, i in reversed(column):
            if val != 0:
                new_column[k] = val
                k -= 1
        for i in range(len(I)):
            result = fill(result, new_column[i], {(i, j)})
    return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Result:** Create an empty canvas `result` with the same shape as the input grid.
2. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column `j` of the input grid.
3. **Process Column:** 
   - Extract the column data with its row index.
   - Create a new column `new_column` filled with zeros, representing the final column after sliding.
   - Iterate the extracted column in reverse order (bottom-up).
   - If a non-zero value is encountered, place it at the bottommost available position `k` in `new_column` and decrement `k`.
4. **Update Result:** Fill the corresponding column in the `result` grid with the values from the processed `new_column`.
5. **Return Result:** After processing all columns, return the `result` grid.

### Program Version 3: 

**Code:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return dmirror(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shift(obj, (lowermost(backdrop(obj)) - lowermost(obj), 0)) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, False, False, True)` finds all non-zero objects.
2. **Find Bottom Edge:**  For each object, `lowermost(backdrop(obj))` determines the row index of the bottom edge of its bounding box.
3. **Calculate Shift:** Subtract the object's actual lowest row (`lowermost(obj)`) from the bottom edge row to determine the vertical shift distance.
4. **Shift Objects:** `shift(obj, (calculated_shift, 0))` moves each object downwards by the calculated amount.
5. **Paint and Mirror:** The shifted objects are painted onto a blank canvas, and the entire result is flipped vertically using `dmirror`.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  output = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    non_zeros = [(i, I[i][j]) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] != 0]
    new_i = height(I) - 1
    for i, val in reversed(non_zeros):
      output = fill(output, val, {(new_i, j)})
      new_i -= 1
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty canvas `output` of the same size as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column `j` in the input grid.
3. **Extract Non-Zeros:** Create a list `non_zeros` containing (row index, value) pairs for all non-zero values in the current column.
4. **Populate Output:**
   - Start from the bottom row (`new_i = height(I) - 1`) of the output grid.
   - Iterate through the `non_zeros` list in reverse order (bottom-up).
   - For each non-zero value `val`, fill the corresponding cell at (`new_i`, `j`) in the `output` grid with `val`.
   - Move one row up (`new_i -= 1`) to prepare for the next non-zero value.
5. **Return Output:** After processing all columns, return the `output` grid.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  g = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for x, r in enumerate(I):
    nz = [(v, i) for i, v in enumerate(r) if v != 0]
    g = paint(g, {(c, (x, i + len(r) - 1 - k)) for (c, i), k in zip(nz, range(len(nz) - 1, -1, -1))})
  return g
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Grid:** Create a blank canvas `g` of the same dimensions as the input grid `I` using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row `r` of the input grid `I` along with its index `x`.
3. **Find Non-Zero Values:** For each row, identify and store the non-zero values `v` and their corresponding column indices `i` as tuples `(v, i)` in the list `nz`.
4. **Calculate Positions:** For every non-zero value `(c, i)` in `nz`, determine its new column position based on its index `k` within `nz`. The formula `i + len(r) - 1 - k` ensures that the non-zero values are shifted towards the end of the row, simulating a gravity effect.
5. **Paint to Grid:** Paint the non-zero values at their calculated positions on the grid `g` using the `paint` function.
6. **Return Grid:** After processing all rows, return the modified grid `g`.

These are five different approaches to achieve the described transformation in the provided DSL. Each version uses a slightly different logic or function combination, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL.
